%did a bunch of cool stuff, major contributions

\section{Limitations and Outlook} % OK: future research directions

Data collection per area with direct methods is naturally more time and cost intensive than indirect methods, which limits the coverable area with the same effort. 
However covering with direct methods the same area as indirect methods is most likely not needed, and will also result in data processing bottlenecks due to the  high information density. Rather, the high spatial resolution in-depth localized direct data collection methods compliment the indirect methods with large spatial coverage.  Ideally in the future these two data streams would be fused, with a few localized direct measurements which are then extrapolated using the large-scale indirect methods with high spatial coverage to provide detailed, information rich, localized data at scale.
% and direct data which is then extrapolated to scale using indirect methods with high spatial coverage.
