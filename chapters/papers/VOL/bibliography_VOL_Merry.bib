Disease rating and plant protection need new and innovative techniques to address forthcoming challenges and trends in agricultural production that require more precision than ever before. Within this context, hyperspectral sensors and imaging techniques—intrinsically tied to efficient data analysis approaches—have shown an enormous potential to provide new insights into plant-pathogen interactions and for the detection of plant diseases. This article provides an overview of hyperspectral sensors and imaging technologies for assessing compatible and incompatible plant-pathogen interactions. Within the progress of digital technologies, the vision, which is increasingly discussed in the society and industry, includes smart and intuitive solutions for assessing plant features in plant phenotyping or for making decisions on plant protection measures in the context of precision agriculture.},

Each species has a qualitatively unique profile, with variation among individuals, growth stages, and tissues. By the 1950s, entomologists began to recognize the supreme importance of these metabolites in shaping insect herbivore communities. Plant defense theories arose to address observed patterns of variation, but provided few testable hypotheses because they did not distinguish clearly among proximate and ultimate causes. Molecular plant-insect interaction research has since revealed the sophistication of plant metabolic, developmental, and signaling networks. This understanding at the molecular level, rather than theoretical predictions, has driven the development of new hypotheses and tools and pushed the field forward. We reflect on the utility of the functional perspective provided by the optimal defense theory, and propose a conceptual model of plant defense as a series of layers each at a different level of analysis, illustrated by advances in the molecular ecology of plant-insect interactions.},

Elevated ozone concentration affects plant physiology, signalling among plant cells, and production of plant volatiles to different degrees, and threatens crop yields. The preference, behaviour, growth, and development of insect herbivores are impacted due to the changes in plant primary and secondary metabolism brought about by elevated ozone concentration. Elevated ozone concentration influences insect behaviours by changing semiochemicals. Consequently interactions between herbivores and the next trophic levels are greatly affected.

Agricultural practices have profound effects on soil properties, but how these influence crop VOCs remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of agricultural practices on constitutive and herbivore-induced VOC emissions by a major staple crop through soil legacy effects. Methods In a full factorial experiment, we measured VOC emissions by wheat (Triticum aestivum) grown in soil inoculum from wheat-fallow or wheat-cover crop rotations that was subjected to feeding by larvalCephus cinctus. Results (main findings) Under herbivory, plants grown in cover crop inoculum emitted greater total VOCs, including higher concentrations of 2-pentadecanone, an insect repellent, and nonanal, a compound important in the recruitment of natural enemies. Plants grown in fallow inoculum showed no differences in emissions whether under herbivory or not. Soil inoculum did not influence VOC emissions of plants in the absence of larval feeding. Conclusions These results suggest that agricultural practices influence crop VOC emissions through soil legacy effects. Additionally, crops grown in wheat-fallow rotations may be less successful recruiting natural enemies of pests through herbivore-induced VOC signaling.},

Although the bean bug is an economically important pest of soybean, little is known about how the insect locates soybean fields. In this study, we examined the electroantennogram responses of R. pedestris to soybean volatiles and examined the behavioral responses of the adult bean bugs. R. pedestris adults were attracted more to their host-plant soybean, even when physical contact was absent, than to air or a non-host plant. Accordingly, we hypothesized that R. pedestris can recognize soybean through a plant's volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Five VOCs were identified from intact soybean plants at the vegetative stage: (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, 4-ethylbenzaldehyde, alpha-farnesene, and methyl salicylate. Response spectra of the antennae to these volatiles clearly showed that both male and female R. pedestris can detect soybean volatiles. The adult bean bugs did not show behavioral orientation to any individual compounds but showed significant orientation to a particular blend of synthetic soybean volatiles when tested under laboratory conditions. In the field, this soybean volatile blend did not significantly attract the bean bugs, but it did interact synergistically with the aggregation pheromone to attract the bean bugs. These results highlight the role of host plant volatiles in the sensory ecology of R. pedestris and help explain colonization pattern of the bean bugs in soybean fields.},

Volatile terpenes represent one of the most diverse groups of secondary metabolites. We aimed to explore evolutionary patterns of volatile terpene emission. We measured the composition of damage-induced volatile terpenes from 202 Amazonian tree species, spanning the angiosperm phylogeny. Volatile terpenes were extracted with solid-phase micro extraction and desorbed in a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for compound identification. The chemical diversity of the terpene blend showed a strong phylogenetic signal as closely related species emitted a similar number of compounds. Closely related species also tended to have compositionally similar blends, although this relationship was weak. Meanwhile, the ability to emit a given compound showed no significant phylogenetic signal for 200 of 286 compounds, indicating a high rate of diversification in terpene synthesis and/or great variability in their expression. Three lineages (Magnoliales, Laurales, and Sapindales) showed exceptionally high rates of terpene diversification. Of the 70 compounds found in {\textgreater}10\% of their species, 69 displayed significant correlated evolution with at least one other compound.

	abstract = {The European grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana (Denis \& Schiffermuller), is a serious pest in vineyards in North and South America. Mating disruption techniques have been used to control and monitor L. botrana on the basis of its sexual communication. This needs a well-tuned olfactory system, in which it is believed that pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs) are key players that transport pheromones in the antennae of moths. In this study, the selectivity of a PBP, named as LbotPBP1, was tested by fluorescence binding assays against 11 sex pheromone components and 6 host plant volatiles. In addition, its binding mechanism was predicted on the basis of structural analyses by molecular docking and complex and steered molecular dynamics (SMD). Our results indicate that LbotPBP1 binds selectively to sex pheromone components over certain host plant volatiles, according to both in vitro and in silico tests. Thus, chain length (14 carbon atoms) and functional groups (i.e., alcohol and ester) appear to be key features for stable binding. Likewise, residues such as Phe12, Phe36, and Phe118 could participate in unspecific binding processes, whilst Ser9, Ser56, and Trp114 could participate in the specific recognition and stabilization of sex pheromones instead of host plant volatiles. Moreover, our SMD approach supported 11-dodecenyl acetate as the best ligand for LbotPBP1. Overall, the dynamics simulations, contact frequency analysis and SMD shed light on the binding mechanism of LbotPBP1 and could overcome the imprecision of molecular docking, supporting the in vitro binding assays. Finally, the role of LbotPBP1 in the chemical ecology of L. botrana is discussed.},

First, we studied O. sauteri's response to the odour from thrips-infested eggplant [Solamum melongena L. (Solanaceae)] in a laboratory by two-choice experiments using a Y-tube olfactometer. When detached eggplant leaves were used as odour sources, O. sauteri preferred the volatiles from uninfested leaves to clean air. Concerning preferences among differently infested leaves, O. sauteri preferred the volatiles from plants infested with 10-100 thrips per leaf to uninfested leaves, but showed no significant preference for artificially damaged leaves over uninfested leaves. Similar results were obtained when complete plants were tested as the odour source. Second, release and recapture experiments in a greenhouse, a more realistic set of conditions, were conducted to confirm whether a significant preference for infested plants occurred at similar infestation levels as in the laboratory. Trends favouring infested plants were detected at densities of five and 500 thrips per plant; however, at the five thrips per plant, this trend was due to the large deviation seen in infested plants in only one replicate. In light of the low tolerable thrips density of eggplant, it is necessary to confirm whether artificial treatments with chemicals induce the emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles that can attract O. sauteri and prolong its residence time on the leaf.},

	abstract = {Plants can defend themselves against herbivores through activation of defensive pathways and attraction of third-trophic-level predators and parasites. Trophic cascades that mediate interactions in the phytobiome are part of a larger dynamic including the pathogens of the plant itself, which are known to greatly influence plant defenses. As such, we investigated the impact of a phloem-limited bacterial pathogen, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), in cultivated citrus rootstock on a well-studied belowground tritrophic interaction involving the attraction of an entomopathogenic nematode (EPN), Steinernema diaprepesi, to their root-feeding insect hosts, Diaprepes abbreviatus larvae. Using belowground olfactometers, we show how CLas infection interferes with this belowground interaction by similarly inducing the release of a C12 terpene, pregeijerene, and disconnecting the association of the terpene with insect presence. D. abbreviatus larvae that were not feeding but in the presence of a CLas-infected plant were more likely to be infected by EPN than those near uninfected plants. Furthermore, nonfeeding larvae associated with CLas-infected plants were just as likely to be infected by EPN as those near noninfected plants with D. abbreviatus larval damage. Larvae of two weevil species, D. abbreviatus and Pachnaeus litus, were also more attracted to plants with infection than to uninfected plants. D. abbreviatus larvae were most active when exposed to pregeijerene at a concentration of 0.1 mu g/mu l. We attribute this attraction to CLas-infected plants to the same signal previously thought to be a herbivore-induced plant volatile specifically induced by root-feeding insects, pregeijerene, by assessing volatiles collected from the roots of infected plants and uninfected plants with and without feeding D. abbreviatus. Synthesis. Phytopathogens can influence the structuring of soil communities extending to the third trophic level. Field populations of EPN may be less effective at host-finding using pregeijerene as a cue in citrus grove agroecosystems with high presence of CLas infection.},

We supposed that each (especially characteristic) chemical in floral scents may play a specific role in mediating pollinator behaviours and tested this supposition in a fig-fig wasp mutualism. Ficus curtipes is obligately pollinated by an undescribed Eupristina species. In the scent of F. curtipes receptive figs, over 50 compounds have been identified, and the scent is dominated by two compounds, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol (OL) and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (NE). We therefore tested the roles of the two major chemicals in mediating the pollinator behaviours. Our results show that OL and NE, respectively, act as a long-distance attractant and a fig-entry behaviour stimulant to the obligate pollinator wasp. Namely, OL attracts the wasps to the figs and NE guides the wasps into the figs. This finding on the work division of floral scent compounds partially explains the maintenance mechanism of the fig-fig wasp mutualism and the significance of the chemical diversity of floral scent in plant-pollinator interactions, especially in specialised pollination systems.},

Host plants were infected with a variety of microorganisms, and larval fitness was correlated to the infected state of the substrate. Our results show an oviposition preference for volatiles that is significantly correlated with the fitness of the substrate. The chemical profiles of the bouquets from each V. vinifera-microorganism system are clearly differentiated in a PCA analysis. Both the volatile signal and the quality of the plant as larval food were affected by the introduction of microorganisms. Our study represents a broad approach to the study of plant-insect interactions by considering not only the direct effect of the plant but also the effect of plant-microorganism interactions on insect population dynamics.

	abstract = {To forage nonrandomly, animals must discriminate among food items. Foods differ in look, smell and taste, providing cues for foragers with appropriate senses. Irrespective of the sensory modality, however, foragers can only use cues effectively if they can detect sensory signals above background noise. Recent evidence shows that foraging mammalian herbivores can detect plant odours, but their capacity to select preferred plants in a noisy olfactory background is unknown. Using choice trials, we tested whether the African elephant, Loxodonta africana, uses plant odour as a salient cue despite increasingly complex and challenging background odours. We first established their preference for familiar plant species. We then tested their capacity to discriminate and select preferred plants based on odour alone. We found that elephants successfully chose preferred species even when presented with complex background odours from nonpreferred plants mimicking multispecies vegetation patches. Elephants also succeeded despite our attempt to mask distinguishing odours with large amounts of a synthetic green leaf volatile. GC-MS analysis confirmed that volatile organic compound profiles differed between plant species. In demonstrating that elephants exploit plant odours even when the signal from preferred plants is embedded in sensory noise of background odours, we provide crucial behavioural evidence that olfaction provides an efficient mechanism for selective, nonrandom foraging. Whether mammalian herbivores recognize novel odours, for example from newly invading plant species, or when air pollution degrades odours of familiar plants, needs investigating. Accounting for the capacity of mammalian herbivores to use plant odour cues will improve models of both their foraging behaviour and the ecosystem impacts of their foraging.

	abstract = {Successful management of insect crop pests requires an understanding of the cues and spatial scales at which they function to affect rates of attack of preferred and non-preferred host plants. A long-standing conceptual framework in insect-plant ecology posits that there is hierarchical structure spanning host location, acceptance and attack that could be exploited for integrated pest management. We investigated how plant- and insect-derived chemical cues affect successive decisions of host choice in aggregating insects, and tested predictions in theCucurbita pepo-Acalymma vittatumsystem.Acalymma vittatumis an aggregating specialist beetle pest that strongly prefers zucchini (C. p. pepo) to summer squash (C. p. ovifera), two independent domesticates ofC. pepo. We hypothesized that subspecies-specific plant traits, especially volatile cues, interact with the male-produced aggregation pheromone to amplify beetle preference forC. p. pepo. Differential beetle attack ofC. peposubspecies in the field is not determined by plant traits that affect host finding or differential aggregation due to pheromones: across two years, beetles had strong density-dependent attraction to both subspecies when male beetles were feeding, and no interactions between plant volatiles and the male-produced pheromone were detected. In the absence of male pheromone emission, beetles were equally unattracted to plants with or without beetle feeding. In contrast, plant traits that mediate insect acceptance appear to underlie differences in preference. At a local scale, beetles did not accept and emigrated fromC. p. oviferacompared toC. p. pepo. Distinct volatile emissions were observed between subspecies, but further work is needed to identify if these volatiles promote emigration. Synthesis and applications. By dissecting pest preference during successive host choice decisions, we isolated a trait with implications for pest management. Beetles on cucurbits can be managed by employing cultivars with differential susceptibility (e.g. trap cropping), and the mechanistic knowledge presented here informs best practices and limitations for on-farm applications. More broadly, pest management in diversified cropping systems can be enhanced through understanding how plant preference gradients affect herbivore movement and behaviour, and plant breeders can target traits to reduce herbivory in such systems.},

The remarkable advantage of torenia over other ornamental plant species is the availability of an easy and high-efficiency transformation system for it. Unfortunately, most of the current torenia research is still not very widespread, because this species has not become prominent as an alternative to other successful model plants such as Arabidopsis, snapdragon and petunia. However, nowadays, a more global view using not only a few selected models but also several additional species are required for creating innovative ornamental traits and studying horticultural ecosystems. We therefore introduce and discuss recent research on torenia, the family Scrophulariaceae, for secondary metabolite bioengineering, in which global insights into horticulture, agriculture and ecology have been advanced. Floral traits, in torenia particularly floral color, have been extensively studied by manipulating the flavonoid biosynthetic pathways in flower organs. Plant aroma, including volatile terpenoids, has also been genetically modulated in order to understand the complicated nature of multi-trophic interactions that affect the behavior of predators and pollinators in the ecosystem. Torenia would accordingly be of great use for investigating both the variation in ornamental plants and the infochemical-mediated interactions with arthropods.},

An emerging understanding of non-canonical reactions (reactions which occur independently of canonical reactions) suggests that the physical chemistry of compounds may play a larger role in constraining chemo-diversity than previously thought. We selected 24 studies of plant volatile profiles, satisfying a defined set of criteria, to assess the extent of correlation among profiles attributable to either shared biosynthetic enzymes or physiochemical properties. Across studies, regardless of treatment, 0.17 (+/- 0.16 SD) adjustedR(2)was attributed to both shared biosynthetic enzymes and physiochemical properties; however, there were no significant differences between the amount of unique variance attributed to shared enzymes (0.05 +/- 0.08 SD) or physiochemical properties (0.03 +/- 0.06 SD). The amount of unique variance explained by physiochemical properties, independent of their canonical relationships, provides a metric for evaluating the role of non-enzymatic and non-canonical reactions in constraining molecular diversity.},

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that chemical cues play a pivotal role in host selection by the natural enemies of aphids. We use Vinson's (1976) division of the host selection process into habitat location, host location and host acceptance for both parasitoids and predators and review what is known about the role of semiochemicals in aphid selection by natural enemies. For habitat location (i.e. detection of the host plant), volatiles emitted by plants after aphid attack have been described for a number of plant-aphid interactions. These synomones indicate not only the presence of an aphid host plant to the predator or parasitoid, but also the presence of aphids. Volatiles emitted from undamaged host plants are often attractive to aphid parasitoids, but less so for predators. Host location by the natural enemy on the food plant is guided by semiochemicals that mostly originate from the aphids, in particular aphid alarm pheromone, honeydew, or the smell of the aphid itself. Host acceptance is guided by contact chemicals for both predators and parasitoids. In parasitoids, host recognition may be based on visual cues or on contact chemicals on the aphid's cuticle, whereas host acceptance is ultimately based on as yet unknown substances within the aphid's hemolymph. While it appears that many predators and parasitoids are attracted to the same semiochemicals, synergistic and antagonistic interactions among chemical substances have only rarely been investigated. More research into model systems is needed, not only to identify important semiochemicals, but also to determine their range of attraction. Recent progress in the development of analytical techniques has created new opportunities to improve our understanding of the chemical ecology of aphid-natural enemy interactions in the coming years.},

Recent studies have shown that birds can exploit herbivore-induced plant volatiles and sexual pheromones of adult insects to locate their prey. Many insectivorous birds prey on immature insects, providing relevant ecosystem services as pest regulators in natural and agricultural ecosystems. We asked whether birds could rely on chemical cues emitted by the immature stages of insects to prey on them. To address this question, we performed field experiments to evaluate if insectivorous birds can detect the aggregation pheromone produced by the larvae of the carpenter worm, Chilecomadia valdiviana. Groups of five artificial larvae were placed in branches of 72 adult trees in a remnant fragment of a sclerophyllous forest in central Chile. Each grouping of larvae contained a rubber septum loaded with either larval pheromone as treatment or solvent alone as control. We found that the number of larvae damaged by bird pecks was significantly higher in groups with dispensers containing the larval extract than in control groups. Our results show that birds can rely on immature insect-derived chemical cues used for larvae aggregation to prey on them.},

In a recent study we showed that an ozone concentration of 80 ppb, commonly encountered in nature, significantly reduces the distance over which plant-plant signaling occurs in lima bean. We went on to show that degradation of herbivore-induced plant volatiles by ozone is the likely mechanism for this. The key question remaining from our work was that if ozone is degrading the signal in transit between plants, which chemicals are responsible for transmitting the signal in purer air? Here we present the results of a small scale experiment testing the role of the two most significant herbivore-induced terpenes and discuss our results in terms of other reported functions for these chemicals in plant-plant signaling.},

	abstract = {The European woodwasp (Sirex noctilio) (Hymenoptera: Siricidae), originated from Europe, Asia (Republic of Georgia, and Mongolia) and North Africa, is a major forestry invasive pest in the world. It has been introduced to many countries, causing great economic losses to their pine resources. In 2013, it was first found that the woodwasp invaded China and settled in northeast of China on Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica. Therefore the monitoring techniques are urgently needed to monitor the population transmission situation, in order to control the invasive pest. In this paper, we summarize the reproductive behavior and chemical ecology regulation in S. noctilio. As to reproductive behavior, males emerge a few days to weeks earlier than females and male's population is more abundant than female's. Its eclosion is affected by climate and the height of the eclosion hole on the trunk. Males aggregate in the upper tree branches for brighter light there. Courtship behavior is regulated by physical factors (light and sound) and chemical factors (host plant volatiles and pheromone). Sirex adults are sexually mature at emergence. Both parthenogenesis and hermaphroditism can be carried out in this insect. If females are parthenogenetic, unmated females oviposit only unfertilized eggs, which develop into males. Once mating happen, mated females can oviposit both fertilized and unfertilized eggs, fertilized eggs develop into females, while unfertilized eggs develop into males. The female can lay eggs after eclosion, and some of them can lay eggs after mating. The amount of laying eggs is affected by temperature and humidity, the shape of female and the symbiotic fungus in the trunk. As to chemical ecological regulation, pheromones from female's cuticle are attractive to males, while pheromones released by males are attractive to either males or virgin females. The release of pheromone is consistent with the mating rhythm. Health and damaged host plant volatile, physiologically stressed trees (pesticide injection and circumcision) in particular, are attractive to S. noctilio, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, aromatic compounds, green leaf volatiles, carbohydrates and so on. There is a dynamic releasing rhythm in volatiles from physiologically stressed hosts. The wasp can carry symbiotic fungus. Volatiles of fungi are composed of monoterpenes, aldehydes, esters and ketones, which can trigger behavioral responses of both wasps and their parasitoids. It is indicated that parasitoids locate the larvae and eggs by symbiotic fungi volatiles. Finally, forest structure improvement, natural enemies and nematode control, satellite remote sensing monitoring, inspection and quarantine are commonly used for monitoring and controlling S. noctilio in forests.},

	abstract = {ADVANCES IN UNDERSTANDING BIOCHEMICAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PLANTS AND INSECTSBiochemical interaction between insects and plants has been a cornerstone of insect ecology, providing critical data on mechanisms of evolution and applications for pest management, and integrating species interactions with biogeochemical cycling. Important groundwork for this topic had been laid by 1900, for example, plant pharmaceutical properties were recognized at least 2500 years ago (Farnsworth, 1966; Hamilton and Baskett, 2000; Millspaugh, 1892), plant variation in susceptibility to insect herbivores by the late 1700s (C. Smith, 2005; Sorensen et al., 2008), and insecticidal properties of some plant products, such as the powdered flower heads of Pyrethrum roseum, by 1800 (C. Riley, 1885).Conceptual synthesis began when R. Painter (1951) recognized that plant resistance to insects could be expressed through antibiosis, antixenosis, and tolerance. Fraenkel (1953) subsequently noted that, since plant species show relatively little variation in nutritional value, resistance to insects must reside in their "secondary metabolites." Major advances in analytical technology (eg, GC-MS equipment) during the 1960s, coupled with conceptual stimulus and serendipity, spurred progress in understanding the chemical mechanisms of insect-plant interactions.Hairston et al. (1960) stimulated research on plant defense by suggesting that plants had little role in regulating herbivore populations. Their "green world hypothesis" was based on a perception that, since herbivores eat so little plant material overall, they must not be food-limited and, therefore, must be limited by predators. We soon learned that a variety of phytochemicals provide effective defense against herbivory (Feeny, 1969, 1970; Rosenthal and Janzen, 1979) and that herbivorous insects show specific adaptations to avoid or detoxify plant defenses (Euw et al., 1967; Xu et al., 2015), thereby limiting the number of host species that could be exploited by a particular herbivore. These data supported a view of an "evolutionary arms race" between plants and insects (Whittaker and Feeny, 1971, but see Berenbaum and Zangerl, 1988).Serendipity played a role when Rhoades (1983) and I. Baldwin and Schultz (1983) independently found evidence, in environmental chambers, that tree seedlings damaged by herbivorous insects communicated this information to neighboring undamaged seedlings, which initiated production of antiherbivore defenses in advance of herbivory. Although their hypothesis that plants communicate the threat of herbivory (popularly termed the "talking tree" hypothesis) was challenged because of apparent lack of an evolutionary mechanism (Fowler and Lawton, 1985), additional research confirmed that volatile elicitors induce defenses in a wide variety of plants, even species unrelated to the signaler (Dolch and Tscharntke, 2000; Farmer and Ryan, 1990; Heil and Karban, 2010; Izaguirre et al., 2013; Karban, 2001; Pearse et al., 2013; M. Stout et al., 2006) and that these plant volatiles also attract predators (Bruinsma and Dicke, 2008; Hare, 2011; Turlings et al., 1990; Wason and Hunter, 2014). However, the fitness benefits for emitter and receiver are still poorly understood (Heil and Karban, 2010).Recent advances in molecular technology have demonstrated genetic mechanisms governing these interactions, typically involving P-450 genes (Berenbaum and Zangerl, 2008; Y. Mao et al., 2007). Insertion of genes for bacterial toxins into crop genomes has permitted measurement of rates at which herbivorous insects adapt and which insect genes are targets for selection (F. Huang et al., 2007).However, plant production of defenses requires energy and nutrients (especially nitrogen) and affects litter quality and the return of nutrients to soil (Holopainen et al., 1995; Schweitzer et al., 2005; Whitham et al., 2006), thereby linking insect-plant interactions to energy flow, biogeochemical cycling, and disturbance regime at the ecosystem level (see Chapters 11 and 12). The contemporary view of insect-plant interaction recognizes a variety of mechanisms and trade-offs that will continue to generate new insights into evolutionary and ecosystem theory.},

Terpenes were shown to mediate the interactions between plants and many organisms including arthropods, nematodes, and other plants. Often, these interactions are based on volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes which are released from the plant after damage by herbivores. The terpenes attract herbivore enemies that attack the herbivore and thereby may reduce the damage to the plant. This interaction was termed 'indirect defense' and will often benefit the plant, but other organisms like parasitic plants or insects and can utilize the volatile signals to their advantage. Despite the relatively low number of volatile terpene-mediated interactions identified today, many more are likely to be discovered with the advance of volatile collection methods and molecular techniques.},

Compared with laboratory and field methods using intact plants or tissues, a cell culture is advantageous because it is not affected by environmental factors, and the experiments are easier to reproduce. When exposed to an elicitor, our cell line produces 10 monoterpenes and beta-thujaplicin, which is a strong phytoalexin. These monoterpenes are emitted into the vapor phase and are expected to play a role in airborne signaling. In the present study, the cells were exposed to monoterpene vapors, and the volatiles present in the culture flasks were monitored. When the culture cells were exposed to low doses of sabinene, we detected gamma-terpinene and p-cymene. After exposure to gamma-terpinene, we found p-cymene and terpinolene, whereas p-cymene exposure resulted in terpinolene emission. By contrast, the other seven monoterpenes we investigated did not induce any emissions of other monoterpenes. These results strongly suggest that in C. lusitanica a signaling cascade exists that starts with the emission of sabinene and moves to gamma-terpinene, p-cymene, and finally to terpinolene, which accelerates the production of the phytoalexin beta-thujaplicin.},

Antennae of both sexes responded electroantennographically to the green leaf volatiles (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenol, 1-hexanol, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, and n-hexyl acetate, all identified from the host plant Quercus suber. In behavioral experiments, only females were attracted to host-plant odors, and in tests with synthetic compounds, females were attracted to (E)-2-hexenol, 1-hexanol, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate. It is likely that these compounds play a role in foraging and/or oviposition behavior of BBOB females.},

Coinfection suppressed the transcription of genes involved in jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway in plants, but showed no significant difference to single-virus infected plants.

These parasitic wasps use herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that provide reliable cues on host presence. However, host searching of hyperparasitoids, a group of parasitoids that parasitize the larvae and pupae of other parasitoids, is more constrained. Their hosts do not feed on plants, and often are even concealed inside the body of the herbivore host. Hyperparasitoids recently have been found to use HIPVs of plants damaged by herbivore hosts in which the parasitoid larvae develop. However, hyperparasitoids that search for these parasitoid larvae may be confronted with healthy and parasitized caterpillars on the same plant, further complicating their host location. In this study, we addressed whether the primary hyperparasitoid Baryscapus galactopus uses caterpillar body odors to discriminate between unparasitized herbivores and herbivores carrying larvae of parasitoid hosts. We show that the hyperparasitoids made faster first contact and spent a longer mounting time with parasitized caterpillars. Moreover, although the three parasitoid hosts conferred different fitness values for the development of B. galactopus, the hyperparasitoids showed similar behavioral responses to caterpillar hosts carrying different primary parasitoid hosts. In addition, a two-chamber olfactometer assay revealed that volatiles emitted by parasitized caterpillars were more attractive to the hyperparasitoids than those emitted by unparasitized caterpillars. Analysis of volatiles revealed that body odors of parasitized caterpillars differ from unparasitized caterpillars, allowing the hyperparasitoids to detect their parasitoid host.},

In this experiment, we find that when the specialist gall-forming fly Eurosta solidaginis (Fitch; Diptera: Tephritidae) attacks its tall goldenrod (Solidago altissima (L.; Asterales: Asteraceae)) host plant, the fly indirectly induces a phytochemical response in nearby tall goldenrod plants. This phytochemical response may, in turn, act as a positive signal attracting the goldenrod specialist aphid Uroleucon nigrotuberculatum (Olive; Hemiptera: Aphididae). Laboratory-based experiments exposing ungalled tall goldenrod plants to the volatiles released by E. solidaginis galls demonstrated a consistent increase in foliar terpenoid concentrations in ungalled plants. Analysis of tall goldenrod stem and gall tissue chemistry revealed induction of terpenoids in gall tissue, with a simultaneous decrease in green leaf volatile concentrations. Field experiments demonstrated a consistent spatial relationship in tall goldenrod foliar terpenoid concentrations with distance from an E. solidaginis gall. Both laboratory and field experiments establish consistent induction of the terpene beta-farnesene, and that this compound is a strong positive predictor of U. nigrotuberculatum aphid presence on goldenrod plants along with plant biomass and several other foliar terpenoids.These findings suggest E. solidaginis induced phytochemistry, especially beta-farnesene, may be acting as a kairomone, driving aphid distribution in the field.},

Previous studies have suggested that insectivorous birds can detect the HIPVs for prey location. The production of HIPVs is partly mediated by the jasmonic acid signalling pathway. Methyl jasmonate is one compound involved in the jasmonic acid signalling pathway. Therefore, spraying of methyl jasmonate (MeJa) solution on plants can induce the emission of volatiles similar to the HIPVs induced by herbivory. We performed two field experiments to test whether insectivorous adult birds are attracted to Pyrenean oak trees (Quercus pyrenaica) treated with MeJa solutions. We used artificial larvae to measure bird predation rate. There were no differences in the predation rates of plasticine larvae between control and MeJa treatments, suggesting that insectivorous birds were not attracted to trees treated with MeJa. We also tested whether blue tit nestlings without previous experience in foraging respond to the scent of Pyrenean oak tree leaves treated with MeJa, to test whether the attraction to MeJa-treated trees is innate. A similar number of nestlings performed begging responses when exposed to the scent of leaves of MeJa-treated trees compared to the scent of leaves of control untreated trees. Furthermore, the duration of the first begging was similar in response to the volatiles emitted by MeJa-treated trees and untreated trees. Despite previous evidence suggesting that insectivorous birds are attracted to HIPVs, our results show that neither insectivorous adult birds nor inexperienced nestlings were attracted to trees treated with MeJa. Further studies are needed to disentangle whether the differences in the emission of volatiles between herbivore-infested trees and MeJa-treated trees can explain this lack of attraction to MeJa-treated Pyrenean oak trees.},

	abstract = {BackgroundExposure of plants to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) alters their resistance to herbivores. However, the whole-genome transcriptional responses of treated plants remain unknown, and the signal pathways that produce HIPVs are also unclear. Methodology/Principal FindingsTime course patterns of the gene expression of Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to Lima bean volatiles were examined using Affymetrix ATH1 genome arrays. Results showed that A. thaliana received and responded to leafminer-induced volatiles from Lima beans through up-regulation of genes related to the ethylene (ET) and jasmonic acid pathways. Time course analysis revealed strong and partly qualitative differences in the responses between exposure at 24 and that at 48 h. Further experiments using either A. thaliana ET mutant ein2-1 or A. thaliana jasmonic acid mutant coi1-2 indicated that both pathways are involved in the volatile response process but that the ET pathway is indispensable for detecting volatiles. Moreover, transcriptional comparisons showed that plant responses to larval feeding do not merely magnify the volatile response process. Finally, (Z)-3-hexen-ol, ocimene, (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, and (3E,7E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene triggered responses in A. thaliana similar to those induced by the entire suite of Lima bean volatiles after 24 and 48 h. Conclusions/SignificanceThis study shows that the transcriptional responses of plants to HIPVs become stronger as treatment time increases and that ET signals are critical during this process.},

Our study comprised choice and no-choice bioassays, aimed at understanding the preference of this oligophagous pest for a few selected solanaceous hosts (tomato, potato, eggplant, ashwagandha, black nightshade, wild tomato, tobacco, and datura), and the identification of the volatile cues that influence its host selection process. In choice assays, T. absoluta females preferred tomato for oviposition over all the other plants, whereas ashwagandha, tobacco, and datura were the least preferred; on datura zero eggs were laid. A similar trend was observed in the subsequent number of larval mines formed. The moth's preference for host plants of the genus Solanum was quite evident in both the choice and no-choice assays. Tomato plant volatiles were found to be more attractive to the female moths in single- and dual-choice olfactometer assays. In electroantennographic bioassays, the mean depolarization was significant for tomato, potato, ashwagandha, and eggplant compared to empty air and honey. In total 76 volatile compounds were identified in the GC-MS analysis across the eight previously selected host-plant headspace samples. Principal component analysis revealed that 1-fluorododecane and p-quinone mainly contributed to the observed variation among the host plant volatiles. Of all the host plants, tomato, wild tomato, and tobacco were found to share similarities with respect to volatile cues, whereas ashwagandha, eggplant, and datura were found to be closely related. The other two hosts, potato and black nightshade, had fewer volatiles in common. Volatile cues, namely p-quinone, 2-carene, delta-curcumene, and 1,2-diethylbenzene, in tomato could serve as oviposition stimulants to T. absoluta, whereas the presence of 1-fluorododecane in host plants such as datura, eggplant, ashwagandha, and black nightshade, might have deterred T. absoluta from ovipositing. 1-Fluorododecane was found to be completely absent in tomato.},

Among the tested PAs, Spm was the most active in inducing the production of volatile terpenoids known to be induced by T. urticae. An increase in JA levels was also found after Spm treatment, indicating that Spm induces the biosynthesis of JA, which has been shown elsewhere to regulate the production of some volatile terpenoids. Further, treatment with JA and Spm together resulted in greater volatile emission than that with JA alone. In a Y-tube olfactometer, leaves treated with SpmJA attracted more predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis) than those treated with JA alone. After treatment with SpmJA, no effects were found on the enzyme activity of polyamine oxidase and copper amine oxidase. However, induction of calcium influx and ROS production, and increased enzyme activities and gene expression for NADPH oxidase complex, superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase were found after treatment with SpmJA.

Nineteen volatile chemicals, with terpenes being the major components, were identified from maize plants attacked by third instar Asian corn borer larvae. Coupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) analyses revealed some electroantennographic differences between female and male Asian corn borer antennae in response to larvae-induced maize volatiles; female responded to (E)-2-hexenal, nonanal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol and three unknown compounds while the male only responded to (E)-2-hexenal, nonanal and one unknown compound. In laboratory orientation bioassays, Asian corn borer neonate larvae were attracted to extracts collected from Asian corn borer-damaged plants as well as to synthetic farnesene, but were repelled by (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol. In laboratory oviposition bioassays, gravid females laid fewer eggs on plants damaged by larvae than on mechanically damaged plants or undamaged plants. Adult Asian corn borer females deposited fewer eggs on wax paper treated with (E)-2-hexenal or (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol than on wax paper treated with hexane (control). The results suggest that Asian corn borer can affect the behaviors of conspecific larvae and adults by changing host plant volatiles.},

Volatiles induced by herbivore feeding are among the best studied plant responses to stress and may constitute an informative message to the surrounding community and further function in plant defence processes. However, under natural conditions, plants are potentially exposed to multiple concurrent stresses with complex effects on the volatile emissions. Atmospheric pollutants are an important facet of the abiotic environment and can impinge on a plant's volatile-mediated defences in multiple ways at multiple temporal scales. They can exert changes in volatile emissions through oxidative stress, as is the case with ozone pollution. The pollutants, in particular, ozone, nitrogen oxides and hydroxyl radicals, also react with volatiles in the atmosphere. These reactions result in volatile breakdown products, which may themselves be perceived by community members as informative signals. In this review, we demonstrate the complex interplay among stresses, emitted signals, and modification in signal strength and composition by the atmosphere, collectively determining the responses of the biotic community to elicited signals.},

	abstract = {Increased plant genotypic diversity in crop fields can promote ecosystem services including pest control, but understanding of mechanisms behind herbivore population responses to cultivar mixtures is limited. We studied aphid settling on barley plants exposed to volatiles from different cultivars, aphid population development in monocultures and two-cultivar mixtures, and differences in volatile composition between studied cultivars. Aphid responses to one cultivar in a mixture were neighbor-specific and this was more important for pest suppression than the overall mixture effect, aphid colonization patterns, or natural enemy abundance. Aphid populations decreased most in a mixture where both cultivars showed a reduced aphid-plant acceptance after reciprocal volatile exposure in the laboratory, and reduced population growth compared to monocultures in the field. Our findings suggest that herbivore population responses to crop genotypic diversity can depend on plant-plant volatile interactions, which can lead to changes in herbivore response to individual cultivars in a mixture, resulting in slower population growth. The impact of plant-plant interaction through volatiles on associated herbivore species is rarely considered, but improved understanding of these mechanisms would advance our understanding of the ecological consequences of biodiversity and guide development of sustainable agricultural practices. Combining cultivars in mixtures based on how they interact with each other is a promising strategy for sustainable pest management.},

	abstract = {1. The aphid alarm pheromone (E)-beta-farnesene (EBF) is often considered to be used by natural enemies as a prey/host finding kairomone. However, studies show opposing results, some appear to confirm an attraction of aphid natural enemies by EBF whereas others do not provide any evidence for the kairomone function of EBF.2. To clarify if aphid natural enemies are attracted by the amounts of EBF naturally emitted by aphids, the existing literature was reviewed about EBF attractiveness to aphid natural enemies with consideration of the amounts of EBF used in the studies.3. Thirty-one publications that investigated the ability of EBF, aphid cornicle secretion, and attacked aphids, to attract aphid natural enemies were found. Several studies showed an attraction by EBF, but these used much higher amounts of EBF than usually emitted by aphids during a predator attack. Studies investigating EBF amounts similar to what is emitted by aphids are rare and failed to show attraction. Only two studies document an attraction of natural enemies by attacked aphids.4. As EBF is emitted in very low amounts, not very stable, and only present after an attack, we suggest that aphid-derived EBF is not a suitable kairomone for most natural enemy species, especially when they are able to use alternative cues. As EBF, amongst other volatiles, is also emitted by herbivore-induced plants, we propose that natural enemies might use plant-derived EBF as a synomone to identify aphid-infested plants via an altered plant volatile bouquet.},

Moreover, in the promoter region of TI, a suite of methylation sites was found to be demethylated by the HIPV treatment.

It is a potential vector of the pine wood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle, the causal agent of the devastating pine wilt disease. Volatiles were collected from both male and female beetles after maturation feeding. In analyses of these collections using gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry, a single male-specific compound was detected and identified as 2-(undecyloxy)-ethanol. In analyses by GC coupled to electroantennography the only consistent responses from both female and male antennae were to this compound. Trapping tests were carried out in Spain, Sweden, and China. 2-(Undecyloxy)-ethanol was attractive to both male and female M.sutor beetles. A blend of the bark beetle pheromones ipsenol, ipsdienol, and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol was also attractive to both sexes in Spain and Sweden, and further increased the attractiveness of the 2-(undecyloxy)-ethanol. The host plant volatiles -pinene, 3-carene, and ethanol were weakly attractive, if at all, in all three countries and did not significantly increase the attractiveness of the blend of 2-(undecyloxy)-ethanol and bark beetle pheromones. 2-(Undecyloxy)-ethanol is thus proposed to be the major, if not only, component of the male-produced aggregation pheromone of M.sutor, and its role is discussed. This compound has been reported as a pheromone of several other Monochamus species and is another example of the parsimony that seems to exist among the pheromones of many of the Cerambycidae. Traps baited with 2-(undecyloxy)-ethanol and bark beetle pheromones should be useful for monitoring and control of pine wilt disease, should M.sutor be proven to be a vector of the nematode.},

	abstract = {Host plant volatiles which attract insect herbivores for egg-laying are of principal interest with respect to insect ecology and evolution. Direct applications concern population monitoring and control through behavioural manipulation. Identification of behaviourally active plant secondary metabolites is essential also for plant breeding for insect resistance. Grapevine moth females Lobesia botrana are attracted by upwind flight to green grape berries Vitis vinifera. The headspace of grape berries was collected on air filters. A solvent extract of these filters, released from a sprayer, attracted females in the wind tunnel. The results demonstrate that volatile cues mediate attraction of grapevine moth females to grape berries, and that headspace collections capture the essence of this odour signal. The air filter extracts were examined by gas chromatography coupled with electroantennographic detection, and the compounds eliciting a consistent antennal response in L. botrana females were identified by mass spectrometry. The headspace collection apparatus was calibrated for collection efficiency of the active compounds. Their recovery rate ranged from 35 \% for methyl salicylate to 83 \% for (E,E)-alpha-farnesene. A synthetic ten-component blend was then formulated. The blend consisted of compounds eliciting an antennal response, formulated in a blend ratio corrected for differences in collection efficiency. Subsequent wind tunnel tests showed that female attraction to this synthetic ten-component blend was not significantly different from attraction to grape berries, or to headspace collections of the same berries. At a release rate of 35 ng/h of the most abundant compound (E)-beta-caryophyllene, 20 \% of the test females approached the source of sprayed headspace collections and the ten-component synthetic blend, respectively. In comparison, 100 g of green berries, releasing the main compound (E)-beta-caryophyllene at a rate of ca. 4.7 ng/h, attracted 10 \% of the females by upwind flight followed by source contact.},

The concealed lifestyle of the stem-borer larvae did not limit the emission of volatiles attractive to a parasitoid. A major source of the attractive volatiles from the plant-host complex was the stem-borer-injured stem, including the frass produced by the feeding larvae. Moreover, the production of volatiles attractive to a parasitoid was not restricted to the infested stem part but occurs systemically throughout the plant. The uninfested leaves of a stem-borer-infested plant were found to emit volatiles that attract female C. flavipes. We further demonstrate that an exogenous elicitor of this systemic plant response is situated in the regurgitate of a stem-borer larva. When a minor amount of regurgitate is inoculated into the stem of an uninfested plant, the leaves of the treated plant emit volatiles that attract female C. flavipes.},

The role of aphid infestation level and duration, systemic production of volatiles by "insect-free" parts of the plant, and the specificity of aphid-induced volatiles on the flight behavior of the foraging female parasitoids were investigated. The upper insect-free part of a three-leaved broad bean plant, which was basally infested by a population of 40 A. pisum, released synomones detectable by A. ervi females after at least 48-72 hr of infestation, resulting in both significant increases iii oriented flights and landings on the source compared with uninfested control plants. This suggests that volatiles involved in host-location by A. ervi are systemically released by broad bean plants either in response to circulation of aphid saliva, circulation of saliva-induced bioactive elicitors, or circulation of the synomones themselves. Air entrainment extracts of volatiles collected from a broad bean plant infested by the nonhost Aphis fabae or an uninfested broad bean plant elicited few oriented flights and landing responses by female parasitoids. These extracts were significantly less attractive than extracts collected from a broad bean plant infested by the host A, pisum, indieating the specificity of synomones elicited by different aphid species on the same plant species.},

	abstract = {Coexistence with other plants is one of the most important factors affecting the growth of plant individuals and the distribution of species. Most research in this area has focused on competition between plants, but recently an understanding has emerged that coexistence can take other forms. Plant released volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be phytotoxic for receiving plants and are commonly employed in plant competition. VOCs can also be used as a source of information by the plant. The information available to the plant through the interpretation of plant volatile signals can help it adapt to surrounding conditions, such as competition, via morphological and physiological changes. These changes can result in alterations of leaf temperature and biomass allocation patterns. The plant can then react to compete when necessary or avoid unfavourable competition. Studies indicate that plants can distinguish between related and non-related plants by means of VOCs. Therefore, VOCs may also play an important role in the kin selection. Volatile signal interpretation and its effects on the plant and subsequent trophic levels have been given the name allelobiosis.},

Here, we show that mycorrhizal mycelia can also act as a conduit for signalling between plants, acting as an early warning system for herbivore attack. Insect herbivory causes systemic changes in the production of plant volatiles, particularly methyl salicylate, making bean plants, Vicia faba, repellent to aphids but attractive to aphid enemies such as parasitoids. We demonstrate that these effects can also occur in aphid-free plants but only when they are connected to aphid-infested plants via a common mycorrhizal mycelial network. This underground messaging system allows neighbouring plants to invoke herbivore defences before attack. Our findings demonstrate that common mycorrhizal mycelial networks can determine the outcome of multitrophic interactions by communicating information on herbivore attack between plants, thereby influencing the behaviour of both herbivores and their natural enemies.},

Orchard treatments with up to 100 grams of synthetic codlemone per hectare effectively control codling moth populations over the entire growing season.

	abstract = {Insect olfactory orientation along odour plumes has been studied intensively with respect to pheromonal communication, whereas little knowledge is available on how plant odour plumes (POPs) affect olfactory searching by an insect for its host plants. The primary objective of this review is to examine the role of POPs in the attraction of insects. First, we consider parameters of an odour source and the environment which determine the size, shape and structure of an odour plume, and we apply that knowledge to POPs. Second, we compare characteristics of insect pheromonal plumes and POPs. We propose a POP concept' for the olfactory orientation of insects to plants. We suggest that: (i) an insect recognises a POP by means of plant volatile components that are encountered in concentrations higher than a threshold detection limit and that occur in a qualitative and quantitative blend indicating a resource; (ii) perception of the fine structure of a POP enables an insect to distinguish a POP from an unspecific odorous background and other interfering plumes; and (iii) an insect can follow several POPs to their sources, and may leave the track of one POP and switch to another one if this conveys a signal with higher reliability or indicates a more suitable resource. The POP concept proposed here may be a useful tool for research in olfactory-mediated plant-insect interactions.},

This fact suggests that odours from the pine trunks are responsible for the olfactory orientation of the beetles. Air was exhausted from hermetic jackets mounted around the pine trunks and odour compounds were absorbed on charcoal traps. In order to avoid contaminations the jackets were made up of stainless steel and teflon film. Odour patterns of pine trunks with different incidence of oviposition and growing under different local conditions were analysed using specialised sampling jackets and the gas chromatographic - mass spectrometry method (GC-MS). Significant differences were observed in the composition of the odour patterns. Potential marker substances for the primary attraction of the blue pine wood borer to damaged pine trunks were specified by analysing electrophysiological responses of Ph. cyanea to the different odour patterns using the gas chromatograph coupled in parallel with an electroantennographic detector and a flame ionisation detector (GC-EAD-FID).},

Host-plant leaves, damaged leaves, host larvae, and host larvae feeding on leaves were highly attractive to female C. urabae, whereas host frass and conspecific males were not. The multiple-comparison bioassay conducted in a four-arm olfactometer clearly indicates that C. urabae females were significantly more attracted to the host Uraba lugensWalker (Lepidoptera: Nolidae) larvae feeding on Eucalyptus fastigata H Deane \& Maiden (Myrtaceae) leaves than to any other of the odour sources tested. The results of this study show that C. urabae individuals responded to chemical cues specific to the host plant and target host insect, and support hypotheses that unreliable cues are not utilized for host location by specific natural enemies.},

	abstract = {Maize roots respond to feeding by larvae of the beetle Diabrotica virgifera virgifera by releasing (E)-β-caryophyllene (Eβc). This insect-induced root volatile attracts entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) and thereby helps to protect the roots against herbivore damage. Previous studies suggest that diffusion of Eβc occurs through the gaseous rather than the aqueous phase in sand and its diffusion is best at low levels of humidity. However, it remains largely unknown how Eβc diffuses in typical natural and agricultural soils. To fully understand the function and efficiency of root-produced Eβc as a belowground signal it is important to know how it spreads in real soils and how soil properties affect its diffusion. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses, the diffusion of two doses of synthetic Eβc (200 ng and 20,000 ng) injected in sand was compared with the diffusion of Eβc injected in clay, clay-loam and sandy-loam soils, at 3 moisture levels (5, 10 and 20\% water), and at two distances (5 and 10cm) from the Eβc injection point. The diffusion of the compound was measured with a Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME) fiber every 30minutes over a period of 9 hours. We found that, in contrast to the pattern observed for pure sand, Eβc diffused best when humidity was high in the three agricultural soils. In subsequent experiments we used glass-trays to create two types of mesocosms to assess the effect of synthetic or root-produced Eβc on the dispersal of the EPN Heterorhabditis megidis and its infection of sentinel hosts in the trays. The presence of synthetic Eβc did not affect the ability of H. megidis to infect the sentinel host. However, under the test conditions, Eβc released from maize roots influenced the migration behaviour of H. megidis depending on soil type. The results suggest that D. virgifera-damaged maize plants may recruit H. megidis more efficiently in clay loam soils than in other types of soil. These new insights into the diffusion dynamics and attraction efficiency of the root-produced signal Eβc may help efforts to develop novel strategies for the sustainable management of the maize pest D. virgifera.},

Changes in the olfactory systems of insects that rely on different host plants, for example, can occur in response to differences in sensory stimuli between habitats. In this study, we investigate the evolution of host preference by characterizing the coeloconic sensilla in Drosophila mojavensis, a species that breeds on different necrotic cacti across its geographic range. These cactus species differ in the volatile chemicals they emit, a primary sensory cue for host plant discrimination. Analysis of odor-evoked responses identified four coeloconic sensilla that were qualitatively similar to those of Drosophila melanogaster, but varied in the breadth and strength of their olfactory sensory neuron responses to some acids and amines. Variation in responses to certain odorants among D. mojavensis populations was also observed. Compared to D. melanogaster, there was a lack of sensitivity of antennal coeloconic type 3 (ac3) sensilla to primary ligands of OR35a across all populations. Consistent with this result was a lack of detectable Or35a gene expression. Using a comparative approach, we then examined odor specificity of ac3 sensilla for seven additional Drosophila species, and found that OR35a-like sensitivity may be limited to the melanogaster subgroup. The variation in specificity that was observed among species is not clearly attributable to the degree of ecological specialization, nor to the ecological niche.},

However, there are currently a number of key gaps in knowledge that have hindered the development of a predictive framework of plant diversity effects on consumers. For instance, we still know very little about how the magnitude of plant trait variation (e.g. intra-specific vs. inter-specific), as well as the identity and combined effects of plant, herbivore and natural enemy traits, mediate plant diversity effects on consumers. Moreover, the fine-scale mechanisms (e.g. changes in consumer behaviour or recruitment responses) underlying such diversity effects in many cases remain elusive or have been overlooked. In addition, most studies of plant diversity effects on associated consumers have been developed under a static, unidirectional (bottom-up) framework of effects on herbivores and predators without taking into account the potential for dynamic feedbacks across trophic levels. Here we seek to address these key gaps in knowledge as well as to capitalize on recent advances and emerging frameworks in plant biodiversity research. In doing so, we provide new insights as well as recommendations which will stimulate new research and advance this field of study.},

To measure the reaction of the receiver in terms of signal release, we used predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis) as an olfactory sensor and tested their behavioural response to the released signals. The results show that intraspecific, as well as interspecific plant–plant information transfer occurs. However, plants are only weakly attractive to predators immediately after taking them away from exposure to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPV), but become significantly more attractive somewhere within a period of ca. 2 days. No evidence was found that HIPV-exposed plants exhibit intensified signal release by the time they are actually attacked by herbivorous mites. Taken together, the predator responses to odour from plants previously exposed to HIPV, were significant, but weak.

In Micro-Tom, all treatments produced similar fruit biomass, but 100\% red light enhanced flavour-related volatiles in foliage.

The irregular C11 homoterpene 4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene 1 originates in higher plants (Angiospermae) from nerolidol 3 by sequential oxidative degradation.

The successful conversion of nerolidol 3, geranylacetone 4, 2,3-dihydroxy-3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-6, 10-diene 6, 1,2-epoxinerolidol 7 and 1,2,3-trihydroxy- 3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-6,10-diene 8 into 1 may be indicative for a sequential degradation in the order 3 → 7 → 8 → 4 → 1 or 3 → 6 → 4 → 1. The chiral centres of the putative intermediates have been characterized and a high degree of enantioselectivity of the involved enzymes has been found.

	abstract = {In natural ecosystems, plants interact with biotic components such as microbes, insects, animals and other plants as well. Generally, researchers have focused on each interaction separately, which condenses the significance of the interaction. This limited presentation of the facts masks the collective role of constantly interacting organisms in complex communities disturbing not only plant responses but also the response of organisms for each other in natural ecological settings. Beneficial microorganisms interact with insect herbivores, their predators and pollinators in a bidirectional way through the plant. Fascinatingly, insects employ diverse tactics to protect themselves from parasites or predators. Influences of microbial and insects attack on plants can bring changes in info-chemical frameworks and play a role in the food chain also. After insect herbivory and microbial pathogenesis, plants exhibit intense morpho-physiological and chemical reprogramming that leads to repellence/attraction of attacking organism or its natural enemy. The characterization of such interactions in different ecosystems is receiving due consideration, and underlying molecular and physiological mechanisms must be the point of concentration to unveil the evolution of multifaceted multitrophic interactions. Therefore, we have focused this phenomenon in a more realistic setting by integrating ecology and physiology to portray these multidimensional interfaces. We have shown, in this article, physiological trajectories in plant-microbe and insect relationship and their ecological relevance in nature. We focus and discuss microbial pathogenesis in plants, induced defense and the corresponding behavior of herbivore insects and vice-versa. It is hoped that this review will stimulate interest and zeal in microbes mediated plant-insect interactions along with their ecological consequences and encourage scientists to accept the challenges in this field.},

Commensurate with the increased frequency of cost-of-defense studies, the conventional wisdom that inducibility is a cost saving strategy is enjoying growing empirical support. However, there may be other advantages to inducibility that have yet to be confirmed. To identify them, I consider the disadvantages of high levels of constitutive defense in the context of herbivores differing in response to the defense and in the context of potential predators and parasitoids of herbivores. Among the potential benefits of inducibility are that it allows herbivore-specific targeting, reliable signaling to predators/parasitoids, avoidance of kairomonal use by specialist herbivores, and avoidance of adverse effects of direct defense on third trophic level organisms. Inducibility also enables local and systemic variation in defense responses. These factors may figure prominently in certain systems, but I predict that their quantification will prove to be a more daunting challenge than the quantifying of costs. Moreover, there may be constraints on the evolution of inducibility that limit the fine-tuning of responses necessary to realize many of these hypothetical benefits. Nevertheless, the growing body of detailed knowledge of the physiology of multiple induction pathways will provide opportunities for testing some of these hypotheses in different systems. Einhergehend mit der steigenden Zahl der Studien zu Kosten der pflanzlichen Abwehr bekommt die allgemeine Annahme, dass Induzierbarkeit von Abwehr eine kostensparende Strategie ist, immer mehr empirische Unterstützung. Aber vielleicht gibt es noch andere Vorteile der Induzierbarkeit als die, die bisher schon bestätigt werden konnten. Um solche, bisher noch nicht detektierten Vorteile herauszufinden, werde ich hier die Nachteile von starker konstitutiver Abwehr analysieren und dabei die unterschiedlichen Reaktionen von Herbivoren auf die pflanzliche Abwehr ebenso berücksichtigen wie potentielle Prädatoren und Parasitoide der Herbivoren. Die möglichen Vorteile von Induzierbarkeit sind u.a. folgende: gezielte, spezifische Abwehr gegen bestimmte Herbivoren, verlässliche Signalgebung an Prädatoren und Parasitoide, Vermeidung der Kairomonausnutzung durch spezialisierte Herbivore und Vermeidung von nachteiligen Effekten der direkten Abwehr auf die Organismen in der dritten trophischen Ebene. Induzierbarkeit ermöglicht auch lokale und systemische Variation bei Abwehrreaktionen. Diese Faktoren mögen in bestimmten Systemen eine herausragende Rolle spielen und dennoch prognostiziere ich, dass ihre Quantifizierung eine entmutigendere Aufgabe darstellen wird als die Quantifizierung der Kosten. Darüber hinaus könnten “constraints” bei der Evolution der Induzierbarkeit limitierend wirken auf die präzise, jeweils angriffsspezifische Feinabstimmung der Abwehrreaktionen, die aber notwendig ist, um die hypothetischen Vorteile zu realisieren. Dennoch können die wachsenden Kenntnisse zur Physiologie der multiplen Induktionswege uns Wege eröffnen, um einige der Hypothesen zu den Kosten der Induktion pflanzlicher Abwehr in verschiedenen Systemen zu testen.},

Plants do not endure herbivore attack passively but respond with a coordinated array of defensive strategies. Many toxic compounds and proteins elicited by herbivore attack are thought to increase the plant's resistance to future attack and thereby function as direct defenses. However, whether these compounds are actually responsible for induced direct defense remains unclear because the available evidence is largely correlative. Recent advances in understanding the genetic basis of resistance traits and their signaling pathways allow researchers to directly manipulate induced direct defenses and we review this growing literature. Also, these studies repeatedly demonstrate that changes in single traits rarely account for the phenomenon of induced defense. Transcriptional analysis performed during induction reveals the complexity of the metabolic reconfiguration in which direct defense traits are embedded. We conclude that genetic alterations of regulatory elements coordinating these complex changes will likely provide the most revealing manipulations and consider the controls necessary for a functional analysis of putative defense traits with transformed plants. Pflanzen erleiden Angriffe durch Herbivore nicht passiv, sondern reagieren mit einer Reihe koordinierter Verteidigungsstrategien. Für viele toxische Verbindungen und auch Proteine, die durch Herbivorenfraß induziert werden, nimmt man an, dass sie die pflanzliche Resistenz gegen weitere Angriffe erhöhen und somit als direkte Verteidigungsmaßnahme fungieren. Ob aber diese Verbindungen tatsächlich verantwortlich sind für eine direkte Abwehr, ist oft unklar, weil es dafür zumeist nur korrelative Anhaltspunkte gibt. Wir geben hier einen Überblick der in letzter Zeit erworbenen Erkenntnisse über die genetischen Grundlagen der pflanzlichen Resistenz und der entsprechenden Signalwege. Diese Informationen erlauben uns eine genetische Manipulation der induzierten direkten Abwehrreaktionen der Pflanzen. Die hier aufgezeigten Studien zeigen wieder einmal, dass Veränderungen einzelner Merkmale kaum als Erklärung für das Phänomen der induzierten Verteidigung dienen können. Transkriptionsanalysen, die während der Induktion in der Pflanze durchgeführt werden, offenbaren die Komplexität der Stoffwechselveränderungen, die bei Angriff durch Herbivore induziert werden. Genetische Veränderungen der regulatorischen Elemente, die diese komplexen Veränderungen koordinieren, bieten vermutlich die beste Möglichkeit der pflanzlichen Manipulation, um so die Grundlagen der Abwehrmechanismen zu verstehen, und die Kontrollen zu berücksichtigen, die für eine Funktionsanalyse der vermuteten pflanzlichen Abwehrmaßnahmen notwendig sind.},

Over the shorter term, they do this by the induction of de novo synthesis of a plethora of compounds; but invertebrates also affect the relative proportions of constitutively BVOCs-emitting plants. Thus, invertebrate–BVOCs interactions have potentially important implications for air quality and climate. Insect outbreaks are expected to increase with warmer climate, but quantitative understanding of BVOCs–invertebrate ecology, climate connections and atmospheric feedback remain as yet elusive. Examination of these interactions requires a description of outbreaks in ecosystem models, combined with quantitative observations on leaf and ecosystem level.

	abstract = {Trichoderma spp. are universal saprotrophic fungi in terrestrial ecosystems, and as rhizosphere inhabitants, they mediate interactions with other soil microorganisms, plants, and arthropods at multiple trophic levels. In the rhizosphere, Trichoderma can reduce the abundance of phytopathogenic microorganisms, which involves the action of potent inhibitory molecules, such as gliovirin and siderophores, whereas endophytic associations between Trichoderma and the seeds and roots of host plants can result in enhanced plant growth and crop productivity, as well as the alleviation of abiotic stress. Such beneficial effects are mediated via the activation of endogenous mechanisms controlled by phytohormones such as auxins and abscisic acid, as well as by alterations in host plant metabolism. During either root colonization or in the absence of physical contact, Trichoderma can trigger early defense responses mediated by Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species, and subsequently stimulate plant immunity by enhancing resistance mechanisms regulated by the phytohormones salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene. In addition, Trichoderma release volatile organic compounds and nitrogen or oxygen heterocyclic compounds that serve as signaling molecules, which have effects on plant growth, phytopathogen levels, herbivorous insects, and at the third trophic level, play roles in attracting the natural enemies (predators and parasitoids) of herbivores. In this paper, we review some of the most recent advances in our understanding of the environmental influences of Trichoderma spp., with particular emphasis on their multiple interactions at different trophic levels.},

	abstract = {The study of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in soil and other complex substrates is a rapidly developing field. VOCs in soils originate from a wide variety of biological sources; bacterial, fungal, mesofaunal, and plant. They are vital to inter- and intra-species interaction and soil health, and therefore offer a potential reactive, functional diagnostic tool to determine soil quality. The standard methodology for untargeted VOC profiling in environmental samples has been headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME), avoiding the need for solvent extraction procedures used in many biological soil tests. However, this technique can suffer from a lack of sensitivity due to competition between individual VOCs on the solid phases used for VOC recovery. Other common techniques used to monitor the VOC fingerprints from soils include high capacity sorptive extraction (HCSE). This study presents a novel SPME-trap-enrichment method using an automated, cryogen-free, focusing and pre-concentration trap method to reduce phase competition and increase sensitivity of analysis. This method was evaluated against single-SPME-trap and HCSE methods for sensitivity and number of compounds identified using a range of induced soil qualities (good, medium and poor). Results showed that SPME-trap-enrichment was able to identify 71\% and 7\% more compounds than single-SPME-trap and HCSE, respectively, using a software-based data processing approach, as well as increased total peak areas. The VOC profile was substantially affected by the extraction method used. The samples within the ‘poor’ treatment produced a larger number of aromatic, carboxylic acid and sulphur containing compound groups, while the ‘good’ and ‘medium’ groups were largely characterised by ketones and aldehydes. The potential ecological significance of the compounds identified were also explored. Of those tested, SPME-trap-enrichment represented the most robust and sensitive technique for VOC analysis, offering the potential to better elucidate the multifaceted interactions of VOCs within plant-microbial-soil systems.},

Induced responses to herbivores in plants are thought to be a form of adaptive phenotypic plasticity, whereby plants save metabolic costs by expressing defenses only when they are necessary. Although costs of being inducible have never been examined, there have been many studies of costs of induced responses, with approaches ranging from the manipulation of induction with herbivores or wounding, and more recently, with chemical elicitors. While some early studies reported no significant costs of induced responses, evidence for significant costs of induced responses in both wild and agricultural species has recently increased in the literature. Recent studies have made it clear that benefits of induced responses in the field in the presence of herbivores can counterbalance costs of induced responses seen in the absence of herbivores. Moreover, as has been shown for constitutive resistance, costs of induced responses may vary with environmental conditions, including the presence of competitors and altered resource availability. Ecological costs of induced responses may include increased susceptibility to untargeted herbivores, either through the altered attraction of specific herbivores or due to defense pathway cross-talk, but the actual fitness consequences of such ecological costs have been little studied. Mutant and transgenic plants altered in induced responses are increasingly being identified or produced, as are specific elicitors of direct and indirect defenses. Their use, coupled with the increasing ability to analyze global gene expression in plants, will advance studies on the specificity, magnitude, and mechanisms of costs of induced responses. Induzierte Antworten von Pflanzen auf Angriffe durch Herbivore werden als eine Form adaptiver phänotypischer Plastizität betrachtet, wobei Pflanzen metabolische Kosten sparen, wenn sie Abwehr nur dann mobilisieren, wenn sie auch wirklich benötigt wird. Während Kosten der Induzierbarkeit bisher nie untersucht wurden, gibt es viele Studien zu Kosten von induzierten Antworten. In diesen Studien wird Induktion durch Herbivore, mechanische Verwundung, oder durch chemische Elicitoren manipuliert. Während einige erste Studien keine signifikanten Kosten der induzierten pflanzlichen Antworten fanden, ergaben neuere Untersuchungen Anhaltspunkte für deutliche Kosten der Induktion sowohl bei Wild- wie auch bei Kulturpflanzen. Die neueren Studien zeigen deutlich, dass der Nutzen, der aus induzierten Antworten in Gegenwart von Herbivoren gezogen werden kann, die Kosten ausbalanciert, die in Abwesenheit von Herbivoren investiert werden. Ebenso wie konstitutive Resistenz kann auch die induzierte Antwort mit den verschiedenen Umweltfaktoren wie z.B. Konkurrenz und Nahrungsverfügbarkeit variieren. Die ökologischen Kosten induzierter Antworten können auch zu einer erhöhten Anfälligkeit gegenüber solchen spezialisierten Herbivoren führen, die durch die induzierte Antwort sogar angelockt werden. Weitere, allerdings bisher wenig untersuchte ökologische Kosten könnten dadurch entstehen, dass Wechselwirkungen zwischen induzierten Abwehr-Biogenesewegen auftreten. Pflanzenmutanten oder transgene Pflanzen mit veränderter induzierter Antwort werden mehr und mehr identifiziert oder produziert. Auch der Kenntnisstand über Elicitoren der direkten und indirekten Verteidigung erweitert sich zunehmend. Wenn genetisch veränderte Pflanzen genutzt werden und die Kenntnisse über die Elicitoren ebenso eingesetzt werden wie die Fähigkeit zur Analyse der Genexpression in Pflanzen, dann können die Untersuchungen zur Spezifität, zum Ausmaß, und den Mechanismen der Kosten von induzierten Antworten der Pflanzen auf Herbivorenbefall Fortschritte machen.},

Herein, genes encoding 61 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) were identified from the published genome and our previous A. glabripennis transcriptomic data. To investigate their physiological functions, we performed expression profiling of all AglaOBPs in the antennae, legs, and maxillary palps of both sexes. Phylogenetic analysis clustered A. glabripennis OBPs into four subgroups, comprising 29 Minus-C OBPs, 15 Antennae-binding proteins (ABPIIs), 10 Classic OBPs, and one Plus-C OBP. 12 AglaOBP genes were expressed specifically in antennae, and AglaOBP3, AglaOBP18, AglaOBP21, AglaOBP33, AglaOBP41, AglaOBP45, and AglaOBP47 were particularly highly expressed in male antennae. These proteins may function in the detection of female sex pheromones. AglaOBP23 and AglaOBP44 were preferentially expressed in maxillary palps. Expression profiling suggests that many OBPs may be involved in olfaction and gustation, in addition to carrying hydrophobic molecules. The AglaOBPs family has acquired functional diversity concurrently with functional constraints, and further investigation could provide insight into the roles of OBPs in chemoreception.},

Soil pests are at least equally dangerous to plant health and elicit plant defense mechanisms as well. Wireworms (Coleoptera: Elateridae) are common polyphagous soil pests of various crops, including economically relevant crops such as maize and potatoes. Their management with pesticides is often not successful or sustainable, and more research on biological alternatives is required. We aim at providing an overview of biological control methods under development or commercially available. Little is known about the natural enemies of wireworms, and the available work is often limited to laboratory experiments. The interest for using using microorganisms as biocontrol agent is increasing, and entomopathogenic fungi, nematodes, and bacteria represent promising alternatives to pesticides.

Common examples are salicin, salicortin, tremuloidin, and tremulacin, which accumulate to high concentrations in the leaves and bark of willows and poplars. Although their biosynthetic pathway is not known, recent work has suggested that benzyl benzoate may be a potential biosynthetic intermediate. Two candidate genes, named PtACT47 and PtACT49, encoding BAHD-type acyl transferases were identified and are predicted to produce such benzylated secondary metabolites. Herein described are the cDNA cloning, heterologous expression and in vitro functional characterization of these two BAHD acyltransferases. Recombinant PtACT47 exhibited low substrate selectivity and could utilize acetyl-CoA, benzoyl-CoA, and cinnamoyl-CoA as acyl donors with a variety of alcohols as acyl acceptors. This enzyme showed the greatest Km/Kcat ratio (45.8nM−1s−1) and lowest Km values (45.1μM) with benzoyl-CoA and salicyl alcohol, and was named benzoyl-CoA: salicyl alcohol O-benzoyltransferase (PtSABT). Recombinant PtACT49 utilized a narrower range of substrates, including benzoyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA and a limited number of alcohols. Its highest Km/Kcat (31.8nM−1s−1) and lowest Km (55.3μM) were observed for benzoyl-CoA and benzyl alcohol, and it was named benzoyl-CoA: benzyl alcohol O-benzoyltransferase (PtBEBT). Both enzymes were also capable of synthesizing plant volatile alcohol esters, such as hexenyl benzoate, at trace levels. Although the activities demonstrated are consistent with roles in salicinoid biosynthesis, direct tests of this hypothesis using transgenic poplar must still be performed.},

All in all, we think the amount of data on damage-induced plant-to-plant information transfer makes that the phenomenon can no longer be denied and deserves intensified attention by the scientific community. In this epilogue we highlight a couple of issues which received little attention and present some speculative ideas. First we concentrate on functional aspects of plant-plant communication we stress the concept of damage-induced signalling as an ecological cost to the signal-sending plant and we discuss the theoretical development on interplant signalling, which is still in its infancy. With respect to mechanisms, we compare above- to belowground signalling, discuss potential cues and stress the possibility that responses in signal-exposed plants may be hidden. Finally, we address some future prospects which may help in the further development of the still underexposed phenomenon of damage-induced plant-to-plant information transfer.},

The gustatory and olfactory systems of I. subelongatus play important roles in host location, mating, and feeding. In this study, we examined the types, distributions, and abundances of various sensilla associated with the mouthparts and antennae of I. subelongatus using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). On the mouthparts, five types of sensilla are present: sensilla trichodea (S.t.1–3), sensilla chaetica (S.c.1–3), sensilla basiconica (S.b.1–2), sensilla twig basiconica (S.tb.1–3), and sensilla placodea (S.p). S.t.3 are the most abundant sensilla subtype on the mouthparts in both sexes, while S.b.1 are the least abundant. Most sensilla on the mouthparts are located on the maxillae and labium, and the apex of each maxillary and labial palp carry the same sensilla subtypes (S.b.2 and S.tb.1–3). However, the total number of sensilla on the apex of each maxillary palp is higher than that on the labial palp. On the antennae, five types of sensilla are present: sensilla trichodea (S.t.1–3), sensilla chaetica (S.c.1–2), sensilla basiconica (S.b.1–3), Böhm bristles (B.b), and sensilla coeloconica (S.co). Antennal sensilla are mostly situated on the anterior surface of the antennal club, particularly on the two dense sensory bands. S.b.1 are the most abundant sensilla subtype on the antennae in both sexes, while S.t.1 are the least abundant. No sexual dimorphism in sensilla type or distribution on the mouthparts or antennae is observed between the sexes of I. subelongatus. However, S.t.3 (on mouthparts) and S.c.1 (on antennae) were significantly more abundant in males than in females, while more S.t.1 (on mouthparts) were observed in females than in males. Finally, the putative functions of each kind of sensilla with respect to their fine structures, distributions, and abundances on the mouthparts and antennae are discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Since their discovery about thirty years ago, induced plant responses have mainly been studied in interactions of plants with aboveground (AG) pathogens, herbivores and their natural enemies. Many induced responses, however, are known to be systemic and thus it is likely that responses induced by AG phytophages affect belowground (BG) phytophages feeding on the same plant, and vice versa. The awareness that interactions between AG and BG phytophages may be an important aspect in the evolution of induced responses came only recently and little research has been done to date. In this review we first summarise ecological studies that show how AG phytophages may affect BG phytophages, and vice versa. Then we focus on mechanisms governing interactions between AG and BG induced responses, such as cross-talk between signals. We chose the genus Nicotiana and the family Brassicaceae as two examples of plant groups that have been well studied for their induced responses both AG and BG – but not in concert – and explore how interactions between AG and BG induced compounds may link multitrophic interactions associated with these plants. We propose that future research on AG and BG interactions should focus on: 1). Identification of compounds and signalling pathways involved in AG and BG induced responses and analysis of their interaction mechanisms, 2). Evaluation of how induced responses affect interactions between BG and AG phytophages and their natural enemies, 3). Evaluation of the effects of AG and BG phytophages -in combination with their natural enemies- on plant fitness to identify keystone interactions that are driving the natural selection for induced responses in plants. Seit ihrer Entdeckung vor ca. dreißig Jahren werden induzierte pflanzliche Antworten der Pflanzen zumeist mit solchen Pathogenen, Herbivoren und deren natürlichen Feinden untersucht, die an oberirdischen Pflanzenteilen zu finden sind. Viele induzierte Antworten der Pflanzen können aber systemisch sein. Daher ist es wahrscheinlich, dass pflanzliche Antworten, die durch oberirdische Organismen induziert werden, auch solche Phytophagen beeinflussen, die unterirdisch an der Pflanze fressen, und umgekehrt. Das Bewußtsein darum, dass Interaktionen zwischen ober- und unterirdischen Phytophagen ein wichtiger Aspekt in der Evolution von induzierten pflanzlichen Abwehrreaktionen sein können, kam erst in neuerer Zeit auf. Deshalb gibt es bisher wenig Forschung auf diesem Gebiet. In diesem Überblick werden zunächst die Studien zusammengefasst, die den Einfluss oberirdischer Phytophager auf die unterirdischen Phytophagen zeigen und umgekehrt. Weiterhin wird auf die Mechanismen fokussiert, die Interaktionen zwischen ober- und unterirdisch fressenden Phytophagen steuern, wie z.B. Wechselwirkungen zwischen Signalen. Die Gattung Nicotiana und die Familie Brassicaceae werden als Modellpflanzen ausgewählt, an denen die induzierte Abwehr gegen entweder oberirdische oder unterirdische Phytophage – aber nicht gegen beide gleichzeitig – bereits gut untersucht wurde. Es wird analysiert, wie Interaktionen zwischen ober- und unterirdisch induzierten Verbindungen mit multitrophischen Interaktionen dieser Pflanzen in Zusammenhang stehen. Es werden Vorschläge unterbreitet, worauf zukünftige Forschung an ober- und unterirdisch induzierten Interaktionen fokussieren sollte: (1) Identifizierung der Verbindungen und der Signalwege, die bei ober- und unterirdischer Induktion von Bedeutung sind und Analyse der Interaktionsmechanismen, (2) Untersuchung der Frage, wie induzierte Reaktionen der Pflanze sich auf Interaktionen zwischen ober- und unterirdischen Phytophagen und deren natürlichen Feinden auswirken, (3) Analyse der Auswirkungen der Effekte von ober- und unterirdisch fressenden Phytophagen unter Berücksichtigung auch ihrer natürlichen Feinde auf die pflanzliche Fitness, um solche Schlüsselinteraktionen zu identifizieren, die entscheidend sind für die Selektion der induzierten pflanzlichen Reaktion auf Angriffe durch Phytophage.},

	abstract = {Insects gain a great deal of information about the environment through small molecules that carry signals (semiochemicals) from the same or different species. Typically, these compounds are hydrophobic molecules, and the receptors that they activate are immersed in an aqueous environment in multiple sensilla in antennae, maxillary palps, or proboscis. Evidence showing that odorant-binding proteins solubilize and transport these semiochemicals to the neurons housing the receptors is growing. At this peripheral level, information is processed by a hybrid of combinatorial coding and labeled lines, i.e., dedicated circuits with highly tuned receptors. Odorant receptors (ORs) are very diverse, but they form ion channels with a well-conserved coreceptor named Orco, which also forms ion channels per se. Both ORs and Orco are serpentine proteins with N-terminus in, C-terminus out topology. The structure of a homomeric Orco was recently resolved by cryo-electron microscopy and shows that ion channels are formed by the C-terminus membrane segment of each subunit of a tetramer. The pore seems to be closed at the extracellular environment by hydrophobic residues. The other transmembrane segments contribute to some degree to a ligand-binding pocket, which might be analogous in yet-to-be-determined OR/Orco complexes. Intriguingly, a mosquito receptor, CquiOR/CquiOrco, is activated by some semiochemicals and inhibited by others. When this receptor was coexpressed with native receptors from the vinegar fly, the inhibitory response generated by CquiOR32 attenuated the excitatory responses of the fly's DmelOR7a, thus suggesting a mechanism of intraneuron inhibition. Elucidating the structure of OR/Orco complexes and this inhibitory mechanism are exciting future research avenues.},

Today, with accumulated knowledge of their sequences and function, many insights have been gained. We are however still far from understanding how these receptors became fine-tuned to intraspecific signals and the specific genetic and evolutionary changes that led to their divergence. This chapter relates the advances made in odorant and pheromone receptor identification in Lepidoptera in the context of the “omic” era, describes the different approaches developed for their functional studies, and summarizes how comparative studies shed light on their possible evolution.},

Insect communication is mainly based on chemosensation due to the small body size of insects, which limits their ability to produce or perceive auditory and visual signals, especially over large distances. Chemicals involved in insect communication are called semiochemicals. These volatiles and semivolatiles compounds allow to Insects to find a mate, besides the oviposition site in reproduction and food sources. Actually, insect olfaction mechanism is subject to study, but systematic analyses of the role of neural membranes are scarce. In the present work we evaluated the interactions of α-pinene, benzaldehyde, eugenol, and grandlure, among others, with a lipid membrane model using surface pressure experiments and Monte Carlo computational analysis.

Already, a number of secondary metabolite defence compounds are known for which the pathways are conveniently clustered genomically, e.g. the benzoxazinoids (hydroxamic acids) and the avenacins. For the former, it is shown that the small molecular weight lipophilic activator cis-jasmone can induce production of these compounds and certain genes within the pathway. Numerous groups around the world work on inducible defence systems. The science is rapidly expanding and involves studying the interacting components of defence pathways and the switching mechanisms activated by small molecular weight lipophilic compounds.

However, to develop such strategies, a better understanding of the molecular basis of plant-pest interactions is still needed. Despite decades of research investigating plant-insect interactions, few examples exist where underlying molecular mechanisms are well characterized, and even rarer are cases where this knowledge has been successfully applied to manage harmful agricultural pests. Consequently, the field appears to be static, urgently needing shifts in approaches to identify novel mechanisms by which insects colonize plants and plants avoid insect pressure. In this perspective, we outline necessary steps for advancing holistic methodologies that capture complex plant-insect molecular interactions. We highlight novel and underexploited approaches in plant-insect interaction research as essential routes to translate knowledge of underlying molecular mechanisms into durable pest control strategies, including embracing microbial partnerships, identifying what makes a plant an unsuitable host, capitalizing on tolerance of insect damage, and learning from cases where crop domestication and agronomic practices enhance pest virulence.},

All organisms, whether they are dead or alive, release certain chemicals into their environment. These can be used as infochemicals by any other individual in the food web that has the biological machinery to sense and process such information. Such machinery has evolved in bacteria, plants and animals and has thus become an inextricable part of the mechanisms that underlie feeding relations in food webs. Organisms live in environments suffused with infochemicals and this information network can be tapped into by both predators and their prey. However, it also opens doors to confusion in the face of a bewildering abundance and complexity of information. Infochemical mixing, masking, crypsis and mimicry could cause such confusion, especially in species-rich communities. We provide a point of entry into this field of enquiry by identifying seminal papers and major reviews and by discussing research lines that might enhance our mechanistic understanding of interactions in food webs. We highlight empirical work on the ways in which individuals use infochemicals and discuss model results on how this mediates patterns of population dynamics.

	abstract = {Chemical signals emitted by plants are crucial to understand the ecology and evolution of plant–animal interactions. Scent is an important component of floral phenotype and represents a decisive communication channel between plants and floral visitors. Floral volatiles promote attraction of mutualistic pollinators and, in some cases, serve to prevent flower visitation by antagonists such as ants. Despite ant visits to flowers have been suggested to be detrimental to plant fitness, in recent years there has been a growing recognition of the positive role of ants in pollination. Nevertheless, the question of whether floral volatiles mediate mutualisms between ants and ant-pollinated plants still remains largely unexplored. Here we review the documented cases of ant pollination and investigate the chemical composition of the floral scent in the ant-pollinated plant Cytinus hypocistis. By using chemical-electrophysiological analyses and field behavioural assays, we examine the importance of olfactory cues for ants, identify compounds that stimulate antennal responses, and evaluate whether these compounds elicit behavioural responses. Our findings reveal that floral scent plays a crucial role in this mutualistic ant–flower interaction, and that only ant species that provide pollination services and not others occurring in the habitat are efficiently attracted by floral volatiles. 4-oxoisophorone, (E)-cinnamaldehyde, and (E)-cinnamyl alcohol were the most abundant compounds in Cytinus flowers, and ant antennae responded to all of them. Four ant pollinator species were significantly attracted to volatiles emitted by Cytinus inflorescences as well as to synthetic mixtures and single antennal-active compounds. The small amount of available data so far suggest that there is broad interspecific variation in floral scent composition among ant-pollinated plants, which could reflect differential responses and olfactory preferences among different ant species. Many exciting discoveries will be made as we enter into further research on chemical communication between ants and plants.},

Deprivation from a resource will normally make them more responsive to it or to perform behaviour increasing the probability of encountering such a resource. Modulation of the olfactory system has been shown mainly in the central nervous system, but also in the periphery. In this study, antennal sensitivity of females of the Egyptian cotton leaf worm Spodoptera littoralis to different plant and sex pheromone odours was measured using electroantennography (EAG). Different mating status, age, and feeding status were used to investigate peripheral changes in olfactory responses. Virgin females were found to be more sensitive to plant odours and sex pheromone compared to mated females. Age also had an impact on antennal sensitivity, 2 and 4 days old females being more sensitive than just-emerged ones. Such an increase in sensitivity could be explained by maturation of olfactory receptor neurons after emergence or by an increase in motivation as the available expected life time remaining decreases. Finally, feeding status did not modify the antennal sensitivity of females. A peripheral modulation could thus be demonstrated in the olfactory system of female Spodoptera littoralis at certain life stages.},

E-O3 increased the values of the Shannon (43–80\%) and Simpson (34–51\%) indexes of the phyllo-and endo-spheric bacterial communities in NG5055. E-O3 also increased the values of the phyllosphere Simpson index by 58\% and the endosphere Shannon index by 54\% in WYJ27. Both diversity indexes positively correlated with the contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium, and soluble sugar, and negatively correlated with the contents of starch and condensed tannins. The leaf-associated bacterial community composition significantly changed in both rice cultivars under E-O3. Moreover, the leaf-associated bacterial communities in NG5055 were more sensitive to E-O3 than those in WYJ27. The chemical properties explained 70\% and 98\% of variations in the phyllosphere and endosphere bacterial communities, respectively, suggesting a predominant role of chemical status for the endospheric bacterial community. Most variation (57.3\%) in the endosphere bacterial community assembly was explained by phosphorus. Gammaproteobacteria and Pantoea were found to be the most abundant class (63–76\%) and genus (38–48\%) in the phyllosphere and endosphere, respectively. E-O3 significantly increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in the phyllosphere bacterial community and decreased the relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria in the endophytic community. In conclusion, elevated O3 increased the diversity of bacterial communities of leaf phyllosphere and endosphere, and leaf chemical properties had a more pronounced effect on the endosphere bacterial community.},

In parallel, we review neurophysiological studies that show the importance of blend composition and background in modifying the representation of floral blends in the pollinator brain, as well as experience-dependent plasticity in increasing the representation of a rewarding odor. Here, we suggest that the efficacy of the floral blend in different environments may be an important selective force shaping differences in pollinator olfactory receptor expression and underlying neural mechanisms that mediate flower visitation and plant reproductive isolation.},

Some of these OS components might elicit a defense response to combat insect attacks (elicitors), while some might curb the plant defenses (suppressors). Few reports suggest that the synthesis and function of OS components might depend on the host plant and associated microorganisms. We review these intricate plant-insect interactions, during which there is a continuous exchange of molecules between plants and feeding insects along with the associated microorganisms. We further provide a list of commonly identified inducible plant produced defensive molecules released upon insect attack as well as in response to OS treatments of the plants.

Beetles contend with these challenges by using multiple, integrated sensory modalities, and sequential decision making. They incorporate both negative and positive information at multiple scales to locate susceptible hosts across large and heterogeneous landscapes. Some of the olfactory sensory neurons that convey non-host signals are relatively broadly tuned, whereas those that underlie intraspecific communication and host quality assessment are more specific, an arrangement that maximizes the use of antennal space while retaining high fidelity of detection channels strongly linked to survival and reproduction. The pertinent co-localization of neurons within sensilla provides the means for odour mixture processing in the periphery and enhances odour source discrimination and evaluation of chemical ratios in host tissue. Bark beetles show high behavioural plasticity in their orientation sequences, which allows them to adjust to environmental variability. This plasticity is modulated by environmental, genetic, and gene×environment drivers. Behavioural plasticity allows individuals to best realize the benefits that can be derived from pheromone-mediated cooperative attacks when populations are high. Cross-scale linkages among neurons, sensilla, orientation sequences, populations, and habitat structure underlie the landscape-scale environmental and socioeconomic impacts bark beetles exert. They also underlie rapid outbreaks in response to human-induced environmental alterations, such as climate change, habitat manipulation, and global transport.},

Plants are under continuous threat of being challenged by herbivorous insects and pathogenic micro-organisms. How plants respond to multiple antagonists that may co-occur has been investigated by researchers on the ecological, pharmacological, and genetic level. In this review we focus on recent studies of ecological cross-effects between phyllophagous herbivores and phytopathogenic fungi. Interactions between the two types of plant antagonists may be direct, plant-mediated or both. We present studies which describe a) potentially plant-mediated cross-effects but where direct effects cannot be excluded (‘direct/plant-mediated effects’), b) plant-mediated cross-effects that are confined to the attacked plant part (‘locally plant-mediated effects’) and c) plant-mediated cross-effects on a systemic scale (‘systemic effects’). Also, studies are addressed which attempted to directly link plant physiological changes induced by the herbivore and fungal attack with effects on the antagonists. Special attention will be given to spatial and temporal aspects of plant fungal infection and herbivore infestation. Pflanzen werden oft gleichzeitig von herbivoren Insekten und phytopathogenen Mikroorgansimen bedroht. Die Reaktion der Pflanze auf verschiedene, gleichzeitig auftretende Antagonisten wurde schon vielfach unter ökologischen, chemischen und molekularen Aspekten untersucht. Diese Übersicht konzentriert sich auf ökologische Wechselwirkungen zwischen phyllophagen Herbivoren und phytopathogenen Pilzen. Wechselwirkungen zwischen diesen beiden Antagonistentypen können ganz direkt sein, oder durch die Pflanze vermittelt werden, oder beides. Es werden Studien berücksichtigt, die folgende Formen der Wechselwirkungen analysieren: (a) potentiell pflanzenvermittelte Effekte, wobei aber direkte Interaktionen nicht ausgeschlossen werden können (“direkte/pflanzenvermittelte Wechselwirkung”), (b) pflanzenvermittelte Effekte, die auf den unmittelbar angegriffenen Pflanzenteil beschränkt sind (“lokale pflanzenvermittelte Wechselwirkung”), (c) pflanzenvermittelte systemische Wechselwirkungen (“systemische Effekte”). Weiterhin werden solche Studien in den Überblick einbezogen, die einen Zusammenhang suchen zwischen induzierten physiologischen Veränderungen der Pflanze nach Angriff durch Herbivore oder Pilze und den Auswirkungen dieser Veränderungen auf die Antagonisten. Besondere Aufmerksamkeit wird den räumlichen und zeitlichen Aspekten der Induktion von Abwehrmaßnahmen durch Herbivorenfraß und Pilzbefall an einer Pflanze gewidmet.},

Behaviourally active pheromone, and kairomone (host and sympatric bark beetle pheromone) odours were tested alongside smoke compounds released by burnt wood that are potentially attractive to the insect. The antennae bore several types of sensilla. Two plate areas in the proximal and distal ends of each antennal segment were covered with basiconic sensilla that responded to the odour stimuli. Sensilla basiconica contained one or two cells of different spike amplitude. The 32 male and 38 female ORNs tested responded with excitations or inhibitions to the different plant odours. In general the response of male and female receptors was very similar so they were pooled to perform a cluster analysis on ORN responses. Six ORNs were clearly specialised for pheromone reception. Responses to kairomone and smoke odours were less specific than those of pheromone, but a group of 9 cells was clearly excited by smoke compounds (mainly eugenol and 4-methyl 2-methoxyphenol), a group of 8 cells was very responsive to α-pinene, β-pinene and cis-verbenol, and a group of 14 cells responded to a wider range of compounds. The rest of the cells (47\%) were either non-responsive or slightly inhibited by smoke compounds. Dose–response curves were obtained for several compounds. Different compounds induced significantly different latencies and these appeared to be unrelated to their boiling point.},

Fitting is often based on the ecophysiological equivalence of an organism to biotic and/or abiotic parameters in its old and new habitats. Strong equivalence in these parameters based on extant phenotypic traits possessed by the organism at a specified starting point may allow an organism to colonize a novel habitat. More complex forms of fitting may include multiple parties, such as those involving the attraction of new pollinators to an assemblage of flowers. Some of the most conspicuous examples of fitting involve invasive species. Invasiveness may occur when an organism disproportionately escapes from coevolved enemies and/or attracts more mutualists in its new range compared with its native range. Some species may be better at fitting to novel conditions than others; based on how refined their evolved traits are to their native habitats.},

	abstract = {Floral scent is an important vehicle of communication between plants and their pollinators. In an obligate mutualism between fig and fig wasps, the chemical regulation plays a crucial role in their encounter. Pollinating wasps mainly rely on their olfactory sensation to the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by their host plants to localize their hosts. In this study, we collected the VOCs from male and female figs of Ficus pumila var. pumila by in vivo dynamic headspace adsorption (VDHA) before and after pollination, and analyzed the VOCs using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). We examined the Wiebesia pumilae pollinators' behavior in response to the VOCs at different developmental phases in Y-tube experiments. The results: (1) The fig volatiles of F. pumila var. pumila contained a variety of compounds, in which Linalool appears to be the dominant one to pollinating wasps, suggesting that Linalool may be used for the long-range localization while the short-range localization may rely on the chemical profile containing specific compositions and concentrations. (2) Although the quality and quantity of VOCs were different between receptive male and female syconia, they shared a few compounds which account for {\textgreater}50\% of total volatiles. In addition, the proportion of the three classes of compounds including terpenes, benzenoids, and fatty acid derivatives was similar, suggesting that a simulating interaction occurs between the VOCs of receptive male and female syconia. Furthermore, the Y-tube experiments showed no preference of pollinating wasps to the male and female syconia. Therefore a pollinator is unlikely to discriminate male and female figs via the VOC variations. (3) The VOCs of syconia were changed after pollination or oviposition, with some compounds decreased (e.g. Linalool) or even disappeared, while some increased (e.g. Longifolene) or new compounds formed. In terms of the chemical composition, terpenes and fatty acid derivatives are decreased, while benzenoids are increased, and nitrogens arisen. The results derived from Y-tube experiments showed that the VOCs of receptive male and female figs played a very significant role in attracting pollinating wasps. In contrast, the fig volatiles of inter-floral phase (5days after pollination or oviposition) were significantly repellent to the wasps. Figs may thus express their flower developmental and pollinating or ovipositing status by changing their VOC quantity and composition in order for pollinating wasps to receive the chemical signals, choose the right hosts, and recognize the right developmental phases of their hosts.},

	abstract = {Climate models predict drier conditions in the next decades in the Mediterranean basin. Given the importance of soil CO2 efflux in the global carbon balance and the important role of soil monoterpene and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in soil ecology, we aimed to study the effects of the predicted drought on soil CO2, monoterpenes and other VOC exchange rates and their seasonal and interannual variations. We decreased soil water availability in a Mediterranean holm oak forest soil by means of an experimental drought system performed since 1999 to the present. Measurements of soil gas exchange were carried out with IRGA, GC and PTR-MS techniques during two annual campaigns of contrasting precipitation. Soil respiration was twice higher the wet year than the dry year (2.27±0.26 and 1.05±0.15, respectively), and varied seasonally from 3.76±0.85μmolm−2s−1 in spring, to 0.13±0.01μmolm−2s−1 in summer. These results highlight the strong interannual and interseasonal variation in CO2 efflux in Mediterranean ecosystems. The drought treatment produced a significant soil respiration reduction in drought plots in the wet sampling period. This reduction was even higher in wet springs (43\% average reduction). These results show (1) that soil moisture is the main factor driving seasonal and interannual variations in soil respiration and (2) that the response of soil respiration to increased temperature is constrained by soil moisture. The results also show an additional control of soil CO2 efflux by physiology and phenology of trees and animals. Soil monoterpene exchange rates ranged from −0.01 to 0.004nmolm−2s−1, thus the contribution of this Mediterranean holm oak forest soil to the total monoterpenes atmospheric budget seems to be very low. Responses of individual monoterpenes and VOCs to the drought treatment were different depending on the compound. This suggests that the effect of soil moisture reduction in the monoterpenes and VOC exchange rates seems to be dependent on monoterpene and VOC type. In general, soil monoterpene and other VOC exchange rates were not correlated with soil CO2 efflux. In all cases, only a low proportion of variance was explained by the soil moisture changes, since almost all VOCs increased their emission rates in summer 2005, probably due to the effect of high soil temperature. Results indicate thus that physical and biological processes in soil are controlling soil VOC exchange but further research is needed on how these factors interact to produce the observed VOCs exchange responses.},

	abstract = {The lepidopteran species Automeris liberia from the Saturniidae family is a polyphagous insect responsible for defoliating plants, such as the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jaquim). The antennae of insects play an important role in survival in various environments. Antennae are the main olfactory and sensory organs of insects and have different sensilla to detect chemical cues, movement, humidity and temperature. The olfactory structures present in the antennae are responsible for certain insect behavior, which is influenced by chemical communication. The morphology, distribution and location of the sensilla in the antennae of male and female A. liberia were investigated by scanning electron microscopy to understand the olfactory mechanisms relevant to insect-insect communication and insect-plant communication, among others. The results showed that the flagellum, scape and pedicel length and the number of antennomeres differed between the sexes and demonstrating the existence of sexual dimorphism in the antennae males (bipectinate) and females (filiform). According to the morphological data, seven types of sensilla were identified along the surface of the antennae, classified as trichodea, chaetica, basiconica, coeloconica, squamiformia, styloconica and Böhm's bristles. Among the sensilla chaetica, basiconica and Böhm's bristles, two subtypes based on length were identified in both sexes. The sensilla trichodea exhibited dimorphism since three subtypes were observed in males, while in females, only one subtype was observed, according to the length of the sensilla. Sensilla trichodea subtypes I and II were specific to males, while subtype III was observed in both sexes. These types of sensilla are involved in the recognition of pheromone molecules. Therefore, morphological study of the localization of the sensilla in the antennae will provide useful and relevant results for electrophysiological studies and behavioral tests. This information can help to understand the chemical communication of insects and helps in research directed strategies for pest control.},

Parasitoids have evolved strategies to locate their host, but this can be affected by risk of intraguild predation or hyperparasitism.

To understand the mechanisms behind the emergence of herbivory and subsequent species radiations of insects driven largely by diet specialization, it is important to identify the molecular basis associated with these evolutionary transitions. However, most herbivore species lack the genomic information and genetic tools required to identify functionally important genes. The notable exception is the genus Drosophila in which herbivory evolved at least three times independently, and for which abundant genomic data are available. Furthermore, contained within the family Drosophilidae is Drosophila melanogaster, the first genetic model animal. Here, we provide a synthesis of the salient tools that the D. melanogaster system provides to identify functionally important genes required for herbivory and subsequent diet specialization across insects.},

	abstract = {Iterative equations were developed that predict the encounter rate between a population of moving animals and a population of stationary objects, where the animals cease to search upon finding an object. The encounter rate through time depends on the number of searching animals (bark beetles), number of stationary objects (host trees), average speed of the animals, average radius of the object, and area of the search arena. The iterative equations were used in a computer program to vary these parameters with regard to flight dispersal of the bark beetle Ips typographus (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) during their search for susceptible host trees of Norway spruce (Picea abies). Realistic parameters of flight speed, numbers of beetles and susceptible host trees, tree diameters, density of healthy trees, search area, and time searching were held constant while certain of these parameters were varied in computer model runs. In most cases, significant proportions of the modeled bark beetle population (of which individuals fly forward with a random component) found the relatively few susceptible host trees suitable for colonization. Only at very low effective flight speeds (due to longer stays on trees) or with widely distributed hosts of smaller diameter, did relatively few beetles find suitable hosts. Once the ‘pioneer’ beetles find susceptible hosts, release of aggregation pheromone would greatly increase the effective radius of the host and allow rapid concentration of the population on these trees. The model suggests that primary attraction to host tree volatiles is not mandatory for host finding and selection in many species of bark beetle. Evolution of an olfactory response to host volatiles is more probable in species with low population densities or widely dispersed host plants, or both. Also, there would be little selection pressure on a bark beetle species to evolve aggregation pheromones if they can respond over some meters to plant volatiles that reveal the location of a susceptible host.},

	abstract = {Insects perceive dangerous or attractive chemicals in the environment (such as the presence of predators, food or mates) through their olfaction and gustation. This leads to host searching, mate finding and other behaviors that are critical for insect survival. These vital activities are mediated by many chemosensory receptor proteins, including odorant receptors (ORs), gustatory receptors (GRs) and ionotropic receptors (IRs). Trichogramma japonicum Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) is a commonly used egg parasitoid for controlling lepidopteran pests in rice fields. To reveal the roles of its olfactory and gustatory systems in biological control, we systematically analyzed major chemosensory receptor genes from T. japonicum. Through transcriptomic analyses of male and female heads, we found that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly related to chemosensory functions, and there were more chemosensory-related genes expressed in female heads than male heads, which may be related to the need for females to search for their hosts or sense male pheromone. Furthermore, we identified 66 chemosensory receptor genes, including 51 ORs, seven IRs and eight GRs, that were most closely relate to those of other hymenopteran species according to the results of both Blast best-hit and phylogenetic analyses. The tissue expression profile showed that 65 of the 66 chemosensory receptors were highly expressed in the heads, suggesting their putative roles in olfaction and gustation. In addition, the sex-specific expression patterns suggested their potential functions in host-seeking or mate sensing behaviors. This study may provide base for further understanding the olfactory and gustatory systems of T. japonicum and increasing its efficiency in pest control in the future.},

We make the case that IPM is not explicitly ‘pollinator friendly’, but rather must be adapted to reduce impacts on pollinators and to facilitate synergies between crop pollination and pest control practices and ecosystem services. To reconcile these diverse needs, we introduce a systematic framework for ‘integrated pest and pollinator management’ (IPPM). We also highlight novel tools to unify monitoring and economic decision-making processes for IPPM and outline key policy actions and knowledge gaps. We propose that IPPM is needed to promote more coordinated, ecosystem-based strategies for sustainable food production, against the backdrop of increasing pesticide regulation and pollinator dependency in agriculture.

Currently, monitoring and control methods of L. botrana are based on its main sex pheromone component, being effective for low population densities. In order to improve control methods, antennal olfactory proteins in moths, such as odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and odorant receptors (ORs) have been studied as promising targets for the discovery of new potent semiochemicals, which have not been reported for L. botrana. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the repertoire of proteins related to chemoreception in L. botrana by antennal transcriptome and analyze the relative expression of OBPs and CSPs in male and female antennae. Through next-generation sequencing of the antennal transcriptome by Ilumina HiSeq2500 we identified a total of 118 chemoreceptors, from which 61, 42 and 15 transcripts are related to ORs, ionotropic receptors (IRs) and gustatory receptors (GRs), respectively. Furthermore, RNA-Seq data revealed 35 transcripts for OBPs and 18 for chemosensory proteins (CSPs). Analysis by qRT-PCR showed 20 OBPs significantly expressed in female antennae, while 5 were more expressed in males. Similarly, most of the CSPs were significantly expressed in female than male antennae. All the olfactory-related sequences were compared with homologs and their phylogenetic relationships elucidated.

Among the several signaling molecules involved, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intracellular calcium signatures belong to early events, which are responsible for most of the ensuing cascades of chemical and molecular reactions. In this review, we will focus on rapid early events following insect feeding on plants that eventually lead to the production and release of phytochemicals. Furthermore, we compare and discuss the impact of mechanical and biotroph wounding.},

	abstract = {Summary
In nature, plant-insect interactions occur in complex settings involving multiple trophic levels, often with multiple species at each level.1 Herbivore attack of a host plant typically dramatically alters the plant’s odor emission in terms of concentration and composition.2,3 Therefore, a well-adapted herbivore should be able to predict whether a plant is still suitable as a host by judging these changes in the emitted bouquet. Although studies have demonstrated that oviposition preferences of successive insects were affected by previous infestations,4,5 the underlying molecular and olfactory mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report that tobacco hawkmoths (Manduca sexta) preferentially oviposit on Jimson weed (Datura wrightii) that is already infested by a specialist, the three-lined potato beetle (Lema daturaphila). Interestingly, the moths’ offspring do not benefit directly, as larvae develop more slowly when feeding together with Lema beetles. However, one of M. sexta’s main enemies, the parasitoid wasp Cotesia congregata, prefers the headspace of M. sexta-infested plants to that of plants infested by both herbivores. Hence, we conclude that female M. sexta ignore the interspecific competition with beetles and oviposit deliberately on beetle-infested plants to provide their offspring with an enemy-reduced space, thus providing a trade-off that generates a net benefit to the survival and fitness of the subsequent generation. We identify that α-copaene, emitted by beetle-infested Datura, plays a role in this preference. By performing heterologous expression and single-sensillum recordings, we show that odorant receptor (Or35) is involved in α-copaene detection.},

	abstract = {Chemical signals are important cues throughout the life of an insect especially for mate location and for prey and host finding. The chemical signal, whether pheromone or plant volatile organic compound (VOC), remains specific because of the mixture, of the ratio of the components in mixture and of the release quantity. The plasticity of pheromone emissions is now studied in several insect species in relation to geographic variation, host plant specialization and chemical and light environment. The actual vision is that the pheromone composition is likely to be more plastic than previously assumed. The perception of the environmental odorscape produced by living plants and animals together addressed the question on the specific detection of the pheromone signal in the atmospheric blend of molecules. In agrobiocoenosis, the cultivated plants produce a specific odorscape. The insects rely on plant VOCs to locate the crop or the host plant, after which specific mixtures act as oviposition stimulants. The insect responses to host plants and their odours vary with the physiological status of both actors: the plant and the insect. Chemical signals released by plants vary with plant physiology, diel periodicity, climatic factors and pollution, and these signals can be species or even variety specific. Many of plants signalling compounds detected by insects have important roles as warning signals, which can also function in plant–plant communication.},

The comparison of different parameters of the EAG responses, i.e. peak, rise and decay, reveals that peripheral olfactory perception of most volatiles is not significantly different between these two forms.

	abstract = {Fungal infection of plants alters plant metabolism and therefore their chemistry, by either increasing levels of defence compounds or decreasing levels of nutrients. Such alterations in plants, in turn, influence the performance of the insects that feed on them. Pathogenic fungi live on plants as either biotrophs or necrotrophs. Both bio- and necrotrophic fungi alter the physiologies of plants in distinctly different pathways. This article explores the patterns of relationships evident between insects and plants, the latter infected by biotrophic and necrotrophic fungi, using established examples from the vertically and horizontally transmitted biotrophic, endophytic fungi. A curious pattern evident in such interactions refers to the biotrophic, endophytic fungi that live in galls induced by the Cecidomyiidae (Diptera). The insects associated with necrotrophic fungi stand distinct from the patterns of interactions evident among insects, plants, and fungi. An understanding of the ecology of three-way interactions involving distantly related organisms, viz., insects, fungi, and plants, will bear long-term consequences in the better management of annual crop and perennial forest trees. A majority of previously published papers in the context of insect–plant–fungus interactions liberally use the terms ‘mutualism’ and ‘symbiosis’, implicating the various benefits conferred on one or more of the participants. In the examples referred to, and the interacting contexts analyzed in this paper, what emerges is that the fungus is parasitically associated with the plant. In the eventuality of an insect interacting with the infected (= parasitized) plant, the insect gains (e.g., gall-inducing Cecidomyiidae) or in occasional instances the plant gains (e.g., Epichloë infections of Poaceae). A unifying model for insect–plant–fungus interacting systems is not readily apparent. The only possible explanation is the independent origins of insect behaviour in either preferring or rejecting the fungus-infected plants. This is possibly driven by specific environmental conditions, in which a specific fungus–plant–insect system would be operating.},

Therefore, tea plants have generated a series of mechanisms in response to the two stimuli related to E. oblique feeding: mechanical damage and oral secretion stimuli. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the responses to these distinct inducers, we employed RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) to compare three genome-wide expression profiles of a mechanically damaged plant, geometrid-damaged plant and undamaged control. Using the Illumina sequencing platform, we obtained approximately 304.54 million reads in total. These reads were assembled into 65,548 unigenes with an average length of 602bp and an N50 of 860bp. By comparing the profiles between the mechanically damaged plant and undamaged control, geometrid-damaged plant and undamaged control and geometrid-damaged plant and mechanically damaged plant, 33,418, 27,029 and 28,260 differentially expressed unigenes were identified, respectively. A comparison of the transcriptomes of the geometrid-damaged and mechanically damaged plants showed that 2995 unigenes were induced only by oral secretion stimuli. These unigenes exhibited significant differences in expression for the jasmonate/ethylene signaling and brassinosteroid pathways, terpenoid synthesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, which are involved in defense against insect pests. Finally, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was used to verify the expression of preferentially expressed unigenes in the geometrid-damaged plant compared with that of the mechanically damaged plant as predicted by RNA-Seq. Our research yielded novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of pest resistance in tea plants and determined numerous genes and pathways that are involved in these processes. In addition, the expressed sequences were compiled to provide a valuable resource for the study of tea plant resistance to pests.},

However, little is known about the host-selection behavior and the respective intrinsic mechanism of sap-sucking insects in response to elevated CO2. In this experiment, the host-selection behavior, as well as the physiological mechanism based on the analysis of growth, development and energy substances, and the expression of the olfactory-related genes of the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, were studied under ambient (407.0 ± 4.3 μl/L) and elevated (810.5 ± 7.2 μl/L) CO2. The results indicated that the aphids reared under ambient and elevated CO2 did not differ in their level of preference for cotton seedlings, whatever the CO2 conditions in which the plants developed. However, aphids reared under elevated CO2 showed a greater ability to respond to the plant volatiles compared to aphids that developed under ambient CO2 (+23.3\%). This suggests that rising atmospheric CO2 enhances the activity of host selection in this aphid. Compared with ambient CO2, elevated CO2 significantly increased aphid body weight (+36.7\%) and the contents of glycogen (+18.9\%), body fat (+14.6\%), and amino acids (+16.8\%) and increased the expression of odor-binding protein genes, OBP2 (+299.6\%) and OBP7 (+47.4\%), and chemosensory protein genes, CSP4 (+265.3\%) and CSP6 (+50.9\%), potentially enhancing the overall life activities and upregulating the olfactory ability of A. gossypii. We speculated that the rising atmospheric CO2 level would likely aggravate the damage caused by A. gossypii due to the higher potential host selection and increased general activity under future climate change.},

	abstract = {Several molecular steps are involved in odorant detection within insect olfactory sensilla, including various proteins that could interfere with ligand-receptor interaction, either before or after ligand binding. Among these “perireceptor events”, the step of signal termination is crucial to sustain the kinetics of the olfactory response. Antennal enzymes called Odorant-Degrading Enzymes (ODEs) present in the vicinity of receptors may participate in signal inactivation by rapid degradation of odorant molecules into inactive compounds, i.e. compounds that would no longer be able to activate receptors. These enzymes are also proposed to degrade excess of odorant chemicals in the sensilla in order to avoid overstimulation of the receptors, thus contributing to olfactory sensitivity and background noise reduction. ODEs could also take part in the general catabolism of odorant molecules within the sensilla, allowing chemicals to be removed from the olfactory hairs and protecting olfactory neurons from possible harmful molecules. Despite this wide range of possible roles, few antennal enzymes have been characterized as ODEs in insects, a full description implying the determination of both enzymatic activity toward odorants in vitro and participation in odorant responses in vivo, at the electrophysiological and/or behavioral level. In this chapter, we will present the pioneer works on the identification of ODEs, describe their diversity in antenna on the basis of recent transcriptomic studies, and discuss their involvement in odorant processing and termination.},

These may have negative effects on subsequent aphid colonisation and can also have positive roles with insects that are antagonistic to aphid development, for example parasitoids. One of the semiochemicals involved in host selection by aphids is methyl salicylate, and since this compound was shown to have a role as a plant stress signal, the hypothesis that aphids might facilitate identification of new plant signals was examined. Confirmation was obtained during an investigation of avoidance of unsuitable hosts by the lettuce aphid, Nasonovia ribis-nigri. (Z)-Jasmone was identified as a plant-derived semiochemical acting negatively for a number of aphid species, and positively for insect antagonists such as parasitoids and predators. However, when the compound was employed at 0.1ppm in air above intact plants, these plants then attracted aphid parasitoids long after the (Z)-jasmone itself was no longer detectable. A specific interaction was proposed, since the (Z)-jasmone appeared to be selectively taken up by the plants. Aerial interactions between intact barley plants from different cultivars, which may be differentially releasing stress associated signals, can also influence acceptability to aphids. Furthermore, it has been shown that exudates from the roots of aphid-infested plants, grown hydroponically or in soil, cause intact plants to become more attractive to parasitoids.},

	abstract = {Bark beetles (Curculionidae) have assumed increasing prominence as pests of coniferous trees and wood products. Some species of Ips and Dendroctonus introduce blue stain fungi that cause damage to trees and downgrading of wood products. In forest ecosystems, bark beetles respond to fire, frost, drought, lightening or windstorms, all of which can initiate tree stress. Silvicultural practices that improve tree vigour are widely used to manage these pests. Pruning, disposing of infested limbs and salvage logging following storm damage are also frequently employed. Systemic insecticide applications can be used to protect trees from beetle attack for several months to a year. Insecticides are also frequently used to protect trees of high value in landscape settings, seedlings in nurseries and can be used as bole sprays where trees may be treated during outbreaks Insecticides are, however, often uneconomical in natural and commercial forests, particularly in broad acre landscapes. Options for better management could involve the wider use of semiochemicals (pheromones and kairomones) that influence beetle behaviour such as feeding, mating and oviposition. Currently, semiochemicals are used extensively for monitoring bark beetle populations and for optimising timing of silviculture treatments. Semiochemical use for protecting trees using ‘push–pull’ strategies are promising and, in some cases, effective strategies for control of scolytines. Recent research shows that volatiles from unsuitable and non-host tree species could impede bark beetle attack on conifer trees. Applications of bark beetle pheromone components, such as verbenone, when used as a blend with non-host volatiles can deter scolytine bark beetles from trees. The use of semiochemicals and non-host volatiles in the management of bark beetles is, however, complicated when other insect pests and their associates are present together with bark beetles. Effective, management of bark beetles under these circumstances will depend on a better understanding of the key chemical ecology stimuli of relevance to each pest. We review semiochemicals of bark beetles and their use as interruptants or inhibitors when used together with non-host- volatiles. Implications of using semiochemicals when scolytine bark beetles attack trees together with other tree pests is discussed with an example of interactions between a wood wasp and an Ips species presented.},

Although the life histories and basic biology of the mutualists have been investigated, the biology of the fig wasp parasites has been severely neglected. This review brings together current knowledge of the many different ways in which parasites can enter the system, and also points to the serious lacunae in our understanding of the intricate interactions between gallers, kleptoparasites, seed eaters and parasitoids within this mutualism.},

By overexpressing or silencing genes of interest, it is possible to understand the specific role of a particular defensive molecule or mode of action. We argue, however, that these types of experiments alone are not enough to holistically understand the physiological as well as ecological role of plant defenses.

Olfactory system is essential for insects to perceive ever-changing chemical signals in the external environment, and chemosensory genes play crucial roles in signals reception and transduction. In this work, we compared the differences in chemosensory genes expression before and after host plants transfer by constructing 12 antennal transcriptomes of male and female bugs, respectively. The results showed that the expression levels of most chemosensory genes in A. lineolatus changed to adapt to the transformation of the hosts plant. More remarkable, female bugs had more up-regulated chemosensory genes than males. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis revealed three odorant binding proteins (OBPs), three chemosensory proteins (CSPs), eight odorant receptors (ORs) and one ionotropic receptor (IR) showed significant differences when the host plant transferred. There were complex characteristics of up- and down- regulated genes in male and female adults, among which OBP19 showed higher expression in females exposing to the new host plant alfalfa, suggesting this OBP may be associated with the localization of the oviposition site. The OR54 and OR82 were up-regulated in both genders, indicating their possible roles in recognizing some alfalfa-specific volatiles. These findings will provide valuable insights in biological functions of chemosensory genes in A. lineolatus and facilitate the development of new targets for novel strategies to control the alfalfa plant bug and other herbivores.},

	abstract = {Summary
Plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are major vehicles of information transfer between organisms and mediate many ecological interactions [1, 2, 3]. Altering VOC emission in response to herbivore damage has been hypothesized to be adaptive, as it can deter subsequent herbivores [4], attract natural enemies of herbivores [5], or transmit information about attacks between distant parts of the same plant [6, 7, 8, 9]. Neighboring plants may also respond to these VOC cues by priming their own defenses against oncoming herbivory, thereby reducing future damage [10, 11, 12]. However, under which conditions such information sharing provides fitness benefits to emitter plants, and, therefore, whether selection by herbivores affects the evolution of such VOC signaling, is still unclear [13]. Here, we test the predictions of two alternative hypotheses, the kin selection and mutual benefits hypotheses [14], to uncover the selective environment that may favor information sharing in plants. Measuring the response to natural selection in Solidago altissima, we found strong effects of herbivory on the way plants communicated with neighbors. Plants from populations that experienced selection by insect herbivory induced resistance in all neighboring conspecifics by airborne cues, whereas those from populations experiencing herbivore exclusion induced resistance only in neighbors of the same genotype. Furthermore, the information-sharing plants converged on a common, airborne VOC signal upon damage. We demonstrate that herbivory can drive the evolution of plant-plant communication via induction of airborne cues and suggest plants as a model system for understanding information sharing and communication among organisms in general.},

We investigated attraction of C. nigricana females to synthetic pea flower volatiles in a wind tunnel and in the field. We performed electroantennogram analysis on 27 previously identified pea plant volatiles, which confirmed antennal responses to nine of the compounds identified in pea flowers. A dose-dependent response was found to eight of the compounds. Various blends of the nine pea flower volatiles eliciting antennal responses were subsequently studied in a wind tunnel. A four-compound blend comprising hexan-1-ol, (E)-2-hexen-1-ol, (Z)-β-ocimene and (E)-β-ocimene was equally attractive to mated C. nigricana females as the full pea flower mimic blend. We conducted wind-tunnel tests on different blends of these four pea flower compounds mixed with a headspace sample of non-flowering pea plants. By considering the effects of such green leaf background odour, we were able to identify (Z)- and (E)-β-ocimene as fundamental for host location by the pea moths, and hexan-1-ol and (E)-2-hexen-1-ol as being of secondary importance in that context. In the field, the two isomers of β-ocimene resulted in trap catches similar to those obtained with the full pea flower mimic and the four-compound blend, which clearly demonstrated the prime significance of the β-ocimenes as attractants of C. nigricana. The high level of the trap catches of female C. nigricana noted in this first field experiment gives a first indication of the potential use of such artificial kairomones in pea moth control.},

Both essential oils had residual traces of sesquiterpenoids and are mainly composed of monoterpenes which represent 80.65\% of the total compounds identified for unripe fruits oil and 81.36\% for ripe oil. The predominant substances of the VCs of the ripe fruits were δ-3-carene (46.67\%) and α-pinene (14.98\%), whereas the major compounds of that of the unripe fruit were limonene (37.49\%) and δ-3-carene (19.98\%).

The yield of essential oil from the fruit of S. terebinthifolia as the raw material for extraction, ripe fruit were twice more productive than the unripe fruit ones. In the ripe fruit, δ-3 carene and α-pinene are possible chemical markers of this species, while limonene can be used as a substance characteristic for unripe fruit.

Where this occurs, selection for improved transmission might cause the insect mutualist to damage the plant and become a plant pathogen. Insect microbial associates can influence ecological communities by changing the way the plant interacts with their hosts’ competitors and natural enemies.

	abstract = {Semiochemicals are marker or signal chemicals transmitting information between individuals of the same species (pheromones) or different species (allelochemicals). Allelochemicals, depending on their functional roles, comprise kairomones (beneficial to the receiver), synomones (beneficial to both the emitter and receiver), allomones (beneficial to emitter), and apneumones (nonbiological origin). A pheromone of any insect is characterized by its carbon number, functional group, arrangement of double bonds, and ratio between major and minor compounds. With the advent of analytical and electrophysiological techniques, isolation, identification, and synthesis of semiochemicals become easy. Pheromones for a large number of insects belonging to various orders were identified, synthesized, formulated, and used in the field. Monitoring the insects usually for prediction of population, quarantine screening, and dispersal has been done for several species of insects. Mass trapping and mating disruption has been successfully practiced, either alone or in combination with insecticides or biocontrol technologies for effective management of insect pests. Indirectly, these methods reduce insecticide usage and facilitate conservation of natural enemies. Methyl eugenol, cuelure, and trimedlure are the common parapheromones successfully used for monitoring, mass trapping, and male annihilation. Plant volatiles either alone or in blends are used for mass trapping of several insects, especially coleopteran pests. Apart from lepidopteran, coleopteran, and dipteran insects, pheromones are often used for insects belonging to other orders, especially Homoptera (mealybugs) for monitoring purposes. Kairomones and synomones improve the performance of natural enemies. Antiaggregation pheromones and “autoconfusion” technologies are recent strategies in insect pest management. Development of cost-effective dispensers for mating disruption, semiochemical-based e-noses for monitoring, and creating farmers' awareness are suggested to facilitate the use of semiochemicals in pest management.},

We present studies on the interactions between these bioagents and various host-associated volatiles using a Y olfactometer. T chilonis was attracted to a synthetic pheromone blend (Z11-16:Ald, Z11-16:Ac, and Z11-16 011 in a 1:1:0.01 ratio), to Z11-16:Ac alone, and to a 1:1 blend of Z11-16:Ac and Z11-16:Ald. C plutellae responded to the blend and to Z11-16:Ac and Z11-16:Ald. Male and female C. carnea responded to the blend and to a 1: 1 blend of the major components of the pheromone, although no response was elicited by single compounds. Among the four host larval frass volatiles tested (dipropyl disulfide, dimethyl disulfide, allyl isothiocyanate, and dimethyl trisulfide), only allyl isothiocyanate elicited significant responses in the parasitoids and predator, but C. plutellae and both sexes of C. cornea did respond to all four volatiles. Among the green leaf volatiles of cabbage (Brassica oleracea subsp. capitata), only Z3-6:Ac elicited significant responses from T chilonis, C. plutellae, and C carnea, but C. plutellae also responded to E2-6:Ald and Z3-6:OH. When these volatiles were blended with the pheromone, the responses were similar to those elicited by the pheromone alone, except for C carnea males, which bad an increased response. The effect of temperature on the response of the biological agents to a mixture of the pheromone blend and Z3-6;Ac was also studied. T chilonis was attracted at temperatures of 25-35degreesC, while C. plutellae and C. carnea responded optimally at 30-35degreesC and 20-25degreesC, respectively. These results indicate that the sex pheromone and larval frass volatiles from the diamondback moth, as well as volatile compounds from cabbage, may be used by these natural enemies to locate their diamondback moth host.},

Releases of biochemicals as volatiles from leaves, leachates from litter, or exudates from roots have been proposed as mechanisms for this pattern, but such phytotoxicity has been controversial. I tested the hypothesis that experimental clipping of sagebrush foliage enhances its effect as a germination inhibitor. Germination of native forbs and grasses was reduced in association with clipped, compared with unclipped, sagebrush foliage in lath house and field experiments. Sagebrush seeds were not significantly affected. Air contact was required for this inhibition of germination. Soil contact and leaf litter were not required and added little inhibition of germination.

Although VOCs mainly attract predatory mites and parasitic wasps, while EFN mainly attracts ants, many more animal-plant interactions are influenced by these two traits. Other traits involved in defensive tritrophic interactions are cellular food bodies and domatia, which serve the nutrition and housing of predators. They are not known to respond to herbivory, while food body production can be induced by the presence of the mutualists. Interactions among the different defensive traits, and between them and other biotic and abiotic factors exist on the genetic, physiological, and ecological levels, but so far remain understudied. Indirect defences are increasingly being discussed as an environmentally-friendly crop protection strategy, but much more knowledge on their fitness effects under certain environmental conditions is required before we can understand their ecological and evolutionary relevance, and before tritrophic interactions can serve as a reliable tool in agronomy.},

	abstract = {Plants release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in response to wounding and herbivore attack, some of which trigger responses in neighboring unattacked plants in the laboratory under conditions that are not likely to occur in the real world. Whether plants 'eavesdrop' on the volatile emissions of their neighbors in nature is not known. The best documented field study of between-species signaling via above-ground VOCs involves increases in fitness parameters of native tobacco (Nicotiana attenuata) transplanted adjacent to clipped sagebrush (Artemesia tridentata tridentata). Clipped sagebrush releases many biologically active VOCs, including methyl jasmonate (MeJA), methacrolein and a series of terpenoid and green leaf VOCs, of which MeJA, while active under laboratory conditions, is not released in sufficient quantities to directly elicit induced resistance in the field. Here we demonstrate, with laboratory and field-based experiments, that priming (rather than direct elicitation) of native N. attenuata's induced chemical defenses by a sagebrush-released VOC bouquet can account for earlier findings. With microarrays enriched in N. attenuata herbivore-regulated genes, we found transcriptional responses in tobacco growing adjacent to clipped sagebrush foliage, but failed to detect the direct elicitation of defensive chemicals or proteins. However, we observed an accelerated production of trypsin proteinase inhibitors when Manduca sexta caterpillars fed on plants previously exposed to clipped sagebrush. This readying of a defense response, termed priming, results in lower total herbivore damage to plants exposed to clipped sagebrush and in a higher mortality rate of young Manduca caterpillars. Our study demonstrates priming of plant defense responses as a mechanism of plant-plant signaling in nature, and provides an example for the analysis of between-plant signaling under ecologically realistic conditions. Although we describe priming as a potential mechanism for signaling between plants in nature, we critically discuss the ecological relevance of the particular interaction.},

	abstract = {Plants emit volatile blends specific to particular herbivore interactions, which predators and parasitoids learn to associate with prey, increasing herbivore mortality and thereby plant fitness in a phenomenon termed indirect defence. Herbivore-induced plant volatile blends commonly include both rapid, transient green leaf volatiles (GLVs) and delayed, enduring sesquiterpenes. A few laboratory studies indicate that insects can use plant volatiles to time behaviour, but it is not known whether and how the temporal dynamics of plant volatile blends influence their function in indirect defence. We characterized the activity of the native herbivores Manduca sexta and Tupiocoris notatus and their predators, Geocoris spp., on their host plant Nicotiana attenuata in their natural habitat. Diurnal predator activity only partially overlapped with variable herbivore activity, and herbivore attack at the beginning or end of the photophase elicited plant volatile blends with distinct GLV and sesquiterpene profiles. In field trials, day-active Geocoris spp. predators preferred morning- over evening-typical GLV blends. Using plants genetically transformed so as to be unable to produce specific volatiles, we found that GLVs increased predation after dawn elicitations, whereas sesquiterpenes increased predation after dusk elicitations in field trials. We conclude that predators respond to temporal differences in plant volatile blends, and that the different dynamics of specific volatiles permit effective indirect defence despite variable herbivore activity in nature.

Recent work indicates that many plants activate systemic induced resistance after herbivore attack, although the relationship between resistance and ontogeny has not been a focus of this work. In addition, for sagebrush and a few other species, individuals near neighbors that experience simulated herbivory become more resistant to subsequent attack. Volatile, airborne cues are required for both systemic induced resistance among branches and for communication among individuals. We conducted experiments in stands of sagebrush of mixed ages to determine effects of plant age on volatile signaling between branches and individuals. Young and old control plants did not differ in levels of chewing damage that they experienced. Systemic induced resistance among branches was only observed for young plants. Young plants showed strong evidence of systemic resistance only if airflow was permitted among branches; plants with only vascular connections showed no systemic resistance. We also found evidence for volatile communication between individuals. For airborne communication, young plants were more effective emitters of cues as well as more responsive receivers of volatile cues.},

	abstract = {Hydroperoxide lyases (HPLs) catalyze the cleavage of fatty acid hydroperoxides to aldehydes and oxoacids. These volatile aldehydes play a major role in forming the aroma of many plant fruits and flowers. In addition, they have antimicrobial activity in vitro and thus are thought to be involved in the plant defense response against pest and pathogen attack. An HPL activity present in potato leaves has been characterized and shown to cleave specifically 13-hydroperoxides of both linoleic and linolenic acids to yield hexanal and 3-hexenal, respectively, and 12-oxo-dodecenoic acid. A cDNA encoding this HPL has been isolated and used to monitor gene expression in healthy and mechanically damaged potato plants. HPL gene expression is subject to developmental control, being high in young leaves and attenuated in older ones, and it is induced weakly by wounding. HPL enzymatic activity, nevertheless, remains constant in leaves of different ages and also after wounding, suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms may regulate its activity levels. Antisense-mediated HPL depletion in transgenic potato plants has identified this enzyme as a major route of 13-fatty acid hydroperoxide degradation in the leaves. Although these transgenic plants have highly reduced levels of both hexanal and 3-hexenal, they show no phenotypic differences compared with wild-type ones, particularly in regard to the expression of wound-induced genes. However, aphids feeding on the HPL-depleted plants display approximately a two-fold increase in fecundity above those feeding on nontransformed plants, consistent with the hypothesis that HPL-derived products have a negative impact on aphid performance. Thus, HPL-catalyzed production of C6 aldehydes may be a key step of a built-in resistance mechanism of plants against some sucking insect pests.},

	abstract = {Airborne communication between individuals, called "eavesdropping" in this paper, can cause plants to become more resistant to herbivores when a neighbor has been experimentally clipped. The ecological relevance of this result has been in question, since individuals may be too far apart for this interaction to affect many plants in natural populations. We investigated induced resistance to herbivory in sagebrush, Artemisia tridentata, caused by experimental clipping of the focal plant and its neighbors. We found no evidence for systemic induced resistance when one branch was clipped and another branch on the same plant was assayed for naturally occurring damage. In this experiment, air contact and plant age were not controlled. Previous work indicated that sagebrush received less damage when a neighboring upwind plant within 15 cm had been experimentally clipped. Here we found that pairs of sagebrush plants that were up to 60 cm apart were influenced by experimental clipping of a neighbor. Furthermore, we observed that most individuals had conspecific neighbors that were much closer than 60 cm. Air contact was essential for communication; treatments that reduced airflow between neighboring individuals, either because of wind direction or bagging, prevented induced resistance. Airflow was also necessary for systemic induced resistance among branches within an individual. Reports from the literature indicated that sagebrush is highly sectorial, as are many desert shrubs. Branches within a sagebrush plant do not freely exchange material via vascular connections and apparently cannot rely on an internal signaling pathway for coordinating induction of resistance to herbivores. Instead, they may use external, volatile cues. This hypothesis provides a proximal explanation for why sagebrush does not demonstrate systemic induced resistance without directed airflow, and why airborne communication between branches induces resistance.},

Here we report the first identification of an insect-induced belowground plant signal, (E)-beta-caryophyllene, which strongly attracts an entomopathogenic nematode. Maize roots release this sesquiterpene in response to feeding by larvae of the beetle Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, a maize pest that is currently invading Europe. Most North American maize lines do not release (E)-beta-caryophyllene, whereas European lines and the wild maize ancestor, teosinte, readily do so in response to D. v. virgifera attack. This difference was consistent with striking differences in the attractiveness of representative lines in the laboratory. Field experiments showed a fivefold higher nematode infection rate of D. v. virgifera larvae on a maize variety that produces the signal than on a variety that does not, whereas spiking the soil near the latter variety with authentic (E)-beta-caryophyllene decreased the emergence of adult D. v. virgifera to less than half. North American maize lines must have lost the signal during the breeding process. Development of new varieties that release the attractant in adequate amounts should help enhance the efficacy of nematodes as biological control agents against root pests like D. v. virgifera.},

	abstract = {The fatty acid hydroperoxide (HP) substrates required for the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) and green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are supplied by separate lipoxygenases (LOX). We silenced the expression of two genes downstream of the LOX: allene oxide synthase (AOS) and HP lyase (HPL) by antisense expression of endogenous genes (NaAOS, NaHPL) in Nicotiana attenuata, in which the biosynthesis of JA is amplified by herbivore-specific elicitors. We report that these elicitors also amplify wound-induced GLV releases, but suppress the wound-induced increase of NaHPL transcripts, suggesting that substrate flux controls GLV biosynthesis. As expected, silencing of NaHPL and NaAOS reduced GLV release and JA accumulation, respectively. Surprisingly, HPL- and AOS-silenced plants had enhanced JA and GLV responses, suggesting substrate 'crosstalk' between these two oxylipin cascades. Plants with depleted GLVs (as-hpl) were less attractive than wild type (WT) or empty vector control plants in choice-tests with native lepidopteran herbivores. In feeding trials, Manduca sexta larvae developed slower on as-hpl plants. The reduced larval consumption and performance, which was not caused by increases in defense responses in as-hpl plants, could be restored to WT levels by the addition of synthetic GLVs, demonstrating that GLVs function as feeding stimulants. Gene expression profiling by cDNA microarray analysis and characterization of several induced defenses in herbivore-elicited as-hpl and as-aos plants revealed differential involvement of JA and GLVs in defense signaling. Elicitation of volatile terpenoids (an indirect defense) requires JA signaling, where as trypsin protease inhibitor elicitation (a direct defense) requires both functional JA and GLV cascades.},

	abstract = {Plants respond to herbivore attack with the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can attract predatory arthropods and/or repel herbivores and thus serve as a means of defense against herbivores. Such VOCs might also be perceived by neighboring plants to adjust their defensive phenotype according to the present risk of attack. We exposed lima bean plants at their natural growing site to volatiles of beetle-damaged conspecific shoots. This reduced herbivore damage and increased the growth rate of the exposed plants. To investigate whether VOCs also can serve in signaling processes within the same individual plant we focused on undamaged "receiver" leaves that were either exposed or not exposed to VOCs released by induced "emitter" leaves. Extrafloral nectar secretion by receiver leaves increased when they were exposed to VOCs of induced emitters of neighboring plants or of the same shoot, yet not when VOCs were removed from the system. Extrafloral nectar attracts predatory arthropods and represents an induced defense mechanism. The volatiles also primed extrafloral nectar secretion to show an augmented response to subsequent damage. Herbivore-induced VOCs elicit a defensive response in undamaged plants (or parts of plants) under natural conditions, and they function as external signal for within-plant communication, thus serving also a physiological role in the systemic response of a plant to local damage.},

	abstract = {Plants infested with herbivorous arthropods emit complex blends of volatile compounds, which are used by several natural enemies as foraging cues. Despite detailed knowledge on the composition and amount of the emitted volatiles in many plant-herbivore systems, it remains largely unknown which compounds are essential for the attraction of natural enemies. In this study, we used a combination of different fractionation methods and olfactometer bioassays in order to examine the attractiveness of different compositions of volatile blends to females of the parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris. In a first step, we passed a volatile blend emitted by Spodoptera littoralis infested maize seedlings over a silica-containing filter tube and subsequently desorbed the volatiles that were retained by the silica filter (silica extract). The volatiles that broke through the silica filter were collected on and subsequently desorbed from a SuperQ filter (breakthrough). The silica extract was highly attractive to the wasps, whereas the breakthrough volatiles were not attractive. The silica extract was even more attractive than the extract that contained all herbivore-induced maize volatiles. Subsequently, we fractioned the silica extract by preparative gas-chromatography (GC) and by separating more polar from less polar compounds. In general, C. marginiventris preferred polar over non-polar compounds, but several fractions were attractive to the wasp, including one that contained compounds emitted in quantities below the detection threshold of the GC analysis. These results imply that the attractiveness of the volatile blend emitted by Spodoptera-infested maize seedlings to C. marginiventris females is determined by a specific combination of attractive and repellent/masking compounds, including some that are emitted in very small amounts. Manipulating the emission of such minor compounds has the potential to greatly improve the attraction of certain parasitoids and enhance biological control of specific insect pests.},

Rather than acting as passive victims in these interactions, plants respond to herbivory with the production of toxins and defensive proteins that target physiological processes in the insect. Herbivore-challenged plants also emit volatiles that attract insect predators and bolster resistance to future threats. This highly dynamic form of immunity is initiated by the recognition of insect oral secretions and signals from injured plant cells. These initial cues are transmitted within the plant by signal transduction pathways that include calcium ion fluxes, phosphorylation cascades, and, in particular, the jasmonate pathway, which plays a central and conserved role in promoting resistance to a broad spectrum of insects. A detailed understanding of plant immunity to arthropod herbivores will provide new insights into basic mechanisms of chemical communication and plant-animal coevolution and may also facilitate new approaches to crop protection and improvement.},

Blocking air flow with plastic bags made this effect undetectable. However, some scientists remained skeptical about the possibility of volatile communication between plants since the existence and identity of a cue that operates in nature have never been demonstrated. We conducted an air transfer experiment that collected air from the headspace of an experimentally clipped donor plant and delivered it to the headspace of an unclipped assay plant. We found that assay plants treated with air from clipped donors were less likely to be damaged by naturally occurring herbivores in a field experiment. This simple air transfer experiment fulfills the most critical of Koch's postulates and provides more definitive evidence for volatile communication between plants. It also provides an inexpensive experimental protocol that can be used to screen plants for interplant communication in the field.},

The resulting hydroxycinnamic acids and esters are amplified in several cascades by a combination of reductases, oxygenases, and transferases to result in an organ and developmentally specific pattern of metabolites, characteristic for each plant species. During the last decade, methodology driven targeted and non-targeted approaches in several plant species have enabled the identification of the participating enzymes of this complex biosynthetic machinery, and revealed numerous genes, enzymes, and metabolites essential for regulation and compartmentation. Considerable success in structural and computational biology, combined with the analytical sensitivity to detect even trace compounds and smallest changes in the metabolite, transcript, or enzyme pattern, has facilitated progress towards a comprehensive view of the plant response to its biotic and abiotic environment. Transgenic approaches have been used to reveal insights into an apparently redundant gene and enzyme pattern required for functional integrity and plasticity of the various phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways. Nevertheless, the function and impact of all members of a gene family remain to be completely established. This review aims to give an update on the various facets of the general phenylpropanoid pathway, which is not only restricted to common lignin or flavonoid biosynthesis, but feeds into a variety of other aromatic metabolites like coumarins, phenolic volatiles, or hydrolyzable tannins.},

	abstract = {cis-jasmone, or (Z)-jasmone, is well known as a component of plant volatiles, and its release can be induced by damage, for example during insect herbivory. Using the olfactory system of the lettuce aphid to investigate volatiles from plants avoided by this insect, (Z)-jasmone was found to be electrophysiologically active and also to be repellent in laboratory choice tests. In field studies, repellency from traps was demonstrated for the damson-hop aphid, and with cereal aphids numbers were reduced in plots of winter wheat treated with (Z)-jasmone. In contrast, attractant activity was found in laboratory and wind tunnel tests for insects acting antagonistically to aphids, namely the seven-spot ladybird and an aphid parasitoid. When applied in the vapor phase to intact bean plants, (Z)-jasmone induced the production of volatile compounds, including the monoterpene (E)-beta-ocimene, which affect plant defense, for example by stimulating the activity of parasitic insects. These plants were more attractive to the aphid parasitoid in the wind tunnel when tested 48 h after exposure to (Z)-jasmone had ceased. This possible signaling role of (Z)-jasmone is qualitatively different from that of the biosynthetically related methyl jasmonate and gives a long-lasting effect after removal of the stimulus. Differential display was used to compare mRNA populations in bean leaves exposed to the vapor of (Z)-jasmone and methyl jasmonate. One differentially displayed fragment was cloned and shown by Northern blotting to be up-regulated in leaf tissue by (Z)-jasmone. This sequence was identified by homology as being derived from a gene encoding an alpha-tubulin isoform.},

Here we show that exposure to Tetranychus urticae-induced volatiles, as well as T. urticae infestation and artificial wounding, activates the transcription of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of ethylene [S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthetase and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase] and a gene involved in the biosynthesis of polyamines from SAM (SAM decarboxylase) in lima bean leaves. Moreover, exposure of leaves to any one of the seven major chemical components of T. urticae-induced volatiles also induces expression of these genes. Furthermore, we found that, when lima bean plants were exposed to T. urticae-induced volatiles, they emitted ethylene. Lima bean plants infested by T. urticae and artificially wounded plants also emitted ethylene. Endogenous polyamine levels were not increased in the exposed leaves or the infested leaves, suggesting that polyamine production from SAM was only slightly promoted at the metabolic levels present in the leaves. We found that jasmonate (JA) accumulated in leaves exposed to T. urticae-induced volatiles, and that both JA and salicylate (SA) accumulated in leaves infested by T. urticae. These findings, as well as results of pharmacological analyses, suggest that, in leaves exposed to T. urticae-induced volatiles, ethylene biosynthesis might be regulated by pathways involving JA and the ethylene positive feedback loop. They also suggest that ethylene biosynthesis might be regulated by signaling pathways involving JA, SA and ethylene in T. urticae-infested leaves.},

	abstract = {Genetic manipulation of plant volatile emissions is a promising tool to enhance plant defences against herbivores. However, the potential costs associated with the manipulation of specific volatile synthase genes are unknown. Therefore, we investigated the physiological and ecological effects of transforming a maize line with a terpene synthase gene in field and laboratory assays, both above- and below ground. The transformation, which resulted in the constitutive emission of (E)-β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, was found to compromise seed germination, plant growth and yield. These physiological costs provide a possible explanation for the inducibility of an (E)-β-caryophyllene-synthase gene in wild and cultivated maize. The overexpression of the terpene synthase gene did not impair plant resistance nor volatile emission. However, constitutive terpenoid emission increased plant apparency to herbivores, including adults and larvae of the above ground pest Spodoptera frugiperda, resulting in an increase in leaf damage. Although terpenoid overproducing lines were also attractive to the specialist root herbivore Diabrotica virgifera virgifera below ground, they did not suffer more root damage in the field, possibly because of the enhanced attraction of entomopathogenic nematodes. Furthermore, fewer adults of the root herbivore Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardii were found to emerge near plants that emitted (E)-β-caryophyllene and α-humulene. Yet, overall, under the given field conditions, the costs of constitutive volatile production overshadowed its benefits. This study highlights the need for a thorough assessment of the physiological and ecological consequences of genetically engineering plant signals in the field to determine the potential of this approach for sustainable pest management strategies.},

	abstract = {Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are a diverse group of fatty acid-derived compounds emitted by all plants and are involved in a wide variety of developmental and stress-related biological functions. Recently, GLV emission bursts from leaves were reported following light-dark transitions and hypothesized to be related to the stress response while acetaldehyde bursts were hypothesized to be due to the 'pyruvate overflow' mechanism. In this study, branch emissions of GLVs and a group of oxygenated metabolites (acetaldehyde, ethanol, acetic acid, and acetone) derived from the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) bypass pathway were quantified from mesquite plants following light-dark transitions using a coupled GC-MS, PTR-MS, and photosynthesis system. Within the first minute after darkening following a light period, large emission bursts of both C(5) and C(6) GLVs dominated by (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate together with the PDH bypass metabolites are reported for the first time. We found that branches exposed to CO(2)-free air lacked significant GLV and PDH bypass bursts while O(2)-free atmospheres eliminated the GLV burst but stimulated the PDH bypass burst. A positive relationship was observed between photosynthetic activity prior to darkening and the magnitude of the GLV and PDH bursts. Photosynthesis under (13)CO(2) resulted in bursts with extensive labeling of acetaldehyde, ethanol, and the acetate but not the C(6)-alcohol moiety of (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate. Our observations are consistent with (1) the "pyruvate overflow" mechanism with a fast turnover time ({\textless}1 h) as part of the PDH bypass pathway, which may contribute to the acetyl-CoA used for the acetate moiety of (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate, and (2) a pool of fatty acids with a slow turnover time ({\textgreater}3 h) responsible for the C(6) alcohol moiety of (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate via the 13-lipoxygenase pathway. We conclude that our non-invasive method may provide a new valuable in vivo tool for studies of acetyl-CoA and fatty acid metabolism in plants at a variety of spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Information exchange (or signaling) between plants following herbivore damage has recently been shown to affect plant responses to herbivory in relatively simple natural systems. In a large, manipulative field study using three annual plant species (Achyrachaena mollis, Lupinus nanus, and Sinapis arvensis), we tested whether experimental damage to a neighboring conspecific affected a plant's lifetime fitness and interactions with herbivores. By manipulating relatedness between plants, we assessed whether genetic relatedness of neighboring individuals influenced the outcome of having a damaged neighbor. Additionally, in laboratory feeding assays, we assessed whether damage to a neighboring plant specifically affected palatability to a generalist herbivore and, for S. arvensis, a specialist herbivore. Our study suggested a high level of contingency in the outcomes of plant signaling. For example, in the field, damaging a neighbor resulted in greater herbivory to A. mollis, but only when the damaged neighbor was a close relative. Similarly, in laboratory trials, the palatability of S. arvensis to a generalist herbivore increased after the plant was exposed to a damaged neighbor, while palatability to a specialist herbivore decreased. Across all species, damage to a neighbor resulted in decreased lifetime fitness, but only if neighbors were closely related. These results suggest that the outcomes of plant signaling within multi-species neighborhoods may be far more context-specific than has been previously shown. In particular, our study shows that herbivore interactions and signaling between plants are contingent on the genetic relationship between neighboring plants. Many factors affect the outcomes of plant signaling, and studies that clarify these factors will be necessary in order to assess the role of plant information exchange about herbivory in natural systems.},

	abstract = {Almost all terrestrial plants produce green leaf volatiles (GLVs), consisting of six-carbon (C6) aldehydes, alcohols and their esters, after mechanical wounding. C6 aldehydes deter enemies, but C6 alcohols and esters are rather inert. In this study, we address why the ability to produce various GLVs in wounded plant tissues has been conserved in the plant kingdom. The major product in completely disrupted Arabidopsis leaf tissues was (Z)-3-hexenal, while (Z)-3-hexenol and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate were the main products formed in the intact parts of partially wounded leaves. 13C-labeled C6 aldehydes placed on the disrupted part of a wounded leaf diffused into neighboring intact tissues and were reduced to C6 alcohols. The reduction of the aldehydes to alcohols was catalyzed by an NADPH-dependent reductase. When NADPH was supplemented to disrupted tissues, C6 aldehydes were reduced to C6 alcohols, indicating that C6 aldehydes accumulated because of insufficient NADPH. When the leaves were exposed to higher doses of C6 aldehydes, however, a substantial fraction of C6 aldehydes persisted in the leaves and damaged them, indicating potential toxicity of C6 aldehydes to the leaf cells. Thus, the production of C6 aldehydes and their differential metabolisms in wounded leaves has dual benefits. In disrupted tissues, C6 aldehydes and their α,β-unsaturated aldehyde derivatives accumulate to deter invaders. In intact cells, the aldehydes are reduced to minimize self-toxicity and allow healthy cells to survive. The metabolism of GLVs is thus efficiently designed to meet ecophysiological requirements of the microenvironments within a wounded leaf.},

In Environmental Physics micrometeorology has been very effectively used to study hydrology, environmental physiology, and ecology. The turbulent boundary layer that develops over extensive soil and vegetation surfaces grows at a rate depending on surface roughness and atmospheric stability. Properties of turbulence are discussed, leading to a review of the principles of the eddy covariance method of studying rates of turbulent transfer of heat mass and momentum (fluxes) in the surface boundary layer. Instrumentation requirements for, and corrections necessary to eddy covariance measurements, are summarized. The less direct method of studying turbulent fluxes by relating analyzing mean vertical gradients (profiles) of windspeed, temperature, and mass concentration is also reviewed. Roughness parameters depending on vegetation height and structure influence profile properties. Aerodynamic resistance is derived as a quantity relating momentum flux to windspeed gradients. The influence of atmospheric stability on profiles and therefore on fluxes is reviewed, including issues encountered when measuring close to vegetation elements. Principles of the aerodynamic and Bowen ratio methods for estimating fluxes from gradients are reviewed, and the strengths and weaknesses of eddy covariance and flux-gradient methods are summarized. Finally, aspects of turbulent transfer in vegetation canopies are discussed.},

Using maize plants, Zea mays, whose leaves respond strongly to leaf HIPVs, we measured the impact of belowground HIPVs, emanating from roots infested by the banded cucumber beetle, Diabrotica balteata, on constitutive and herbivore-induced levels of defense-related gene expression, phytohormones, volatile and non-volatile primary and secondary metabolites, growth and herbivore resistance in roots of neighbouring plants. HIPV exposure did not increase constitutive or induced levels of any of the measured root traits. Furthermore, HIPV exposure did not reduce the performance or survival of D. balteata on maize or its ancestor teosinte. Cross-exposure experiments between HIPVs from roots and leaves revealed that maize roots, in contrast to maize leaves, neither emit nor respond strongly to defense-regulating HIPVs. Together, these results demonstrate that volatile-mediated defense regulation is restricted to the leaves of maize. This finding is in line with the lower diffusibility of volatiles in the soil and the availability of other, potentially more efficient, information conduits below ground.},

	abstract = {Plant volatile emissions can recruit predators of herbivores for indirect defense and attract pollinators to aid in pollination. Although volatiles involved in defense and pollinator attraction are primarily emitted from leaves and flowers, respectively, they will co-evolve if their underlying genetic basis is intrinsically linked, due either to pleiotropy or to genetic linkage. However, direct evidence of co-evolving defense and floral traits is scarce. We characterized intraspecific variation of herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), the key components of indirect defense against herbivores, and floral volatiles in wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata. We found that variation of (E)-β-ocimene and (E)-α-bergamotene contributed to the correlated changes in HIPVs and floral volatiles among N. attenuata natural accessions. Intraspecific variations of (E)-β-ocimene and (E)-α-bergamotene emissions resulted from allelic variation of two genetically co-localized terpene synthase genes, NaTPS25 and NaTPS38, respectively. Analyzing haplotypes of NaTPS25 and NaTPS38 revealed that allelic variations of NaTPS25 and NaTPS38 resulted in correlated changes of (E)-β-ocimene and (E)-α-bergamotene emission in HIPVs and floral volatiles in N. attenuata. Together, these results provide evidence that pleiotropy and genetic linkage result in correlated changes in defenses and floral signals in natural populations, and the evolution of plant volatiles is probably under diffuse selection.},

	abstract = {Interest in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as air pollutants has increased dramatically in recent years. This book covers a number of very topical issues concerning VOCs, including stratospheric ozone depletion due to CFCs, and the properties of alternative substances; the role of VOCs in the photochemical formation of lower atmosphere (tropospheric) ozone; and the problem of the direct toxicity of VOCs such as benzene and formaldehyde.This Issue reviews our current knowledge of VOCs, drawing upon the expertise of renowned experts and major national and international research programmes. It examines man-made and natural sources, as well as pathways and chemical reactions in the atmosphere. It also looks closely at the sources and concentrations of VOCs indoors, where humans are most likely to be exposed to them.Volatile Organic Compounds in the Atmosphere describes techniques used for the calculation of emissions inventories and strategies for control, and explores the many Government policy matters relating to VOCs. It provides readers with in-depth, clearly explained coverage of the many complex scientific and policy issues surrounding VOCs in the atmosphere.},

CCDs often exhibit substrate promiscuity, which probably contributes to the diversity of apocarotenoids found in nature. Biologically and commercially important apocarotenoids include the phytohormone abscisic acid, the visual and signaling molecules retinal and retinoic acid, and the aromatic volatile beta-ionone. Unexpected properties associated with the CCD catalytic products emphasize their role in many aspects of plant growth and development. For instance, CCD7 and CCD8 produce a novel, graft-transmissible hormone that controls axillary shoot growth in plants. Here, CCDs are discussed according to their roles in the biosynthesis of these products. Recent studies regarding their mechanism of action are also addressed.},

	doi = {10.5194/bg-4-1083-2007},
	abstract = {Methanol is found throughout the troposphere, with average concentrations second only to methane among atmospheric hydrocarbons. Proposed global methanol budgets are highly uncertain, but all agree that at least 60\% of the total source arises from the terrestrial biosphere and primary emissions from plants. However, the magnitude of these emissions is also highly uncertain, and the environmental factors which control them require further elucidation. Using a temperature-controlled leaf enclosure, we measured methanol emissions from leaves of six plant species by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry, with simultaneous measurements of leaf evapotranspiration and stomatal conductance. Rates of emission at 30°C varied from 0.2 to 38 μgg (dry mass) -1 h-1, with higher rates measured on young leaves, consistent with the production of methanol via pectin demethylation in expanding foliage. On average, emissions increased by a factor of 2.3 for each 10°C increase in leaf temperature. At constant temperature, emissions were also correlated with co-varying incident photosynthetic photon flux density and rates of stomatal conductance. The data were analyzed using the emission model developed by Niinemets and Reichstein (2003a, b), with the incorporation of a methanol production term that increased exponentially with temperature. It was concluded that control of emissions, during daytime, was shared by leaf temperature and stomatal conductance, although rates of production may also vary diurnally in response to variations in leaf growth rate in expanding leaves. The model, which generally provided reasonable simulations of the measured data during the day, significantly overestimated emissions on two sets of measurements made through the night, suggesting that production rates of methanol were reduced at night, perhaps because leaf growth was reduced or possibly through a direct effect of light on production. Although the short-term dynamics of methanol emissions can be successfully modeled only if stomatal conductance and compound solubility are taken into account, emissions on longer time scales will be determined by rates of methanol production, controls over which remain to be investigated.},

	abstract = {Trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre6P) is an essential signal metabolite in plants, linking growth and development to carbon metabolism. The sucrose-Tre6P nexus model postulates that Tre6P acts as both a signal and negative feedback regulator of sucrose levels. To test this model, short-term metabolic responses to induced increases in Tre6P levels were investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing the Escherichia coli Tre6P synthase (otsA) under the control of an ethanol-inducible promoter. Increased Tre6P led to a transient drop in sucrose content, post-translational activation of nitrate reductase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, and increased levels of organic and amino acids. Radio- ((14) CO2 ) and stable-isotope ((13) CO2 ) labelling experiments showed no change in the rates of photoassimilate export in plants with elevated Tre6P, but increased labelling of organic acids. It is concluded that high Tre6P lowers sucrose levels by stimulating nitrate assimilation and anaplerotic synthesis of organic acids, thereby diverting photoassimilates away from sucrose to generate carbon skeletons and fixed nitrogen for amino acid synthesis. These results are consistent with the sucrose-Tre6P nexus model and implicate Tre6P in coordinating carbon and nitrogen metabolism in plants. This article is protected by copyright.

	abstract = {After herbivore attack, plants launch a suite of direct and indirect defense responses that must be coor- dinated if plants are to realize a fitness benefit from these responses. Here we characterize the volatile emis- sions in the native tobacco plant, Nicotiana attenuata Torr. ex Wats., that are elicited by tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta L.) attack and are known to function as attractants for parasitoids. To provide the first ecophysio- logical comparison of examples of both types of defense in the same species, we characterize the elicitation and signaling mechanisms, the resources required, and the potential costs and benefits of the volatile release and compare these traits with those of the well-described in- duced direct defense in this species, nicotine production. The release of (E)-β-ocimene, cis-α-bergamotene and li- nalool is dramatically induced within 24 h by application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA), caterpillar feeding, and the treatment of mechanical wounds with larval oral secre- tions (OS), but not by mechanical damage alone. Plants from different geographic locations produce volatile blends that differ in composition. The most consistently released component from all genotypes, cis-α-berga- motene, is positively related to the amount of MeJA and the level of wounding if OS are applied to the wounds. The volatile release is strongly light dependent, dropping to undetectable quantities during dark periods, even when temperatures are elevated to match those of the light period. Inhibitors of wound-induced jasmonate ac- cumulation (salicylates and auxins), which are known to inhibit wound-induced nicotine production, do not inhib- it the release of volatiles. By individually inducing dif- ferent leaf positions with OS and, on other plants, excis- ing them after induction, we demonstrate that the emis- sion is largely a systemic, whole-plant response, which is maximally triggered when the second fully expanded leaf is induced. We conclude that while both are whole- plant, systemic responses that utilize recently acquired resources for their production and are activated by the jasmonate cascade, the elicitation of the volatile release exhibits greater tissue sensitivity and utilizes additional signaling components than does nicotine production. In contrast to the large investment of fitness-limiting re- sources required for induced nicotine production or the resources used in benzyl acetone release from flowers for pollinator attraction, the…},

The C(16)-homoterpene TMTT (for 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene) is emitted after herbivore attack by a wide variety of plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, and is assumed to play a role in attracting predators or parasitoids of herbivores. TMTT has been suggested to be formed as a degradation product of the diterpene alcohol (E,E)-geranyllinalool. Here, we report the identification of Terpene Synthase 04 (TPS04; At1g61120) as a geranyllinalool synthase (GES). Recombinant TPS04/GES protein expressed in Escherichia coli catalyzes the formation of (E,E)-geranyllinalool from the substrate geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines carrying T-DNA insertions in the TPS04 locus are deficient in (E,E)-geranyllinalool and TMTT synthesis, a phenotype that can be complemented by expressing the GES gene under the control of a heterologous promoter. GES transcription is upregulated under conditions that induce (E,E)-geranyllinalool and TMTT synthesis, including infestation of plants with larvae of the moth Plutella xylostella and treatment with the fungal peptide alamethicin or the octadecanoid mimic coronalon. Induction requires jasmonic acid but is independent from salicylic acid or ethylene. This study paves the ground to address the contribution of TMTT in ecological interactions and to elucidate the signaling network that regulates TMTT synthesis.},

We found that Manduca sexta-infested Nicotiana attenuata attract the generalist hemipteran predator Geocoris spp. as the result of an herbivore-induced decrease in the (Z)/(E) ratio of released GLVs, and that these changes in the volatile bouquet triple the foraging efficiency of predators in nature. These (E)-isomers are produced from plant-derived (Z)-isomers but are converted by a heat-labile constituent of herbivore oral secretions. Hence, attacking herbivores initiate the release of an indirect defense a full day before the attacked plants manufacture their own defensive compounds.},

In response to aphid infestation, many plants initiate indirect defenses through the release of volatiles that attract ladybugs, parasitoid wasps, and other aphid-consuming predators. Aphid-induced volatile release in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana requires the jasmonate signaling pathway. Volatile release is also induced by infection with aphid-transmitted viruses. Consistent with mathematical models of optimal transmission, viruses that are acquired rapidly by aphids induce volatile release to attract migratory aphids, but discourage long-term aphid feeding. Although the ecology of these interactions is well-studied, further research is needed to identify the molecular basis of aphid-induced and virus-induced changes in plant volatile release.},

	abstract = {Insect herbivory on plants is a complex incident consisting of at least two different aspects, mechanical damage and chemical factors. Only the combination of both is able to induce the respective plant defenses. Thus, diverse plant species emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in response to herbivory (HW), whereas mechanical damage inflicted as single wounding event (MD) does not induce increased VOC emissions. In contrast, a robotic worm (MecWorm, MW) allowed demonstrating that continuous mechanical damage is sufficient to induce volatile emission in Lima bean. However, the induced VOC blends remain characteristic for the respective stimulus. In order to identify putative differences in plant signaling leading to defenses, we compared time courses of early signals induced by wounding in Lima bean. Neither MD nor MW alone was able to induce plasma membrane (V (m)) depolarization, as observed after Spodoptera littoralis HW, but V (m) depolarization occurred in both treatments when used in combination with herbivore-derived oral secretions. A significant increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations was observed only after HW, whereas MD and MW did not affect this second messenger. H(2)O(2) was generated within 2-3 h after leaf damage by HW and MW, whereas MD induced only half of the H(2)O(2) levels compared to the other treatments. Both HW and MW induced a marked accumulation of NO, but with distinct temporal patterns. NO production after MD followed the same trend but reached significantly lower values. The results indicate that chemical signals from the herbivores are responsible for the induction of the earliest signaling events. These changes appear to be characteristic for the reaction to herbivory.},

Insects can locate their hosts even though the host plants are often hidden among an array of other plants. Plant volatiles play an important role in this host-location process. The recognition of a host plant by these olfactory signals could occur by using either species-specific compounds or specific ratios of ubiquitous compounds. Currently, most studies favor the second scenario, with strong evidence that plant discrimination is due to central processing of olfactory signals by the insect, rather than their initial detection. Furthermore, paired or clustered olfactory receptor neurons might enable fine-scale spatio-temporal resolution of the complex signals encountered when ubiquitous compounds are used.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Herbivore-induced plant volatiles, or HIPVs, are increasingly considered as a biocontrol enhancement tool by constitutively emitting these carnivore-attracting chemicals from agricultural fields. While ample data substantiate the olfactory preference of predators for HIPVs in laboratory environments, little is understood about the consequences of 'turning crops on' in the field. To explore the ramifications for arthropod pest management, a spatially explicit predator-prey population model was constructed that simulated a crop field releasing signals to recruit natural enemies from the surrounding landscape. RESULTS: Field size had an overriding influence on model outcome, both isolated as a single factor and interactively shaping responses to other parameters (e.g. habituation, foraging efficiency). Predator recruitment exponentially declined with increasing field size from nearly double the baseline density in small fields (225 individuals m(-2) ) to a mere 4\% increase (130 individuals m(-2) ) in large fields. Correspondingly, HIPVs enhanced pest consumption in small fields (ca 50\% fewer prey), while generating virtually no impact in large fields. CONCLUSION: Collectively, the model suggests that reducing the perimeter/core area ratio will ultimately constrain the utility of predator retention as a pest control tactic in commercial-sized fields and illustrates potential consequences of the widespread commercialization of this technology in agriculture. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.},

	abstract = {Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPV) provide important information that influences host location behaviour for insect natural enemies, such as parasitoid wasps, that develop in the bodies of herbivorous insects. The dietary breadth of both the parasitoid and its host may affect the extent to which a searching parasitoid relies on HIPV. Specialist species are expected to rely on specific volatile cues to which they respond innately, whereas generalists are expected to show a higher degree of phenotypic plasticity that depends on foraging experience in the parasitoid. We compared the response to HIPV emitted by different plant species damaged by host and nonhost caterpillars for two congeneric parasitoid species, the specialist . Diadegma semiclausum and the generalist . Diadegma fenestrale, attacking caterpillars of the diamondback moth, . Plutella xylostella. For the three tested plant species, . Brassica oleracea, a feral . Brassica population and . Sinapis alba, both parasitoid species preferred volatiles from host-infested plants over those produced by undamaged plants. However, both parasitoid species only distinguished between volatiles induced by host and nonhosts when the caterpillars had been feeding on . B. oleracea, the plant on which they had been reared. Chemical analysis of the volatile blends could not explain volatile preferences of the parasitoids. Despite the difference in their dietary breadth, the two parasitoids responded similarly to HIPV and experience treatments. A flexible response to a wide array of volatile blends by parasitoids is probably important in nature, given that different generations of the host and the parasitoid probably develop on different food plants. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

We used a genetic mapping population of wild tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata , originating from a cross of 2 natural accessions from Arizona and Utah, separated by the Grand Canyon, to dissect genetic variation controlling VOCs. Herbivory-induced leaf terpenoid emissions varied substantially, while green leaf volatile emissions were similar. In a field experiment, only emissions of linalool, a common VOC, correlated significantly with predation of the herbivore Manduca sexta by native predators. Using quantitative trait locus mapping and genome mining, we identified an ( S )-(+)-linalool synthase ( NaLIS ). Genome resequencing, gene cloning, and activity assays revealed that the presence/absence of a 766-bp sequence in NaLIS underlies the variation of linalool emissions in 26 natural accessions. We manipulated linalool emissions and composition by ectopically expressing linalool synthases for both enantiomers, ( S )-(+)- and ( R )-(−)-linalool, reported to oppositely affect M. sexta oviposition, in the Arizona and Utah accessions. We used these lines to test ovipositing moths in increasingly complex environments. The enantiomers had opposite effects on oviposition preference, but the magnitude of the effect depended strongly both on plant genetic background, and complexity of the bioassay environment. Our study reveals that the emission of linalool, a common VOC, differs by orders-of-magnitude among geographically interspersed conspecific plants due to allelic variation in a linalool synthase, and that the response of a specialist herbivore to linalool depends on enantiomer, plant genotype, and environmental complexity.},

	abstract = {All plants synthesize a suite of several hundred terpenoid compounds with roles that include phytohormones, protein modification reagents, anti-oxidants, and more. Different plant lineages also synthesize hundreds of distinct terpenoids, with the total number of such specialized plant terpenoids estimated in the scores of thousands. Phylogenetically restricted terpenoids are implicated in defense or in the attraction of beneficial organisms. A popular hypothesis is that the ability of plants to synthesize new compounds arose incrementally by selection when, as a result of gradual changes in their biotic partners and enemies, the ‘old’ plant compounds were no longer effective, a process dubbed the ‘coevolutionary arms race’. Another hypothesis posits that often the sheer diversity of such compounds provides benefits that a single compound cannot. In this article, we review the unique features of the biosynthetic apparatus of terpenes in plants that facilitate the production of large numbers of distinct terpenoids in each species and how facile genetic and biochemical changes can lead to the further diversification of terpenoids. We then discuss evidence relating to the hypotheses that given ecological functions may be enhanced by the presence of mixtures of terpenes and that the acquisition of new functions by terpenoids may favor their retention once the original functions are lost.},

Volatiles were collected throughout the experiments, and leaf tissue was collected to measure phytohormone concentrations and expression of defense-related genes. * Relative to controls, z3HAC-exposed leaves had higher concentrations of jasmonic acid and linolenic acid following gypsy moth feeding. Furthermore, z3HAC primed transcripts of genes that mediate oxylipin signaling and direct defenses, as determined by both qRT-PCR and microarray analysis using the AspenDB 7 K expressed sequence tags (EST) microarray containing c. 5400 unique gene models. Moreover, z3HAC primed the release of terpene volatiles. * The widespread priming response suggests an adaptive benefit to detecting z3HAC as a wound signal. Thus, woody plants can detect and use z3HAC as a signal to prime defenses before actually experiencing damage. GLVs may therefore have important ecological functions in arboreal ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Plant volatile organic compound (VOC) production requires a complex network of biochemical pathways, which, although well mapped from a biochemical point of view, remains only partly understood with regard to its physiological and genetic regulation. Additionally, although analytical procedures for plant VOC measurement have become increasingly faster and more sensitive in recent years, pinpointing relevant shifts in VOC production from the thousands of molecular fragments that are generated by modern mass spectrometer instruments remains challenging. Here we discuss novel opportunities for system-wide analysis provided by the implementation of non-targeted data processing and multivariate statistics in VOC analysis. We illustrate the value of implementing non-targeted data processing with examples of recent findings from our group on the interactive control exerted by salivary components of a lepidopteran herbivore, Manduca sexta, on herbivory-induced VOC emissions in the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata. Finally, we briefly discuss the use of multi-platform data integration for probing the nature of metabolic and regulatory systems underlying VOC emissions.},

The results suggest that the circadian clock controls flower opening, BA emission, and pedicel movement, but not flower closing. • We generated transgenic N. attenuata lines silenced in the homologous genes of Arabidopsis LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and ZEITLUPE (ZTL), which are known as a core clock component.

	abstract = {Plants are at the trophic base of terrestrial ecosystems, and the diversity of plant species in an ecosystem is a principle determinant of community structure. This may arise from diverse functional traits among species. In fact, genetic diversity within species can have similarly large effects. However, studies of intraspecific genetic diversity have used genotypes varying in several complex traits, obscuring the specific phenotypic variation responsible for community-level effects. Using lines of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata genetically altered in specific well-characterized defense traits and planted into experimental populations in their native habitat, we investigated community-level effects of trait diversity in populations of otherwise isogenic plants. We conclude that the frequency of defense traits in a population can determine the outcomes of these traits for individuals. Furthermore, our results suggest that some ecosystem-level services afforded by genetically diverse plant populations could be recaptured in intensive monocultures engineered to be functionally diverse.},

However, other animals and competing plants can intercept HIPVs for their own use, and it remains unclear whether HIPVs serve as an indirect defense by increasing fitness for the emitting plant. In a 2-year field study, HIPV-emitting N. attenuata plants produced twice as many buds and flowers as HIPV-silenced plants, but only when native Geocoris spp. predators reduced herbivore loads (by 50\%) on HIPV-emitters. In concert with HIPVs, plants also employ antidigestive trypsin protease inhibitors (TPIs), but TPI-producing plants were not fitter than TPI-silenced plants. TPIs weakened a specialist herbivore's behavioral evasive responses to simulated Geocoris spp. attack, indicating that TPIs function against specialists by enhancing indirect defense.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00007.001.},

Using spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) and predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis), it has been shown that not only the attacked plant but also neighbouring plants are affected, becoming more attractive to predatory mites and less susceptible to spider mites. The mechanism involved in such interactions, however, remains elusive. Here we show that uninfested lima bean leaves activate five separate defence genes when exposed to volatiles from conspecific leaves infested with T. urticae, but not when exposed to volatiles from artificially wounded leaves. The expression pattern of these genes is similar to that produced by exposure to jasmonic acid. At least three terpenoids in the volatiles are responsible for this gene activation; they are released in response to herbivory but not artificial wounding. Expression of these genes requires calcium influx and protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0305-1978(01)00048-5},
	abstract = {Field experiments with manually defoliated black alders (Alnus glutinosa) showed that defoliation affected herbivory by the major alder antagonist, the leaf beetle Agelastica alni. Herbivore damage increased with increasing distance to the defoliated tree, suggesting induced resistance not only on the damaged tree, but also on the neighbouring trees. The beetles also avoided leaves from the nearest neighbours for both feeding and oviposition in a laboratory assay, so the alders showed interplant resistance transfer. Natural enemies did not appear to shape this pattern, because the number of entomophagous arthropods and predator-prey ratios even increased with increasing distance to the defoliated tree. The numbers of all specialist, but not the generalist, herbivore species paralleled the increase in the attack of the specialist A. alni, supporting the view that specialists are more affected by plant resistance than generalists. Mechanisms causing this pattern, found in the field, were studied in more detail using biochemical analyses and further bioassays. Responses of alder leaves to herbivory of A. alni were shown to include ethylene emission and the release of a blend of volatiles with mono-, sesqui- and homoterpenes. Changes in leaf chemistry after herbivory included increases in the activity of oxidative enzymes (polyphenoloxidase, PPO, lipoxygenase, LOX, and peroxidase, POD) and proteinase inhibitors (PIs), and an increase in the phenolic contents of the leaves. Quantification of the endogenous jasmonic acid (JA) showed the activation of the octadecanoid pathway following herbivory. The active components in mediating a possible interplant signal transfer via airborne volatiles may have included ethylene, β-ocimene, 4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT), and 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT). The incubation with volatiles resulted in an increase in the activity of catalase (CAT) and PIs (after MeJA application) and in an increase in the content of phenolics and PI activity (after ethylene application). Further evidence that airborne interplant communication may be important in the response of alder trees to beetle attack came from container experiments. In airtight chambers, unattacked leaves significantly increased the activity of proteinase inhibitors when they were associated with leaves previously attacked by beetle larvae. In conclusion, field experiments, bioassays in the laboratory as well as biochemical analyses suggest the existence of interplant resistance transfer in A. glutinosa, with airborne volatiles as a possible mechanism. However, the relative importance of airborne and possible soil-borne signals as well as unknown effects of intensified nutrient absorption of defoliated trees, possibly reducing foliage quality of undamaged neighbours, remains to be shown. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The evidence for their defensive function originates mainly from laboratory studies with trained parasitoids and predators; the defensive function of these emissions for plants in natural settings has been rarely demonstrated. In native populations and laboratory Y-tube choice experiments with transgenic Nicotiana attenuata plants unable to release particular volatiles, we demonstrate that predatory bugs use terpenoids and green leaf volatiles (GLVs) to locate their prey on herbivore-attacked plants. By attracting predators with volatile signals, this native plant reduces its herbivore load - demonstrating the defensive function of herbivore-induced volatile emissions. However, plants producing GLVs are also damaged more by flea beetles. The implications of these conflicting ecological effects for the evolution of induced volatile emissions and for the development of sustainable agricultural practices are discussed.},

Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are emitted by plants upon damage but can be suppressed by herbivore-associated elicitors, and the abundance and composition of GLVs vary depending on the timing of herbivore attack. We show that the GLV biosynthetic enzyme HYDROPEROXIDE LYASE (HPL) is transcriptionally regulated by the circadian clock in Nicotiana attenuata. In accordance with transcript abundance of NaHPL, GLV aldehyde pools in intact leaves peaked at night and at subjective night under diurnal and continuous light conditions, respectively. Moreover, although the basal abundance of NaHPL transcripts is upregulated by jasmonate (JA) signaling, JA does not regulate the reduction of NaHPL transcript abundance in damaged leaves by simulated herbivore treatment. Unexpectedly, the plant circadian clock was strongly altered when Manduca sexta larvae fed on N. attenuata, and this was also independent of JA signaling. Lastly, the temporal dynamics of NaHPL transcripts and total GLV emissions were strongly altered by M. sexta larval feeding. Our data suggest that the temporal dynamics of emitted GLV blends result from a combination of damage, JA signaling, herbivore-associated elicitors, and the plant circadian clock. © 2018 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

Plant volatiles are used as signals by herbivores to medi-ate interactions between plants and herbivores. However, it is unclear whether climate warming will affect the volatile emissions of invasive plants, and subsequently alter the preferences of native herbivores. In this study, simulated warming experiments were conducted to investigate the preferences of a generalist moth, Spodoptera litura, and an oligophagous beetle, Cassida piperata, for the invasive plant species, Alternanthera philoxeroides, and the native species, Alternanthera sessilis. We found that elevated temperature altered the composition of the plant volatile emissions. Elevated temperature did not alter the behavioral preferences of S. litura and C. piperata to the invasive plant A. philoxeroides. However, elevated temperature indirectly increased the oviposition preference of the generalist moth to the native plant compared with the invasive plant. These results suggest that global warming might shift the oviposition preference of the generalist moth S. litura from an invasive plant to a native one, thereby potentially increasing damage to the native plants. These results are important for predicting alien plant invasions under future global warming scenarios. © 2020 E. Schweizerbart’sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, 70176 Stuttgart, Germany.},

	abstract = {Supplementation with Silicon (Si) is well-known for increasing resistance of grasses to insect herbivores. Although the exact underlying mechanism remains unknown, Si accumulation interacts with the jasmonic acid-signalling pathway, which modulates herbivore-induced plant defences. We examined whether Si supplementation alters direct and induced indirect defences in maize plants in ways that deter the initial infestation by the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (JE Smith). We assessed the herbivore’s oviposition preference, neonate and third-instar larval performance as well as the recruitment of a predator of young larvae, the flower bug Orius insidiosus (Say), by herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). In choice tests, S. frugiperda deposited about two times more eggs on −Si than on +Si maize. The mortality of neonate S. frugiperda larvae was about sixfold higher in +Si compared to −Si plants, even though they consumed similar leaf area on both treatments. Although there were no mortality differences, Si supplementation also impacted third-instar larvae that gained about twofold less weight than those fed on −Si maize. In olfactometer assays, O. insidiosus was not attracted to volatiles of uninfested maize plants with or without Si supplementation, but it was attracted to those emitted by fall armyworm-infested plants, irrespective of whether plants received Si supplementation. However, when the flower bug could choose between the volatiles released from −Si and +Si fall armyworm-infested plants, it preferentially oriented to +Si fall armyworm-infested plant. Our results show that Si supplementation in maize may deter fall armyworm colonization because of greater direct defences and attractiveness of HIPVs to the flower bug. © 2021, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.},

	abstract = {The most consumed and economically important beverage plant, tea (Camellia sinensis), and its pests have coevolved so as to maintain the plant–insect interaction. In this review, findings of different research groups on pest responsive tolerance mechanisms that exist in tea manifested through the production of secondary metabolites and their inducers are presented. The phytochemicals of C. sinensis have been categorized into volatiles, nonvolatiles, enzymes, and phytohormones for convenience. Two types of pests, namely the piercing-sucking pests and chewing pests, are associated with tea. Both the insect groups can trigger the production of those metabolites and inducers through several primary and secondary biosynthetic pathways. These induced biomolecules can act as insect repellents and most of them are associated with lowering the nutrient quality of plant tissue and increasing the indigestibility in the pest’s gut. Moreover, some of them also act as predator attractants of particular pests. The herbivore-induced plant volatiles secreted from tea plants during pest infestation were (E)-nerolidol, α-farnesene, (Z)-3-hexenol, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, indole, benzyl nitrile (BN), linalool, and ocimenes. The nonvolatiles like theaflavin and L-theanine were increased in response to the herbivore attack. Simultaneously, S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthase, caffeine synthase activities were affected, whereas flavonoid synthesis and wax formation were elevated. Defense responsive enzymes like peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, ascorbate peroxidase, and catalase are involved in pest prevention mechanisms. Phytohormones like jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, abscisic acid, and ethylene act as the modulator of the defense system. The objective of this review is to discuss the defensive roles of these metabolites and their inducers against pest infestation in tea with an aim to develop environmentally sustainable pesticides in the future. Key points • Herbivore-induced volatile signals and their effects on neighboring tea plant protection • Stereochemical conversion of volatiles, effects of nonvolatiles, expression of defense-responsive enzymes, and phytohormones due to pest attack • Improved understanding of metabolites for bio-sustainable pesticide development © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Many parasitoid species use olfactory cues to locate their hosts. In tritrophic systems, parasitoids of herbivores can exploit the chemical blends emitted by plants in reaction to herbivore-induced damage, known as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). In this study, we explored the specificity and innateness of parasitoid responses to HIPVs using a meta-analysis of data from the literature. Based on the concept of dietary specialization and infochemical use, we hypothesized that (i) specialist parasitoids (i.e., with narrow host ranges) should be attracted to specific HIPV signals, whereas generalist parasitoids (i.e., with broad host ranges) should be attracted to more generic HIPV signals and (ii) specialist parasitoids should innately respond to HIPVs, whereas generalist parasitoids should have to learn to associate HIPVs with host presence. We characterized the responses of 66 parasitoid species based on published studies of parasitoid behavior. Our meta-analysis showed that (i) as predicted, specialist parasitoids were attracted to more specific signals than were generalist parasitoids but, (ii) contrary to expectations, response innateness depended on a parasitoid's target host life stage rather than on its degree of host specialization: parasitoids of larvae were more likely to show an innate response to HIPVs than were parasitoids of adults. This result changes our understanding of dietary specialization and highlights the need for further theoretical research that will help clarify infochemical use by parasitoids. © 2017 The Authors.

	abstract = {Plants are at the trophic base of most ecosystems, embedded in a rich network of ecological interactions in which they evolved. While their limited range and speed of motion precludes animal-typical behavior, plants are accomplished chemists, producing thousands of specialized metabolites which may function to convey information, or even to manipulate the physiology of other organisms. Plants' complex interactions and their underlying mechanisms are typically dissected within the controlled environments of growth chambers and glasshouses, but doing so introduces conditions alien to plants evolved in natural environments, such as being pot-bound, and receiving artificial light with a spectrum very different from sunlight. The mechanistic understanding gained from a reductionist approach provides the tools required to query and manipulate plant interactions in real-world settings. The few tests conducted in natural ecosystems and agricultural fields have highlighted the limitations of studying plant interactions only in artificial environments. Here, we focus on three examples of known or hypothesized chemical mediators of plants' interactions: the volatile phytohormone ethylene (ET), more complex plant volatile blends, and as-yet-unknown mediators transferred by common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). We highlight how mechanistic knowledge has advanced research in all three areas, and the critical importance of field work if we are to put our understanding of chemical ecology on rigorous experimental and theoretical footing, and demonstrate function. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

However, to date, how plants receive volatiles and, consequently, how they fortify their defenses, is largely unknown. In this study, we found that undamaged tomato plants exposed to volatiles emitted by conspecifics infested with common cutworms (exposed plants) became more defensive against the larvae than those exposed to volatiles from uninfested conspecifics (control plants) in a constant airflow system under laboratory conditions. Comprehensive metabolite analyses showed that only the amount of (Z)-3-hexenylvicianoside (HexVic) was higher in exposed than control plants. This compound negatively affected the performance of common cutworms when added to an artificial diet. The aglycon of HexVic, (Z)-3-hexenol, was obtained from neighboring infested plants via the air. The amount of jasmonates (JAs) was not higher in exposed plants, and HexVic biosynthesis was independent of JA signaling. The use of (Z)-3-hexenol from neighboring damaged conspecifics for HexVic biosynthesis in exposed plants was also observed in an experimental field, indicating that (Z)-3-hexenol intake occurred even under fluctuating environmental conditions. Specific use of airborne (Z)-3-hexenol to form HexVic in undamaged tomato plants reveals a previously unidentified mechanism of plant defense.},

	abstract = {Sesquiterpenoids, with approximately 5,000 structures, are the most diverse class of plant volatiles with manifold hypothesized functions in defense, stress tolerance, and signaling between and within plants. These hypotheses have often been tested by transforming plants with sesquiterpene synthases expressed behind the constitutively active 35S promoter, which may have physiological costs measured as inhibited growth and reduced reproduction or may require augmentation of substrate pools to achieve enhanced emission, complicating the interpretation of data from affected transgenic lines. Here, we expressed maize (Zea mays) terpene synthase10 (ZmTPS10), which produces (E)-α-bergamotene and (E)-β-farnesene, or a point mutant ZmTPS10M, which produces primarily (E)-β-farnesene, under control of the 35S promoter in the ecological model plant Nicotiana attenuata. Transgenic N. attenuata plants had specifically enhanced emission of target sesquiterpene(s) with no changes detected in their emission of any other volatiles. Treatment with herbivore or jasmonate elicitors induces emission of (E)-α-bergamotene in wild- type plants and also tended to increase emission of (E)-α-bergamotene and (E)-β-farnesene in transgenics. However, transgenics did not differ from the wild type in defense signaling or chemistry and did not alter defense chemistry in neighboring wild-type plants. These data are inconsistent with within-plant and between-plant signaling functions of (E)-β-farnesene and (E)-α-bergamotene in N. attenuata. Ectopic sesquiterpene emission was apparently not costly for transgenics, which were similar to wild-type plants in their growth and reproduction, even when forced to compete for common resources. These transgenics would be well suited for field experiments to investigate indirect ecological effects of sesquiterpenes for a wild plant in its native habitat. © 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists.

AM fungi also enhance the attractiveness of plants to aphids via effects on emissions of plant volatiles used in aphid host location. We tested whether increased P uptake by plants is the mechanism through which AM fungi alter the volatile profile of plants and aphid behavioural responses by manipulating the availability of P and AM fungi to broad beans (Vicia faba L.) in a multi-factorial design. If AM fungi affect plant volatiles only via increased P acquisition, we predicted that the emission of volatiles and the attractiveness of mycorrhizal beans to aphids would be similar to those of non-mycorrhizal beans supplied with additional P. AM fungi and P addition increased leaf P concentrations by 40 and 24\%, respectively. The production of naphthalene was less in mycorrhizal plants, regardless of P addition. By contrast, production of (S)-linalool, (E)-caryophyllene and (R)-germacrene D was less in plants colonized by AM fungi but only in the absence of P additions. The attractiveness of plants to pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris) was positively affected by AM fungi and correlated with the extent of root colonization; however, attractiveness was neither affected by P treatment nor correlated with leaf P concentration. These findings suggest that increased P uptake is not the main mechanism by which mycorrhiza increase the attractiveness of plants to aphids. Instead, the mechanism is likely to operate via AM fungi-induced plant systemic signalling. © The Author 2014.},

	abstract = {In response to arthropod herbivory, plants release volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are attractive to natural enemies. Consequently, VOCs have been interpreted as co-evolved plant-natural enemy signals. This review argues that, while these data are necessary, they are not sufficient to demonstrate a VOC plant-natural enemy signaling function. We propose that evidence that (1) plant fitness is increased as a consequence of natural enemy recruitment, and either (2A) natural enemies preferentially learn prey-induced VOCs or (2B) natural enemies respond innately to the VOCs of the prey-host plant complex, is also required. Whereas there are too few studies to rigorously test hypotheses 1 and 2A, numerous studies are available to test hypothesis 2B. Of 293 tests of natural enemy responses to VOCs, we identified only 74 that were unambiguous tests of naïve natural enemies; in the remainder of the tests either natural enemies were experienced with their host in the presence of VOCs, or experience could not be ruled out. Of those 74 tests with naïve natural enemies, attraction was observed in 41 and not in 33. This review demonstrates that empirical support for the hypothesized VOC plant-natural enemy signaling function is not universal and presents alternative hypotheses for VOC production. © 2009 New Phytologist.},

Ovipositing females of the Egyptian cotton leaf worm, Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.)

In this study we investigate whether females of this moth can detect the herbivore-induced cotton volatiles. The response of female S. littoralis antennae to volatiles collected from cotton plants subjected to larval feeding was studied using GC-EAD (coupled gas chromatography electroantennographic-detection). By GC-EAD, responses to over 10 different cotton volatiles were observed. Using single sensillum technique the responses of short sensilla trichodea on the antennae of S. littoralis females to 19 cotton volatiles and 12 general plant volatiles were investigated. Responses to these volatiles were recorded from 108 receptor neurones. Several neurones activated by herbivore-induced cotton volatiles were recorded. For example, a neurone type responding to two homoterpenes [(E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene] and (E,E)-α-farnesene was frequently found. We also observed sensitive neurones responding specifically to the herbivore-induced volatiles (+/-)-linalool and indole. In general, a stimulus load of less than 1 ng was needed to activate these neurones. In addition, specific neurones were found for constitutive cotton volatiles released in connection with damage to the plant. An abundant neurone type responded to β-caryophyllene and α-humulene. Another neurone type responded specifically to the non-induced cotton volatile (Z)-jasmone.

It is often unknown which compounds in such a complex volatile blend represent the signal to the foraging carnivore. We studied the role of methyl salicylate (MeSA) as part of the volatile blend in the foraging behavior of the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis by using a Y-tube olfactometer. MeSA is one of the compounds released by lima bean, infested with Tetranychus urticae-a prey species of the predatory mite. MeSA attracted satiated predatory mites in a dose-dependent way with optimum attraction at a dose of 0.2 μg. Predatory mites did not discriminate between a prey-induced lima bean volatile blend (that contains MeSA) and a prey-induced volatile blend to which an extra amount of synthetic MeSA had been added. However, they preferred a MeSA-containing volatile blend (induced by T. urticae) to an otherwise similar but MeSA-free blend (induced by jasmonic acid). Adding synthetic MeSA to the MeSA-free blend significantly increased the mites' choice for this odor, suggesting an important role for MeSA. This study is a new step toward unraveling the role of herbivore-induced plant volatiles in the foraging behavior of predatory arthropods.},

(Annonaceae) includes eight species of shrubs and small trees, of which Asimina triloba has the broadest and northernmost distribution. We characterized the yeastlike fragrance of these flowers using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in natural populations in South Carolina. The odors of A. triloba and baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae shared ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and other compounds but differed in relative amounts of 3-methyl-1-butanol, 3-OH-2-butanone, and butane-2,3-diol. Immature green flowers of A. triloba produced sesquiterpenes common to the foliage of many plants. In contrast, sexually mature flowers emitted fermentation volatiles, with additional nitrogenous compounds (androgynoecium) and butanediols (outer corolla) emitted by male flowers. Some compounds were detected only when scent was sampled from at least 10 flowers. Chemical composition was more complex during day than night for immature and female flowers but not for males. Emission rates were fourfold greater in male than female flowers during the day but were comparable at night, perhaps because of overlapping gender expression. The yeasty odor of A. triloba is unusual in angiosperms and may serve to attract novel fly and beetle pollinators. © 2006 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The larva of codling moth Cydia pomonella (Tortricidae, Lepidoptera) is known as the worm in the apple, mining the fruit for food. We here show that codling moth larvae are closely associated with yeasts of the genus Metschnikowia. Yeast is an essential part of the larval diet and further promotes larval survival by reducing the incidence of fungal infestations in the apple. Larval feeding, on the other hand, enables yeast proliferation on unripe fruit. Chemical, physiological and behavioral analyses demonstrate that codling moth senses and responds to yeast aroma. Female moths are attracted to fermenting yeast and lay more eggs on yeast-inoculated than on yeast-free apples. An olfactory response to yeast volatiles strongly suggests a contributing role of yeast in host finding, in addition to plant volatiles. Codling moth is a widely studied insect of worldwide economic importance, and it is noteworthy that its association with yeasts has gone unnoticed. Tripartite relationships between moths, plants, and microorganisms may, accordingly, be more widespread than previously thought. It, therefore, is important to study the impact of microorganisms on host plant ecology and their contribution to the signals that mediate host plant finding and recognition. A better comprehension of host volatile signatures also will facilitate further development of semiochemicals for sustainable insect control.},

	abstract = {Glucosinolates (GSs) are sulfur-containing secondary metabolites characteristic of cruciferous plants [1, 2]. Their breakdown products, isothiocyanates (ITCs), are released following tissue disruption by insect feeding or other mechanical damages [3, 4]. ITCs repel and are toxic to generalist herbivores, while specialist herbivores utilize the volatile ITCs as key signals for localizing host plants [5, 6]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying detection of ITCs remain open. Here, we report that in the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella, a crucifer specialist, ITCs indeed drive the host preference for Arabidopsis thaliana, and the two olfactory receptors Or35 and Or49 are essential for this behavior. By performing gene expression analyses, we identified 12 (out of 59 in total) female-biased Ors, suggesting their possible involvement in oviposition choice. By ectopically expressing these Ors in Xenopus oocytes and screening their responses with 49 odors (including 13 ITCs, 25 general plant volatiles, and 11 sex pheromone components), we found that Or35 and Or49 responded specifically to three ITCs (iberverin, 4-pentenyl ITC, and phenylethyl ITC). The same ITCs also exhibited highest activity in electroantennogram recordings with female antennae and were the strongest oviposition stimulants. Knocking out either Or35 or Or49 via CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in a reduced oviposition preference for the ITCs, while double Or knockout females lost their ITC preference completely and were unable to choose between wild-type A. thaliana and a conspecific ITC knockout plant. We hence conclude that the ITC-based oviposition preference of the diamondback moth for its host A. thaliana is governed by the cooperation of two highly specific olfactory receptors.},

Olfaction plays an important role in perceiving volatile chemicals, utilizing them to locate host sites, conspecifics, and enemies. Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are present in high concentrations within the sensory sensilla of insects and are endowed with a heterogeneous range of functions. However, direct evidence for the involvement of CSPs in olfactory function is still lacking. In this study, a fluorescence-based ligand binding assay using Bdor-CSP2 illustrated its ability to bind the majority of the selected ligands of different shapes and chemical structures that are ecologically significant, host plant volatiles of Bactrocera dorsalis. RNAi-mediated silencing coupled with electrophysiological tests showed lower electrophysiological responses to (3Z)-hex-3-en-1-ol, trans-2-hexenal, 6-methylhept-5-en-2one, and 3-methylbutyl acetate in dsBdor CSP2 treated flies compared with the untreated controls. The reduced expression of Bdor-CSP2 by RNA interference was confirmed by semiquantitative PCR, real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot, which suggested the RNAi-treatment was responsible for the observed reduction of antennal responses in EAG recordings. These data suggest that the expression of BdorCSP2 is necessary for the recognition of antennal responses to some plant host volatiles by B. dorsalis.},

	abstract = {Plant volatiles play important roles in signalling between plants and insects, but their role in communication among plants remains controversial. Previous research on plant-plant communication has focused on interactions between neighbouring plants, largely overlooking the possibility that volatiles function as signals within plants. Here, we show that volatiles released by herbivore-wounded leaves of hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides x nigra) prime defences in adjacent leaves with little or no vascular connection to the wounded leaves. Undamaged leaves exposed to volatiles from wounded leaves on the same stem had elevated defensive responses to feeding by gypsy moth larvae (Lymantria dispar L.) compared with leaves that did not receive volatiles. Volatile signals may facilitate systemic responses to localized herbivory even when the transmission of internal signals is constrained by vascular connectivity. Self-signalling via volatiles is consistent with the short distances over which plant response to airborne cues has been observed to occur and has apparent benefits for emitting plants, suggesting that within-plant signalling may have equal or greater ecological significance than signalling between plants.},

	abstract = {Background: The detection of environmental cues and signals via the sensory system directs behavioral choices in diverse organisms. Insect larvae rely on input from the chemosensory system, mainly olfaction, for locating food sources. In several lepidopteran species, foraging behavior and food preferences change across larval instars; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying such behavioral plasticity during larval development are not fully understood. Here, we hypothesize that expression patterns of odorant receptors (ORs) change during development, as a possible mechanism influencing instar-specific olfactory-guided behavior and food preferences.Results: We investigated the expression patterns of ORs in larvae of the cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis between the first and fourth instar and revealed that some of the ORs show instar-specific expression. We functionally characterized one OR expressed in the first instar, SlitOR40, as responding to the plant volatile, beta-caryophyllene and its isomer alpha-humulene. In agreement with the proposed hypothesis, we showed that first but not fourth instar larvae responded behaviorally to beta-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene. Moreover, knocking out this odorant receptor via CRISPR-Cas9, we confirmed that instar-specific responses towards its cognate ligands rely on the expression of SlitOR40.Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that larvae of S. littoralis change their peripheral olfactory system during development. Furthermore, our data demonstrate an unprecedented instar-specific behavioral plasticity mediated by an OR, and knocking out this OR disrupts larval behavioral plasticity. The ecological relevance of such behavioral plasticity for S. littoralis remains to be elucidated, but our results demonstrate an olfactory mechanism underlying this plasticity in foraging behavior during larval development.},

	abstract = {Many insect herbivores engage in apparent competition whereby two species interact through shared natural enemies. Upon insect attack, plants release volatile blends that attract natural enemies, but whether these volatiles mediate apparent competition between herbivores is not yet known. We investigate the role of volatiles that are emitted by bean plants upon infestation by Acyrthosiphon pisum aphids on the population dynamics and fitness of Sitobion avenae aphids, and on wheat phloem sap metabolites. In a field experiment, the dynamics of S. avenae aphids on wheat were studied by crossing two treatments: exposure of aphid colonies to A. pisum-induced bean volatiles and exclusion of natural enemies. Glasshouse experiments and analyses of primary metabolites in wheat phloem exudates were performed to better understand the results from the field experiment. In the field, bean volatiles did not affect S. avenae dynamics or survival when aphids were exposed to natural enemies. When protected from them, however, volatiles led to larger aphid colonies. In agreement with this observation, in glasshouse experiments, aphid-induced bean volatiles increased the survival of S. avenae aphids on wheat plants, but not on an artificial diet. This suggests that volatiles may benefit S. avenae colonies via metabolic changes in wheat plants, although we did not find any effect on wheat phloem exudate composition. We report a potential case of associational susceptibility whereby plant volatiles weaken the defences of receiving plants, thus leading to increased herbivore performance.},

The DC responses recorded directly from the antennal sensilla and termed electrosensillograms (ESGs) were generally much larger (up to 14 mV) than electroantennogram (EAG) responses (up to 2.5 mV). Characteristic m orph-specific response profiles to these compounds were observed in each type of rhinarium and response waveforms were different between (E)-2-hexenal and the sex pheromone components. (E)-2-Hexenal elicited the largest responses at PPR, while nepetalactol and nepetalactone elicited the largest responses at SR in gynoparae and mates. Nepetatactol and nepetalactone also showed significant activities on DPR and PPR in all morphs. In contrast, (E)-2-hexenal had almost no activity oil SR. However, almost all of the SR investigated ill males and gynoparae were sensitive to both nepetalactol and nepetalactone. A small sub-set of male SR responded mainly to nepetalactol. SR of winged virginoparae did not respond to the sex pheromone compounds. Paraffin oil (the solvent control) also elicited significant responses at PPR in virginoparae but not in other morphs. In a further experiment, SR of winged virginoparae showed no response to 30 other plant volatile compounds or the alarm pheromone component, (E)-beta-farnesene. Nepetalactol and nepetalactone had similar dose-response profiles in the SR of gynoparae. The results indicate that SR in males and gynoparae are highly specialised to detect sex pheromone compounds, while the DPR and PPR are relatively broadly tuned to both plant volatiles and sex pheromone components. The presence of SR in winged virginoparae that are not responsive to sex pheromone components, alarm pheromone, or any of the plant volatile compounds tested may indicate a possible role of these sensilla to detect, as yet, unknown compound(s) with a high specificity. The present Study also Suggests that PPR may play a role in detecting paraffin-related compounds such as cuticular hydrocarbons of plants. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Ozone mixing ratios in suburbs are usually higher than in the center of cities and may reduce photosynthetic productivity at a relatively higher degree. Consequently, carbon-based defense capacities of plants may be suppressed by elevated O-3 more in the suburbs. However, contrary to this expectation, grazing damages by leaf beetles have been severe in some urban centers in comparison with the suburbs. To explain differences in grazing damages between urban areas and suburbs, the disruption of atmospheric communication signals by elevated O-3 via changes in plant-regulated biogenic volatile organic compounds and long-chain fatty acids are considered. The ecological roles of plant volatiles and the effects of O-3 from both a chemical and a biological perspective are presented. Ozone-disrupted plant volatiles should be considered to explain herbivory phenomena in urban and suburban systems.},

The book contains 12 individually-authored chapters. The first chapter discusses chemical ecology from a multidisciplinary approach, and chapter 2 considers chemical communication and the 5 major challenges in the postgenomics age. Topics covered in chapters 3-10 include, respectively: plant-insect interactions in the era of consolidation in biological sciences, with Nicotiana attenuata as an ecological expression system; the effect of host root-derived chemical signals on the germination of parasitic plants; chemical signaling between plants, and the mechanistic similarities between phytotoxic allelopathy and host recognition by parasitic plants; the chemosensory system of Caenorhabditis elegans and other nematodes; variation in learning of herbivory-induced plant odors by parasitic wasps; genetic and physiological techniques for studying odor coding in Drosophila; chemical communication between roots and shoots, and towards an integration in aboveground and belowground induced responses in plants; and food-web interactions in lakes and the impact of chemical information conveyance. Chapter 11 considers plant volatiles yielding new ways to exploit plant defence, and the twelfth and final chapter considers chemical ecology from genes to communities and integrating 'omics' with community ecology. The text is written in English. Each chapter is independently referenced. This book was written for scientists and students interested in ecology in general as well as those working in the fields of molecular, chemical, behavioral, population or community ecology.},

Induced defences have aspects common to all plants, whereas the accumulation of constitutive defences is species-specific. Insect herbivores activate induced defences both locally and systemically by signalling pathways involving systemin, jasmonate, oligogalacturonic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Plants also respond to insect attack by producing volatiles, which can be used to deter herbivores, to communicate between parts of the plant, or between plants, to induce defence responses. Plant volatiles are also an important component in indirect defence. Herbivorous insects have adapted to tolerate plant defences, and such adaptations can also be constitutive or induced. Insects whose plant host range is limited are more likely to show constitutive adaptation to the insecticidal compounds they will encounter, whereas insects which feed on a wide range of plant species often use induced adaptations to overcome plant defences. Both plant defence and insect adaptation involve a metabolic cost, and in a natural system most plant-insect interactions involving herbivory reach a 'stand-off' where both host and herbivore survive but develop suboptimally. © New Phytologist (2002).},

	abstract = {Plants display differential responses following mechanical damage and insect herbivory. Both caterpillar attack and the application of caterpillar oral secretions (OS) to wounded leaves stimulates volatile emission above mechanical damage alone. Volicitin (N-17-hydroxylinolenoyl-L-glutamine), present in beet armyworm (BAW, Spodoptera exigua ) OS, is a powerful elicitor of volatiles in excised maize seedlings (Zea mays cv. Delprim). We consider some of the mechanistic differences between wounding and insect herbivory in maize by examining the activity of volicitin, changes in jasmonic acid (JA) levels, and volatile emission from both intact plant and excised leaf bioassays. Compared to mechanical damage alone, volicitin stimulated increases in both JA levels and sesquiterpene volatiles when applied to intact plants. In a bioassay comparison, excised leaves were more sensitive and produced far greater volatile responses than intact plants following applications of both volicitin and JA. In the excised leaf bioassay, volicitin applications (10-500 pmol) to wounded leaves resulted in dose dependent JA increases and a direct positive relationship between JA and sesquiterpene volatile emission. Interestingly, volicitin-induced JA levels did not differ between intact and excised bioassays, suggesting a possible interaction of JA with other regulatory signals in excised plants. In addition to JA, insect herbivory is known to stimulate the production of ethylene. Significant increases in ethylene were induced only by BAW herbivory and not by either wounding or volicitin treatments. Using intact plant bioassays, ethylene (at 1 mul l(-1) or less) greatly promoted volatile emission induced by volicitin and JA but not mechanical damage alone. For intact plants, wounding, elicitor-induced JA and insect-induced ethylene appear to be important interacting components in the stimulation of insect-induced volatile emission.},

	abstract = {A plant-herbivore information “arms race” The consumption of plants by herbivores has driven the evolution of many diverse plant defense chemicals to which herbivores have constantly adapted. The transmission of chemical information at the community level is less known but important given the plethora of plant and herbivore species, especially in tropical communities. Zu et al. propose an information “arms race” approach to explain plant-herbivore chemical communication at the community level (see the Perspective by Solé). To test their conceptual framework, they used field data of herbivore-plant interactions and plant–volatile organic compound associations in a tropical dry forest. Their approach provides an understanding of the functioning and persistence of systems where individuals send and receive information in the form of signals to which other individuals react and, in turn, affect the behavior of other participants in these systems.

	url = {https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/385257},
	abstract = {The oxylipin pathway is commonly involved in induced plant defenses, and is the main signal-transduction pathway induced by insect folivory. Herbivory induces the production of several oxylipins, and consequently alters the so-called ‘oxylipin signature’ in the plant. Jasmonic acid (JA), as well as pathway intermediates are known to induce plant defenses. Indirect defense against herbivorous insects comprises the production of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). To unravel the precise oxylipin signal-transduction underlying the production of HIPVs in Arabidopsis thaliana and the resulting attraction of parasitoid wasps, we used a multidisciplinary approach that includes molecular genetics, metabolite analysis, and behavioral analysis. Mutant plants affected in the jasmonate pathway (18:0 and/or 16:0 -oxylipin routes; mutants dde2-2, fad5, opr3) were studied to assess the effects of JA and its oxylipin intermediates 12-oxo-phytodienoate (OPDA) and dinor-OPDA (dnOPDA) on HIPV emission and parasitoid (Diadegma semiclausum) attraction. Interference with the production of the oxylipins JA and OPDA altered the emission of HIPVs, in particular terpenoids and the phenylpropanoid methyl salicylate, which affected parasitoid attraction. Our data show that the herbivore-induced attraction of parasitoid wasps to Arabidopsis plants depends on HIPVs that are induced through the 18:0 oxylipin-derivative JA. Furthermore, our study shows that the 16:0-oxylipin route towards dnOPDA does not play a role in HIPV induction, and that the role of 18:0 derived oxylipin-intermediates, such as OPDA, is either absent or limited},

	url = {http://hdl.handle.net/10251/160001},
	abstract = {[EN] Recent metagenomic studies have provided an unprecedented wealth of data, which are revolutionizing our understanding of virus diversity. A redrawn landscape highlights viruses as active players in the phytobiome, and surveys have uncovered their positive roles in environmental stress tolerance of plants. Viral infectious clones are key tools for functional characterization of known and newly identified viruses. Knowledge of viruses and their components has been instrumental for the development of modern plant molecular biology and biotechnology. In this review, we provide extensive guidelines built on current synthetic biology advances that streamline infectious clone assembly, thus lessening a major technical constraint of plant virology. The focus is on generation of infectious clones in binary T-DNA vectors, which are delivered efficiently to plants by Agrobacterium. We then summarize recent applications of plant viruses and explore emerging trends in microbiology, bacterial and human virology that, once translated to plant virology, could lead to the development of virus-based gene therapies for ad hoc engineering of plant traits. The systematic characterization of plant virus roles in the phytobiome and next-generation virus-based tools will be indispensable landmarks in the synthetic biology roadmap to better crops. ; We are grateful to Catherine Mark for editorial assistance.

	url = {http://ir-library.ku.ac.ke/handle/123456789/10958},
	abstract = {Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, 85p. 2014, QP 517 .C45K8 ; The relationship between Pseudotheraptus wayi (cashew pest), Anacardium occidentale (Cashew plant), and Oecophylla longinoda (natural enemy) is a tritrophic interaction that is very important in cashew nut production. However, the chemical ecology of the interaction, specifically between the cashew plant and natural enemy as well as the pest and natural enemy was little investigated. Based on the hypothesis that both interactions were mediated by chemical signals, the objective of this study was to identify these signals and establish their relevance to the species in question. Head space volatiles of the cashew plant, the pest and natural enemy were collected, analyzed in Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), confirmed and quantified using authentic standards. Behavioral assays were then conducted to establish the relevance of the bio- chemicals. In the pestnatural enemy interaction, the volatiles identified were mainly C6 compounds (aldehyde, alcohol and the corresponding esters). Hexanal, hexanol, hexyl acetate and hexyl hexanoate were identified in the head space volatiles of the natural enemy as well as the pest. Moreover they were also present in the metathoracic glands of the pest which are primarily devoted to producing chemicals for defense purposes. Previously, these same compounds were shown to constitute the alarm pheromone of the natural enemy as well as defense chemicals of various insect species in the Coreidae family. In another study these four components were also suggested to constitute a candidate sex pheromone of the pest, corroborated in this study by the finding that, the onset and pattern of both mating and production of these chemicals coincide. In the host plant-natural enemy interaction, volatiles from plant parts most vulnerable to herbivory (leaves, fruit and inflorescence) were predominantly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. The attractiveness of the crude volatile extracts of the individual plant parts was measured as, total time spent by the natural enemy in either the test or control arm of the Y-tube olfactometer expressed as a percentage of the total time allocated .Crude volatile extracts from leaves and inflorescence were significantly attractive compared to the control (ttest, 0.=0.05) . However when the extracts were presented together with a food reward (sugar syrup) the responses of the natural enemy were significantly enhanced (ANOVA, a = 0.05). These fmdings demonstrate that while cashew volatiles are attractive to the natural enemy, they are most relevant when paired with a food reward; a response that is indicative of associative learning. Mirroring, these fmdings to the natural context suggests that, the natural enemy relies on cashew plant volatiles as predictors for food rewards. The rewards are usually nectar from extra floral nectaries located mainly on plant parts vulnerable to herbivory. Therefore, the rewards not only benefit the natural enemy but also confer an advantage to the plant, by motivating the natural enemy to spend more time around the vulnerable plant parts, effectively deterring herbivory. The wider implication is that the chemical signals identified in the interactions of the natural enemy with both the pest and plant can potentially be exploited for improved crop protection, ; Kenyatta University},

	title = {Variation in {Volatile} {Emission} in {Mimulus} guttatus and {Implications} for {Plant}-{Insect} {Interactions}},
	url = {https://dx.doi.org/10.18130/v3q063},
	abstract = {The volatile compounds emitted from plants function as key host-location cues for their insect visitors. Floral volatiles guide pollinators to nectar and pollen, and in turn, pollinators initiate plant reproduction, potentially promoting a mutualistic interaction. Constitutive and herbivore-induced foliar volatiles function as an important plant defense by deterring herbivores and attracting natural enemies of herbivores. Given the importance of plant volatiles in insect behavior, variation in volatile phenotypes is expected to affect insect visitation patterns, and consequently, plant reproductive success and susceptibility to herbivores. Inbreeding is an important source of genetic variation that it is extremely common in natural populations of flowering plants. Since inbreeding increases homozygosity, inbreeding could increase expression of recessive alleles that disrupt biosynthesis of volatile compounds. In previous work, inbreeding in the mixed-mating herb Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyflower) decreased pollinator attraction and resistance to herbivory. However, the plant traits underlying these effects are unknown. This dissertation examined the effects of inbreeding on the floral and foliar volatile phenotypes of M. guttatus and the consequences of these effects for its pollinators and herbivores. The first chapter of this dissertation investigates floral volatile profiles from experimentally inbred and outbred M. guttatus. Since olfactory cues are known to signal the quality of floral rewards, and since inbreeding in M. guttatus is known to reduce the quantity and quality of pollen (its only floral reward), it also investigates whether the floral volatile profile is associated with pollen rewards. Results demonstrated that inbreeding reduced emission of a sesquiterpene, β-trans-bergamotene. Six monoterpenes were positively associated with pollen rewards in M. guttatus, but there was no overlap between compounds exhibiting inbreeding effects and compounds associated with pollen rewards. The second chapter of this dissertation examines the foraging behavior of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) in response to β-trans-bergamotene and compounds correlated with pollen rewards. Behavioral assays demonstrated that bumblebees are innately attracted to β-bergamotene. Moreover, after foraging on M. guttatus, bumblebees learned to prefer floral odors correlated with pollen rewards. However, bumblebees were only able to base foraging decisions on associative learning when presented floral scents that did not contain β-bergamotene, suggesting that its innate attractive properties could interfere with learned olfactory signals. The third chapter of this dissertation investigates the effects of inbreeding and herbivory on foliar volatile emission in M. guttatus. Results demonstrated that herbivory significantly increased foliar volatile emission. In particular, herbivory increased emission of 1-octen-3-ol and neophytadiene, compounds that are known to function as indirect and direct defenses, respectively. This study also found an interaction between inbreeding and herbivory in the overall volatile profile, and that inbreeding reduced constitutive emission of individual components of the volatile blend. The fourth chapter of this dissertation examines performance and preferences of a generalist herbivore, Helicoverpa zea, and a specialist, Junonia coenia, in response to inbreeding and trichome density in M. guttatus. Results demonstrated that H. zea developed most efficiently on inbred plants with low trichome density, but did not exhibit a preference for inbred versus outbred plants. Junonia coenia performed best on outbred plants with low trichome density, and consistently preferred outbred over inbred plants, even when presented only olfactory cues. Both species consumed more leaf tissue in outbred plants, suggesting that inbred plants could have an advantage in defending against herbivores. This dissertation is one of only a few studies to examine effects of inbreeding on plant volatile profiles, and it is the first study to demonstrate that innate olfactory preferences of bumblebees can override learned preferences for floral scents. It is also among the first to differentiate the responses of specialist and generalist herbivores to inbreeding effects in their host. The findings in this dissertation enhance our understanding of the ecology and evolution of plant-insect interactions, which can have important implications for the evolution of plant mating systems and the vulnerability of small populations.},

	abstract = {Floral volatiles play a major role in plant-insect communication. We examined the influence of two volatiles, phenylacetaldehyde and a-pinene, on the innate and learnt foraging behaviour of the moth Helicoverpa armigera. In dual-choice wind tunnel tests, adult moths flew upwind towards both volatiles, with a preference for phenylacetaldehyde. When exposure to either of these volatiles was paired with a feeding stimulus (sucrose), all moths preferred the learnt odour in the preference test. This change in preference was not seen when moths were exposed to the odour without a feeding stimulus. The learnt preference for the odour was reduced when moths were left unfed for 24 h before the preference test. We tested whether moths could discriminate between flowers that differed in a single volatile component. Moths were trained to feed on flowers that were odour-enhanced using either phenylacetaldehyde or a-pinene. Choice tests were then carried out in an outdoor flight cage, using flowers enhanced with either volatile. Moths showed a significant preference for the flower type on which they were trained. Moths that were conditioned on flowers that were not odour-enhanced showed no preference for either of the odour-enhanced flower types. The results imply that moths may be discriminating among odour profiles of individual flowers from the same species. We discuss this behaviour within the context of nectar foraging in moths and odour signalling by flowering plants.},

	url = {https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:331751},
	abstract = {Herbivore-induced changes in plants have been widely viewed as defensive responses against further insect attack. However, changes in plants as a consequence of herbivore feeding can elicit various responses in herbivores; these are variable, context dependent, and often unpredictable. In this laboratory study, the responses of Thrips tabaci Lindeman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) to volatiles emitted by intact and herbivore-damaged or mechanically damaged cotton seedlings [Gossypium hirsutum L. (Malvaceae)] were investigated in dual-choice olfactometer assays. Thrips tabaci showed increased attraction to seedlings subject to foliar mechanical damage and those with foliar damage inflicted by conspecifics or Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), upon which it preys. However, T.tabaci did not discriminate between intact seedlings and those with foliar damage inflicted by Helicoverpa armigera Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), two other species of thrips, Frankliniella schultzei Trybom and Frankliniella occidentalis Pergrande (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), or those with root damage inflicted by Tenebrio molitor L. (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Attraction of T.tabaci was also affected by herbivore density on damaged plants. That is, seedlings damaged by higher densities of T.urticae or T.tabaci were more attractive than seedlings damaged by lower densities of the corresponding arthropod. Although attracted to plants damaged by conspecifics or T.urticae, T.tabaci showed greater attraction to seedlings damaged by T.urticae than to seedlings damaged by conspecifics. Results are discussed in the context of the responses of F.schultzei and F.occidentalis to herbivore-induced cotton seedlings, highlighting the complexity, variability, and unpredictability of the responses of even closely related species of insects to plants under herbivore attack.},

	url = {https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/427335},
	abstract = {Plants induce a suite of direct and indirect responses after herbivore attack. For utilizing these plant attributes in agriculture, it is important to compare the relative importance of these two defence types in the same plant species. Precise timing of these responses is vital for their effect on the herbivores feeding on the plant. In my thesis, I present an analysis of the temporal dynamics of various direct and indirect responses in Indian/ Brown mustard, Brassica juncea due to herbivory by a generalist Spodoptera spp, a specialist Plutella xylostella or both of these herbivores together. Morphological (leaf size and trichome densities) and chemical (volatiles, glucosinolates, amino acids, sugars) responses were analysed over temporal range of 24 hours to 20 days. The effect of direct systemic responses was assessed using a specialist (Plutella xylostella) and a generalist (Spodoptera litura) herbivore. In addition, to investigate indirect responses, orientation experiments were conducted on the generalist (Cotesia marginiventris) and specialist (C. plutellae) parasitoids. Results were validated with analysis of genes involved in signalling and biosynthetic pathways that govern the expression of these responses. For the first time, the presence of extrafloral nectar (EFN) in Brassicaceae is being reported. Their sugar and amino acid contents were measured in five different varieties of B. juncea. The indirect function of these EFN droplets was assessed by testing their inducibility and attraction and survival of parasitoids on them. These studies thus show that although morphological responses are slower than chemical responses, they also contribute to induced plant resistance in a relatively short time span. Moreover, before considering induced responses as resistance factors, their effect should be assessed at different points in time with both generalist and specialist herbivores.},

	url = {https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI10748464},
	abstract = {Top-down pressure from parasites is thought to be a key driver in herbivore diet breath, but studies investigating the evolution of food plant shifts as a defense against natural enemies in the environment are still lacking in the literature. I examined how plants alter insect-enemy interactions for a specialist herbivore utilizing solanaceous food plants, Manduca sexta (the tobacco hornworm) and the parasitoid wasp, Cotesia congregata, as a model. In this study, I documented parasite infections in a field population of M. sexta, and then investigated from an eco-immunological perspective how plant toxins influence susceptibility to parasites in order to explain food plant choice. My research demonstrates that M. sexta exhibits a negative preference-performance relationship with plants in the Solanaceae. This is likely to gain protection from parasitoid attack via direct and indirect effects from plants on herbivore physiology. I show that herbivores are unpalatable and toxic to natural enemies when they consume more noxious host plants, but also provide a subsequent explanation for the adaptive value and maintenance of this interaction; specific plant secondary metabolites alter herbivore immune activity, where for M. sexta nicotine demonstrates immunotherapeutic properties by enhancing this insect’s phenoloxidase activity. I also examined phenotypic plasticity in caterpillar immune responses to nonlethal cues from natural enemies. Upon studying non-consumptive effects of natural enemies on M. sexta in the presence of C. congregata and the spined soldier bug, Podisus maculiventris, my work suggests that M. sexta generally accelerates their development in the presence of natural enemies at the cost of some immune defenses, implying a resource allocation tradeoff to physiological development and immunity. Placed within a community level context, M. sexta can mitigate the consumptive and nonconsumptive effects parasitoids have on this herbivore’s physiology by utilizing a food resource in parasite burdened habitats that increases direct resistance to parasites and also improves immune activity, even at the cost of development. Following this, I investigated the consequences of crop domestication on plant-insect-parasitoid interaction via changes in plant traits for direct defense against herbivores and altered plant volatile signaling of natural enemies. I demonstrated that domesticated chili peppers showed no loss of plant direct defenses to M. sexta compared to wild peppers and that crop peppers had increased attraction and efficiency of parasitoids. This highlighted the context-dependent nature domestication has on trophic interactions and emphasizes the need for dedicated investigation in each unique crop system.},

	abstract = {[EN] Orius laevigatus is a generalist predator that is widely used in augmentative strategies against the key pest of sweet pepper, Frankliniella occidentalis. Despite being a zoophytophagous predator, the phytophagous behavior of O. laevigatus has not been previously explored in depth nor has the impact of phytophagy on plant physiology. Here, the hierarchical significance of O. laevigatus feeding on sweet pepper is compared with other behaviors. O. laevigatus spends the majority of its time (38\%) feeding on apical meristems and apical fresh leaves, which were also preferred residence locations. Here, the phytophagous feeding behavior of O. laevigatus on sweet pepper is shown to trigger defensive responses in the plant. These O. laevigatus plant-induced defenses are then shown to contribute to the repellence or attraction of pests or natural enemies, respectively. Specifically, O. laevigatus-punctured sweet pepper plants induce repellency for the whitefly Bemisia tabaci and the thrips species F. occidentalis. In contrast, the whitefly parasitoid Encarsia formosa was significantly attracted to O. laevigatus-punctured plants. The plant responses to O. laevigatus punctures include the release of an altered blend of volatiles and activation of the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signalling pathways. These results highlight an interesting facet to the biology of O. laevigatus, in which the ability of the predator to induce defensive responses in sweet pepper plants may serve to improve the biological control of both thrips and whiteflies. ; The research leading to these results was partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (AGL2014-55616-C3) and the Conselleria d'Agricultura, Pesca i Alimentacio de la Generalitat Valenciana.

	abstract = {Plant–animal interaction systems are complex food webs where the members—plants, pollinators, herbivores, parasites and predators of the pollinators/herbivores—interact with each other in ways which maximize their own fitness. Based on the net outcome, such interactions could be mutually beneficial to the interacting members (mutualism) or beneficial to only one of the interacting members at the cost of the other interacting members (herbivory, predation, parasitism). It is possible that such outcomes are actually a continuum and could swing in either direction from beneficial to detrimental and vice versa. Such transitions happen not only over long time scales, but could also happen within shorter time scales based on conditionalities. Conditional outcomes are those in which the outcome of an interaction between two partners is conditional on the involvement of a third partner. Thus, studying such outcomes necessitates taking into account systems beyond the classical two-partner interactions. In such complex multitrophic plant–animal interaction systems in which there are direct and indirect interactions between species, comprehending the dynamics of these multiple partners is very important for an understanding of how the system is structured. In Chapter 2 we investigate Ficus racemosa and its community of obligatory mutualistic and parasitic ﬁg wasps that develop within the fig inﬂorescence or syconium, as well as their interaction with opportunistic ants. We focus on temporal resource partitioning among members of the ﬁg wasp community over the development cycle of the fig syconia during which wasp oviposition and development occur and we study the activity rhythm of the ants associated with this community. We found that the members of the wasp community partitioned their oviposition across fig syconium development phenology and showed interspecific variation in activity across the diel cycle. The wasps presented a distinct sequence in their arrival at fig syconia for oviposition. We documented night oviposition in several fig wasp species for the first time. Ant activity on the fig syconia was correlated with wasp activity and was dependent on whether the ants were predatory or trophobiont-tending species; only numbers of predatory ants increased during peak arrivals of the wasps. In Chapter 3, we found that predatory ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) patrolling F. racemosa trees were attracted to the odour from fig syconia at different developmental phases, as well as to the odours of fig wasps, whereas other predatory ants (Technomyrmex albipes) responded only to odours of syconia from which ﬁg wasps were dispersing and to ﬁg wasp odour. However, trophobiont-tending ants (Myrmicaria brunnea) patrolling the same trees and exposed to the same volatiles were unresponsive to ﬁg or ﬁg wasp odours. The predatory ants demonstrated a concentration-dependent response towards volatiles from figs receptive to pollinators and those from which wasps were dispersing while the trophobiont-tending ants were unresponsive to such odours at all concentrations. Naıve predatory ants failed to respond to the volatiles to which the experienced predatory ants responded, indicating that the response to ﬁg-related odours is learned. In Chapter 4 we characterise the dynamics of the volatile bouquet of the ﬁg syconium from the initiation through pre-receptive, receptive, and late inter-ﬂoral stages which act as signals/ cues for different ﬁg wasp species. We were also interested in diel patterns of volatile emission as some ﬁg wasp species were strictly diurnal (the pollinator, Ceratosolen fusciceps) whereas other ﬁg wasps such as Apocryptophagus fusca were observed ovipositing even during the nocturnal hours. We identified volatiles that were specific to syconium development phase as well as to the time of day in this bouquet. α-muurolene was identified as the sesquiterpene specific to receptive-phase as well as being present only during the day thus coinciding with the diurnal pollinator arrival pattern. Volatiles such as (E)-β-ocimene were present in increasing levels across the developmental stages of the ﬁg and thus could act as background volatiles providing suitable information to fig wasps about host plants and their phases. Chapter 5 examines the responses of predatory and trophobiont-tending ant species to the cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) extracts of four galler and two parasitoid ﬁg wasp species associated with F. racemosa. Interestingly, the antennation response of both experienced and na¨ıve ants to these wasp extracts was identical indicating that prior exposure to such compounds is not necessary for eliciting such response. We also characterised these cuticular hydrocarbon extracts to find potential compounds which could as short-range cues for predatory ants. Ants were more responsive to the cuticular extracts of parasitoids rather than to those of galler wasps, implying that the CHC profile of carnivorous prey may contain more elicitors of aggressive behaviour in ants compared to herbivorous prey whose profiles may be more similar to those of their plant resources. We also find congruency between the cuticular profiles of parasitoids and their hosts suggesting that parasitoids could sequester compounds from their diet. Important findings and conclusions of the thesis are presented in Chapter 6. The first two parts of the appendices section discuss work carried out on alternative ways of analysing multivariate data sets such as plant volatiles and insect cuticular hydrocarbons. Appendix A details the use of Random Forests, an algorithm-based method of analysing complex data sets where there are more variables than samples, a situation akin to microarray data sets. This work illustrates the use of such techniques in chemical ecology, highlighting the potential pitfalls of classical multivariate tests and the advantages of newer more robust methods. Appendix B, an invited article following the publication of the earlier work, compares different data transformation procedures currently employed in such multivariate analysis. Appendix C details sex-specific differences in cuticular hydrocarbons of fig wasps, using the pollinator C. fusciceps as a case study.},

	abstract = {O ataque de insetos herbívoros induz a emissão de voláteis pelas plantas que constituem sinais químicos importantes para os inimigos naturais em busca do hospedeiro/presa. Essas interações tritróficas mediadas pelos voláteis das plantas têm sido bem estudadas em sistemas que envolvem parasitóides larvais. Por outro lado, pouco se sabe a respeito do papel desses odores na localização hospedeira dos parasitóides de ovos. Dessa maneira, o presente estudo teve como objetivos: (i) avaliar o parasitismo, a preferência e o arrestamento de ovos de Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) de diferentes idades para o parasitóide Telenomus remus Nixon (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae); (ii) verificar se ocorre a indução de voláteis induzidos pela oviposição de S. frugiperda na planta de milho atraentes ao parasitóide T. remus; (iii) avaliar o papel dos voláteis induzidos pela herbivoria de S. frugiperda no comportamento do parasitóide especialista T. remus e generalista Trichogramma pretiosum Riley (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae); e (iv) verificar se a oviposição de S. frugiperda altera as defesas diretas e indiretas induzidas pela herbivoria no milho. Os resultados desse trabalho mostraram que T. remus teve preferência em parasitar ovos de 1 e 2 dias de idade em relação aos 3 dias. Entretanto, a emergência dos parasitóides foi reduzida em ovos de 2 e 3 dias. Todos os extratos hexânicos dos ovos exerceram efeito arrestante sobre T. remus em relação ao solvente, porém o tempo de permanência dos parasitóides foi maior em extratos de ovos de 1 e 2 dias em comparação ao de 3 dias. De acordo com esses resultados, foi avaliado se a planta de milho emite voláteis induzidos pela oviposição de S. frugiperda atraentes ao parasitóide T. remus nos intervalos 1, 2 e 3 dias. Os bioensaios comportamentais e a coleta de voláteis não mostraram que ocorre a indução de voláteis induzidos pela oviposição atraentes ao parasitóide, mas que a oviposição promoveu a supressão da emissão do linalol. Já os voláteis induzidos pela herbivoria do S. frugiperda constituem pistas químicas importantes para os parasitóides de ovos. O parasitóide especialista T. remus não apresentou o comportamento inato de atração pelos voláteis, porém, após a experiência com os mesmos, T. remus passou a ser atraído tanto por misturas compostas majoritariamente por voláteis de folhas verdes (VFVs), que são emitidas logo após o dano; como por misturas mais complexas, compostas por terpenos, emitidas algumas horas após a indução. Já T. pretiosum apresentou um comportamento de atração inato pelos VFVs, embora seja também capaz de aprender misturas compostas por terpenos. A oviposição de S. frugiperda não alterou as defesas diretas do milho, avaliadas pelo peso da lagarta alimentada na planta, porém, provocou a diminuição da liberação de terpenos induzidos pela herbivoria. Os resultados desse trabalho sugerem que a oviposição do herbívoro pode ter implicações relevantes nas interações tritróficas, pois promovem a supressão de voláteis do milho. Além disso, os voláteis induzidos pela herbivoria desempenham um papel importante no comportamento de parasitóides de ovos. ; Attack of insect herbivores induces emission of plant volatiles that play an important role as chemical signals to natural enemies in host search. Tritrophic interactions mediated by plant volatiles have been well studied in systems that involve larval parasitoids. By contrast, little is known about the role of these odors in host searching by egg parasitoids. Thus, the current study aimed to: (i) assess parasitism, preference and arrestment of Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) eggs with different ages to the parasitoid Telenomus remus Nixon (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae); (ii) verify if S. frugiperda oviposition induces attractive maize volatiles to the parasitoid T. remus; (iii) assess the role of herbivore-induced maize volatiles elicited by S. frugiperda to the specialist parasitoid T. remus and the generalist Trichogramma pretiosum Riley (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae); and (iv) verify if S. frugiperda oviposition alters direct and indirect herbivore-induced defenses on maize. Results showed that T. remus preferred to parasitize 1- and 2-day-old eggs in relation to 3-day-old. However, parasitoid emergence was reduced in 2- and 3-day-old eggs. All hexanic egg extracts promoted arrestment response for T. remus when compared to the solvent, although residence time was longer in 1- and 2-day old egg extracts in comparison with 3-day old. In view of these results, it was assessed if maize plant emits attractive oviposition-induced volatiles elicited by S. frugiperda to the egg parasitoid T. remus. Behavioral bioassays and volatile collection did not show that maize emits oviposition-induced volatiles elicited by S. frugiperda that are attractive to T. remus. Surprisingly, oviposition suppressed the emission of linalool. Hebivore-induced maize volatiles comprise important chemical cues for egg parasitoids. Specialist parasitoid T. remus was not innately attracted by herbivore-induced volatiles, though experienced wasps responded to blends comprised predominantly by green leaf volatiles (GLVs), which are emitted immediately after damage, or to more complex blends comprised by terpenes, emitted some hours after damage. While T. pretiosum showed an innate behavior towards VFVs, but wasps were also able to learn terpene blend. Oviposition of S. frugiperda did not alter direct defenses on maize, which were assessed by larval weight fed on the plant, however, it decreased emissions of herbivore-induced terpenes. These results suggest that herbivore oviposition can have relevant considerations in tritrophic interactions and herbivore-induced volatiles play an important role in egg parasitoid behavior.},

	url = {https://hdl.handle.net/10182/10762},
	abstract = {Most species of insects are selective feeders that not only choose the plant but also choose specific plant organs. Insect host-finding behaviour involves several cues such as olfactory, visual, tactile and gustatory. The responses to these cues depend on the context in which the signals are perceived and on the host-insect system. Knowing the process of host-finding behaviour of insects is important for management practices. The oligophagous, chrysomelid beetle Cassida rubiginosa was introduced to New Zealand in 2007 mainly to control Cirsium arvense (Californian thistle), one of the most noxious weeds found in the world. New Zealand does not have any native thistles and very few economically important ones. Therefore, there is potential for using this beetle to target secondary weeds and to better manage the beetle for weed biocontrol. Host selection behaviour of the beetle was investigated by conducting experiments in a phylogenetic context giving emphasis to chemical cues. Host range was investigated for constitutive volatiles as well as induced volatiles. Host-range testing with constitutive volatiles was conducted by using 19 Asteraceae plants (16 Cardueae and 3 non-Cardueae) which were selected according to phylogeny. A series of single-choice and dual-choice olfactometer experiments and adult host-choice experiments were carried out investigating the beetles’ choice of constitutive volatiles. Adult host-choice experiments were performed to test the feeding and oviposition preference of the beetle. Volatiles were induced by conspecific larval damage and 13 Cardueae plant species were used. Using induced volatiles, the differential attraction of C. rubiginosa in olfactometer experiments comparing undamaged leaves with conspecific larval damaged leaves was investigated. Volatiles were collected and analysed using GC-MS. Compatibility of the beetle can change according to other biocontrol agents. Investigations were carried out with two fungal pathogens (Puccinia punctiformis and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) infesting C. arvense by studying the olfactory behaviour of adult C. rubiginosa towards fungus-infected C. arvense. A series of olfactometer experiments were conducted to evaluate the host selection of the beetle; dual-choice experiments were performed to investigate its feeding preference. Adult beetles were given the choice between healthy thistle leaves and leaves infected by one of the pathogens. Volatiles were collected from healthy and fungus-infected plants and analysed using GC-MS. The multi-targeting biocontrol potential of C. rubiginosa was tested with marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre), a species closely related to the primary host and shown to be equally preferred in previous experiments. To test if the beetle can reduce the fitness of marsh thistle a potted plant experiment was established with four treatments (0, 50, 100 and 200 larvae/plant). Plant growth (width, height and number of branches) and reproductive performance (number of flowers, seeds, seed weight and \% germination) parameters were measured. The results show that as phylogenetic distance from the primary host plant increases, the beetles’ preference for alternative hosts decreases. This was the case for all three parameters: olfactory choice for constitutive volatiles, feeding and oviposition preference. Olfactory experiments showed similar host range to host-choice experiments across the Cardueae tribe. When presented with herbivore-induced volatiles (HIPVs) the beetle increased attraction towards five hosts that it was not attracted to when tested with constitutive volatiles. Chemical compounds such as cis-β-ocimene and β-caryophyllene were detected in the HIPVs blend in the five species of plants that showed beetle attraction, expanding the olfactory host range of the beetle. However, the beetles’ attraction towards C. arvense was reduced when infected with the biotrophic rust fungus P. punctiformis while the necrotroph S. sclerotiorum had no effect. Both pathogens, however, reduced adult beetle leaf consumption. Volatile profiles showed a unique blend of compounds where the P. punctiformis-infected thistle leaves were characterised by the emission of benzenoids and indole, S. sclerotiorum-infected leaves by green leaf volatiles. Thus, having multiple biocontrol agents can reduce the efficacy of at least one of the involved agents and should be taken into consideration. The multi-targeting potential of the beetle is predicted to follow the phylogenetic trend in host preference. As such, the greatest multi-targeting potential is likely for the equally preferred species, particularly the Cirsium and Carduus genera. Though the beetle was found to be equally attracted to C. palustre in all of the experiments, it did not show an effect in reducing C. palustre individual plant growth or reproductive performance under the imposed experimental conditions. If the beetle is to have an impact on other thistle weeds, it will likely need to attack early growth stages (seedlings), or smaller size classes of plants to prevent reproduction.},

Biol. (Ranking: 16/188) 刊出。本計畫的目的是要研究探討植物揮發性相剋化合物作用模式及水稻及菸草抵抗植物相剋化合物的防禦反應及對植物多樣性之影響。我們將測定抗氧化酵素及蛋白激酶的活性並使用微陣列技術 (DNA microarray) 證實植物相剋化合物有機揮發物質逆境反應下2 個栽培水稻品系 (1 種粳稻, 台農67 號; 1 種秈稻, 台中在來一號)，台灣野生稻及菸草的訊息傳遞途徑及生物作用。轉錄豐度 (transcript abundance) 的改變將可使用即時定量PCR 針對所選擇的候選基因進行驗證。為了進一步找出單子葉或雙子葉對植物揮發性相剋化合物的專一性的反應途徑，我們進行GO 基因功能分析 (Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis)。除此之外，植物揮發性相剋化合物誘導基因的基因表達差異之演化速率將可從檢測40 種栽培品系的水稻 (20 種粳稻及20 種秈稻栽培種) 及20 種亞洲野生稻獲得。為了測定這些基因表現的差異 (栽培稻與野生稻及栽培稻與菸草) 是否提供外表型上的差異，我們將使用含有植物揮發性相剋化合物誘導基因之基因剔除、轉殖水稻植物及病毒誘導基因靜默法之菸草來進一步研究個別基因對於植物多樣性及生態上的影響。 ; Allelopathy plays an important role in ecosystem. In plants, allelochemical can be found in the roots, root exudates, stems, leaves, bark, flowers, and fruits. It is a generally accepted definition that allelochemicals released by donor plants into the environment by leaching and volatilization from plant foliage, exudation from roots, and from decomposition of dead plant residues, causing detrimental effects on the growth and development of receiver plants. Thus, allelochemicals have been shown to play roles in the determination of plant diversity. In our previous study, we disclosed the molecular mode of action of allelochemical juglone [published in Plant Mol. Biol. (2011) (Impact factor: 4.149; Ranking: 16/188)] . Among allelochemicals, plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been proposed to be one of the potent germination and growth inhibitors of several plants. VOCs can also elicit responses in neighbouring plants, thus constituting a platform for plant–plant interactions. Inter- and intra-species chemical recognition and information transfer may occur among plants. The evidence of allelochemical VOCs functioning in plant communities is lacking. Monoterpenes, the major components of essential oils, enter the atmosphere by foliar release from forests and vegetation or by leaching from litter and foliar parts and even through root exudation. Chou and Lin (1976) reported that decrease in plant productivity of the second rice crop in a paddy field containing rice residues from the first rice crop. Volatile toxic compounds are thought to be present in the decomposing rice residues in soil (Chou and Lin, 1976). The growth inhibitor monoterpene was also found in root exudates of rice. The role of the antioxidant and signalling system in the plant in response to biotic and abiotic stresses has received wide attention. However, the role of the antioxidant enzymes and signalling components in response to allelopathic agents is very limited. The aim of this project is to understand the mode of action of allelochemical VOCs and defense responses mounted against allelochemicals in rice and tobacco plants, In particular, using microarrays, we will identify interlinked signalling pathways and biological processes in response to allelochemical VOCs stress in 2 lines of the domesticated rice (1 japonica, TNG67, and 1 indica, TN1, cultivar), one line of O. rufipogon from Asia and tobacco. Changes in the transcript abundance will be validated for a selection of candidate genes using quantitative real-time PCR. In an attempt to identify novel and allelochemical stress regulated miRNAs and siRNAs, we will use a deep sequencing approach developed by Solexa/Illumina Inc. We will sequence small RNA libraries prepared from rice seedlings exposed to allelochemical VOCs. Furthermore, the rates of expression profile and coding sequence evolution in allelochemical VOCs-induced genes between domesticated-wild rice orthologous gene pairs will be examined in 40 lines of the domesticated rice (20 japonica and 20 indica cultivars) and twenty lines of O. rufipogon from Asia. To determine whether these expression differences may contribute phenotypic variation, T-DNA knock out, transgenic rice plants and VIGS in Nicotiana benthamiana with allelochemical-induced genes will be used to investigate the effects of individual genes on plant biodiversity and ecological interactions.},

	abstract = {Olfactory cues constitute one of the most important plant-pollinator communication channels. Specific chemical components can be associated with specific pollinator functional groups due to pollinator-mediated selection on flower volatile (FV) emission. Here, we used multivariate analyses of FV data to detect an association between FVs and the worldwide distributed pollinator group of the carpenter bees (Xylocopa spp.). We compiled FVs of 29 plant species: 9 pollinated by carpenter bees, 20 pollinated by other bee pollinator functional groups. We tested whether FV emission differed between these groups. To rule out any phylogenetic bias in our dataset, we tested FV emission for phylogenetic signal. Finally, using field assays, we tested the attractive function of two FVs found to be associated with carpenter bees. We found no significant multivariate difference between the two plant groups FVs. However, seven FVs (five apocarotenoid terpenoids, one long-chain alkane and one benzenoid) were significantly associated with carpenter bee pollination, thus being “predictor” compounds of pollination by this pollinator functional group. From those, β-ionone and (E)-methyl cinnamate presented the highest indicator values and had their behavioural function assessed in field assays. Phylogenetic signal for FVs emission was weak, suggesting that their emission could result from pollinator-mediated selection. In field assays, the apocarotenoid β-ionone attracted carpenter bees, but also bees from other functional groups. The benzenoid (E)-methyl cinnamate did not attract significant numbers of pollinators. Thus, β-ionone functions as a non-specific bee attractant, while apocarotenoid FVs emerge as consistent indicators of pollination by large food-foraging bees among bee-pollinated flowers. ; Output Status: Forthcoming/Available Online},

	abstract = {Trait‐mediated indirect interactions ( TMII ) can be as important as density‐mediated indirect interactions. Here, we provide evidence for a novel trait‐mediated cascade (where one TMII affects another TMII ) and demonstrate that the mechanism consists of a predator eavesdropping on chemical signaling. Ants protect scale insects from predation by adult coccinellid beetles – the first TMII . However, parasitic phorid flies reduce ant foraging activity by 50\% – the second TMII , providing a window of opportunity for female beetles to oviposit in high‐quality microsites. Beetle larvae are protected from ant predation and benefit from living in patches with high scale densities. We demonstrate that female beetles can detect pheromones released by the ant when attacked by phorids, and that only females, and especially gravid females, are attracted to the ant pheromone. As ants reduce their movement when under attack by phorids, we conclude that phorids facilitate beetle oviposition, thus producing the TMII cascade. We experimentally demonstrate a cascade of trait‐mediated indirect interactions involving two TMII units: (1) an ant–hemipteran mutualism unit, where the ants interfere with the ability of coccinellid predators to attack scale insects, and (2) a phorid fly‐ant‐hemipteran unit where the phorid flies reduce the foraging activity of the ants thus reducing their ability to interfere with the coccinellid predator. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the gravid female coccinellid beetles indeed eavesdrop on the ant pheromone to find a window of opportunity to oviposit and hide their eggs in high‐quality microsites with high densities of their prey. This level of tight connection between a beetle predator and an ant that tends a hemipteran prey is unique in the scientific literature. ; Peer Reviewed ; http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/93676/1/ece3322.pdf},

	abstract = {Increasing temperatures due to changing global climate are interfering with plant–pollinator mutualism, an interaction facilitated mainly by floral colour and scent. Gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy analyses revealed that increasing ambient temperature leads to a decrease in phenylpropanoid‐based floral scent production in two Petunia × hybrida varieties, P720 and Blue Spark, acclimated at 22/16 or 28/22 °C (day/night). This decrease could be attributed to down‐regulation of scent‐related structural gene expression from both phenylpropanoid and shikimate pathways, and up‐regulation of a negative regulator of scent production, emission of benzenoids V (EOBV). To test whether the negative effect of increased temperature on scent production can be reduced in flowers with enhanced metabolic flow in the phenylpropanoid pathway, we analysed floral volatile production by transgenic ‘Blue Spark’ plants overexpressing CaMV 35S‐driven Arabidopsis thaliana production of anthocyanin pigments 1 (PAP1) under elevated versus standard temperature conditions. Flowers of 35S:PAP1 transgenic plants produced the same or even higher levels of volatiles when exposed to a long‐term high‐temperature regime. This phenotype was also evident when analysing relevant gene expression as inferred from sequencing the transcriptome of 35S:PAP1 transgenic flowers under the two temperature regimes. Thus, up‐regulation of transcription might negate the adverse effects of temperature on scent production.We demonstrate that petunia flowers produce less volatile phenylpropanoid compounds, in both scent bouquets and internal pools, in response to elevated temperatures. We reveal that the decrease in floral scent is correlated with reduced transcript levels of scent‐related genes, and that the adverse effect of high temperature can be negated by expressing transcriptional up‐regulators. We believe that the conclusions and implications drawn from the original data presented in our manuscript will be of particular interest to a broad spectrum of your readers, particularly in view of recent changes in global climate and the risk of environmental disruption of plant–pollinator mutualism. ; Peer Reviewed ; http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/112003/1/pce12486-sup-0001-si.pdf ; http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/112003/2/pce12486.pdf},

	title = {Factors affecting the response of thrips to an olfactory cue},
	url = {https://hdl.handle.net/10182/5890},
	abstract = {Some thrips (Order Thysanoptera) are key pests of many greenhouse and outdoor crops worldwide. Biological attributes such as polyphagy, rapid reproduction, cryptic behaviour and insecticide resistance make them particularly difficult to manage. Because a large number of insects utilize plant volatiles in host finding, there is growing interest in exploiting the olfactory cues that insects use to find their hosts, including the use of semiochemicals as attractants in pest management. However, our understanding of the mechanisms eliciting the response of thrips to semiochemicals is still only rudimentary and a greater understanding of their behavioural response to olfactory cues is needed to optimize the use of semiochemicals. An ecological approach has been taken to investigate the reasons why the use of a known thrips attractant, methyl isonicotinate (MI), in combination with coloured traps works better in some situations than in others that appear very similar. The approach investigated the influence of selected intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the response of the worldwide polyphagous pest western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande)). Several studies undertaken previously using MI-based kairomone lures have shown large variations in trapping efficacy both within and between different trials. Most notable were results from southeast Spain where there appeared to be an overall lack of effect. Specific objectives include examination of the release kinetics and release rates of MI from passive dispensers, the effect of different release rates of MI on thrips response in greenhouse environments, the attraction of WFT to MI under controlled laboratory conditions, and further investigations of the lack of responsiveness of Spanish WFT to MI to determine whether there are intraspecific differences among WFT populations. Two main results can be drawn from the research in this thesis. First, the results showed that intrinsic factors such as phenotype play a much larger role than previously expected in the responses of thrips to an olfactory cue. Y-tube olfactometer assays testing MI under controlled conditions using populations collected from different countries showed that WFT differ in their response to an olfactory cue depending on which region of the world they are from. The work in this thesis confirmed previous experiments that WFT collected from southeast Spain did not respond to MI. Significantly more WFT collected from New Zealand (73\%), The Netherlands (72\%), Kenya (70\%) and France (61\%) preferred the MI laden arm in the Y-tube olfactometer over the clean arm. However, Spanish WFT populations did not show any significant preference for the MI laden arm. Additional Y-tube olfactometer studies undertaken to further explore this non-response, using different doses and concentrations, and an alternative thrips kairomone lure, showed the same result: no positive behavioural response was found for the WFT population collected in Spain. This suggests the development of a different behavioural phenotype of WFT in Spain has occurred. Additional experiments using electroantennogram (EAG) technique showed that Spanish WFT can detect MI at least at the peripheral olfactory reception level, and suggest that the non-response is due to failure in the olfactory signal pathway of the central nervous system. While the work undertaken in this study suggests that underlying genetic variation between populations is the basis of the difference, the reason for this non-response is still to be determined. Second, the study identified that several extrinsic factors influence the level of response in populations of WFT that showed a significant response to MI. While the dispensers were used for releasing MI at a constant rate (zero-order kinetics), temperature was shown to influence the release rate strongly. Increasing the temperature from 15 to 25°C, resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in the release rate of MI for a commercially available sachet. Airflow was also shown to affect the release rate. Considering the critical role release rates of kairomones play in insect trap responses, it is reasonable to infer that differences in release rates as a result of choice of passive dispenser and extrinsic factors, such as temperature and air flow, could account for some of the variation previously experienced in field and greenhouse trials using MI to trap thrips. This was confirmed in a greenhouse study showing the response thrips to MI was at least partially positively dose related. The greenhouse trial also highlighted other areas believed to play a role on the responsiveness of thrips such as odour saturation of the air surrounding traps used in the greenhouse. The fundamental information on the intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the behavioural response of thrips to odours obtained from this research can be used to design better tools for monitoring and trapping thrips pests using semiochemicals in New Zealand and worldwide.},

	abstract = {Lorsque l'environnement est variable, les comportements plastiques sont adaptés, à condition d'être basés sur des informations fiables. Dans le cas de la dispersion, les informations importantes concernent la comparaison entre la fitness qu'il est possible de gagner dans un site et celle qu'il est possible de gagner ailleurs dans l'habitat. Dans cette thèse, les décisions de dispersion d'un parasitoïde de pucerons sont étudiées expérimentalement, dans le cadre théorique de l'optimisation et de la théorie des jeux. Les résultats d'expériences au laboratoire montrent que les parasitoïdes perçoivent et mémorisent des signaux volatiles émis par les plantes en réponse à la présence de pucerons pour estimer la profitabilité des colonies de pucerons, et adapter leur temps de résidence dans les colonies. D'une part, les parasitoïdes restent plus longtemps dans une colonie lorsque les signaux des plantes indiquent que la colonie contient de nombreux pucerons. D'autre part, les parasitoïdes augmentent leur temps de résidence si les plantes précédemment visitées indiquent que le reste de l'habitat contient relativement peu d'hôtes. La manière dont les parasitoïdes mettent à jour leur estimation de l'habitat en fonction de leur expérience n'est pas très clairement résolue. La dispersion des parasitoïdes est aussi étudiée en population naturelle, en testant les prédictions de la distribution libre idéale. Le génotype microsatellite des individus émergeant de pucerons parasités permet de déterminer le nombre de femelles de la génération précédente ayant pondu dans une colonie et le nombre de descendants produits par femelle dans chaque colonie. Les résultats montrent que les femelles ne sont pas distribuées de manière libre idéale. Leur forte propension à disperser semble plutôt être sélectionnée par des pressions venant des niveaux trophiques supérieurs, comme les prédateurs et les hyperparasitoïdes. L'ensemble des résultats obtenus dans cette thèse indique que les décisions de dispersion des parasitoïdes sont plastiques et se basent sur des informations provenant des différents niveaux trophiques présents dans les communautés. L'effet relatif de chaque information sur les décisions des parasitoïdes reste une question ouverte, qui mériterait une approche d'écologie des communautés. ; In a variable environment, plastic decisions are adaptive at the condition to be based on reliable information. For dispersal, significant information concerns the comparison between the fitness gain expected in a given site and the one expected elsewhere in the environment. In this thesis, dispersal decisions of an aphid parasitoid are studied experimentally, within the framework of optimisation and evolutionarily game theory. Results of laboratory experiments show that parasitoids perceive and memorise aphid-induced plant volatiles to assess the profitability of aphid colonies and adapt their residence time on the colonies. On the one hand, parasitoids stay longer on a given colony when plant signals indicate that the colony contains many aphids. On the other hand, parasitoids increase their residence time on a colony when previously visited plants indicate that the habitat contains few hosts. How parasitoids update their estimate of habitat profitability according to experience is still unclear. Parasitoid dispersal is also studied in natural population, by testing predictions of the ideal free distribution. The microsatellite genotype of individuals emerging from parasitised aphids allows to estimate the number of females that reproduced in an aphid colony at the previous generation, and the number of offspring per female in each colony. Results show that female are not distributed according to the ideal free distribution. Instead, their high dispersal propensity may be selected for by pressure coming from upper trophic levels such as predators and hyperparasitoids. Altogether, the results presented here indicate that dispersal decisions of parasitoids are plastic and based on information from different trophic levels of the community. The relative effect of each information on parasitoid decisions is still an open question, which could be answered by an approach of community ecology. ; NICE-BU Sciences (060882101) / Sudoc ; Sudoc ; France ; FR},

	abstract = {En réponse à des dommages causés par les insectes phytophages, les plantes produisent des composés volatiles signalant aux ennemis naturels de l’herbivore la présence d’hôtes ou de proies. D’importants progrès ont été réalisés dans la compréhension de telles interactions trophiques se déroulant aux alentours de la partie aérienne de la plante. De nos jours, l’influence des communautés souterraines, par l’intermédiaire de changements physiologiques et biochimiques de la plante, sur les communautés aériennes est de plus en plus reconnue. Le contenu de cette thèse vise à apporter de nouveaux points de vue sur ces interactions. Le modèle étudié était composé de plantes de maïs (Zea mais L.) dont les feuilles étaient soumises aux attaques du ver du cotonnier (Spodoptera littoralis Boisduval) et les racines aux attaques de la chrysomèle du maïs (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte). Le développement d’un olfactomètre souterrain à 6 bras nous a permis de mener une étude sur les interactions tritrophiques se déroulant dans le sol. Grâce à l’utilisation de ce dispositif, nous avons découvert que les racines d’une plante attaquée par Diabrotica émettent une substance attirant les nématodes entomopathogènes Heterorhabditis megidis Poinar, Jakson \& Klein. Cette attirance est principalement le résultat de l’émission dans le sol, par les racines dévorées, d’un sesquiterpène, le (E)--caryophyllene. L’importance de ce dernier lors du phénomène d’attirance des nématodes fût également confirmée au travers d’expériences en champ lors desquelles nous avons comparé des variétés de maïs productrices de (E)--caryophyllene avec des variétés ayant perdu cette faculté (Chapitre I). Afin d’analyser l’effet croisé entre les interactions aériennes et souterraines et le rôle de la plante en tant que vecteur dudit effet, nous avons connectés l’olfactomètre souterrain à un olfactomètre aérien. Grâce ce nouvel assemblage, nous avons étudié simultanément l’attirance de guêpes parasites et de nématodes en fonction des odeurs émises par les plantes de maïs attaquées par des herbivores soit dans leur partie aérienne, soit souterraine ou encore lors d’une attaque simultanée des deux parties. Il a été démontré que les ravages du système racinaire influencent les interactions tritrophiques aériennes de même que les ravages du système foliaire ont pour résultat la modification des interactions tritrophiques souterraines (Chapitre II). La spécificité de cette nouvelle interaction trophique souterraine fût testée en utilisant différentes espèces de plantes, d’insectes herbivores et de nématodes (Chapitre III). En parallèle à l’intérêt fondamental concernant l’écologie et les mécanismes régulant ces interactions multitrophiques, cette recherche fût également conduite dans l’optique d’améliorer les possibilités de lutte biologique contre les deux importants ravageurs étudiés. D’un point de vue plus général, cette thèse contribue à la compréhension du rôle joué par l’émission de volatiles induits lors d’interactions tritrophiques, qu’elle soit souterraine ou aérienne. Elle met également en lumière l’influence réciproque des interactions se déroulant dans ces deux milieux. De plus, cette thèse démontre pour la première fois, à notre connaissance, que les stratégies de défense indirecte des plantes peuvent améliorer, dans des conditions réelles, l’efficacité d’agents utilisés pour la lutte biologique ; In response to phytophagous insects attack, plants produce volatile compounds that can serve as cues for natural enemies of the herbivore to locate their host or prey. Very substantial progress has been made in understanding such tritrophic interactions aboveground. Recently, however, it is more and more recognized that aboveground communities are influenced through physiological and biochemical changes in plants driven by belowground communities and the current thesis aimed to provide new insight in these interactions. Corn (Zea mais L.) plants attacked by the leaf feeder noctuid butterfly (Spodoptera littoralis Boisduval) and the root feeder larvae of the western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) were used as a model system. We investigated belowground tritrophic interactions by developing a belowground six arm olfactometer. With the use of this device we discovered that Diabrotica-attacked plants emit an attractant for the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis megidis Poinar, Jackson \& Klein. The attraction was mainly caused by the release of the sesquiterpene (E)--caryophyllene in the soil after root feeding. The importance of the compound in the attraction for the nematodes was further confirmed in field experiments using (E)--caryophyllene producing and non-producing corn varieties (Chapter I). To investigate cross effects between plant-mediated below- and aboveground interactions we connected an above- and a belowground olfactometer, and used this assembly to simultaneously study attraction of parasitic wasps and nematode to the odour emissions of maize after herbivory by either the above or the below ground herbivore, or by both. It was found that indeed root feeding influences aboveground tritrophic interactions, and vice-versa leaf feeding influences belowground tritrophic interactions (Chapter II). The specificity of the newly discovered belowground interaction was tested by using different plant, herbivore and nematode species (Chapter III). Besides a fundamental interest in the ecology and mechanisms involved multitrophic interactions, the work was also driven by an interest to find ways of enhancing a possible biological control of the two major maize pests that were under study. Overall the thesis contributed to our understanding of the role of induced plant volatiles in above- and belowground tritrophic interactions and of how these two interactions may influence one another. Moreover, the thesis is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate in the field that indirect plant defences can indeed be used to enhance the efficacy of a biological control agent},

	abstract = {SUMMARY Plants as primary producers in terrestrial ecosystems are under constant threat from a multitude of attackers, which include insect herbivores. In addition to interactions with detrimental organisms, plants host a diversity of beneficial organisms, which include microbes in the rhizosphere. Furthermore, the interactions between plants and several groups of root-associated microbes such as mycorrhizae, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and plant growth promoting fungi (PGPF) can affect plant interactions with foliar insect herbivores. The beneficial root-associated microbes are able to modify plant physiology by promoting plant growth and induced systemic resistance (ISR), in which the balance between both effects will determine the final impact on the insect herbivores. Using Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0, this thesis explores the molecular mechanisms on how plants integrate responses when simultaneously interacting with the rhizobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and the generalist and the specialist leaf-chewing insects Mamestra brassicae and Pieris brassicae respectively. A literature review on the state-of-the-art in the field of microbe-plant-insect interactions (Chapter 2) explores how root-associated microbes and insect folivores can influence each other via a shared host plant. For more than a decade, both ecological and mechanistic studies mostly focused on exploring these belowground and aboveground interactions using single microbe and single herbivore species. The importance of increasing the complexity of the study system in order to understand the interactions in more natural situations is being emphasized. Furthermore, this review discusses the role of plant hormones in regulating plant growth and defense against folivores, while simultaneously being involved in associations with root-associated microbes. Experimental evidence has shown patterns on the effects of mycorrhizal colonization on plant interactions with insect herbivores, and raises the question whether plant colonization by different groups of root-associated microbes has similar effects on particular categories of insect herbivores. In Chapter 3, plant-mediated effects of a non-pathogenic rhizobacterium on the performance of leaf-chewing insects, and the underlying mechanisms modulating the interactions, have been examined. Colonization of A. thaliana Col-0 roots by the bacterium P. fluorescens strain WCS417r resulted in decreased larval weight of the generalist leaf-chewing M. brassicae , and had no effect on larval weight of the specialist leaf-chewing P. brassicae . The crucial role of jasmonic acid (JA) in regulating rhizobacteria-mediated induced systemic resistance (ISR) against M. brassicae is confirmed by including plant mutants in the study. Interestingly, I also observed that rhizobacteria can induce systemic susceptibility to M. brassicae caterpillars. Comparison of M. brassicae performance and gene transcription in A. thaliana plants, grown in potting soil or a mixture of potting soil and sand in a 1:1 ratio, shows that in a mixture of potting soil and sand, rhizobacterial treatment had a consistently negative effect on M. brassicae , whereas the effect is more variable in potting soil. Rhizobacterial treatment primed plants grown in potting soil and sand for stronger expression of JA- and ethylene-regulated genes PDF1.2 and HEL, supporting stronger resistance to M. brassicae . Taken together, the results show that soil composition can be one of the factors modulating the outcome of microbe-plant-insect interactions. Chapter 4 further addresses the mechanisms underlying rhizobacteria-mediated ISR against the generalist leaf-chewing M. brassicae by integrating plant gene transcription, chemistry and performance of M. brassicae in wild type A. thaliana Col-0 plants and mutants defective in the JA-pathway, i.e. dde2-2 and myc2 , in the ET pathway, i.e. ein2-1 , and in the JA-/ET-pathway, i.e. ora59 . Results of this study show that rhizobacterial colonization alone or in combination with herbivore infestation induced the expression of the defense-associated genes ORA59 and PDF1.2 at higher levels than activation by herbivore feeding alone, and the expression of both genes is suppressed in the knock-out mutant ora59 . Interestingly, the colonization of plant roots by rhizobacteria alters the levels of plant defense compounds, i.e. camalexin and glucosinolates (GLS), by enhancing the synthesis of constitutive and induced levels of camalexin and aliphatic GLS while suppressing the induced levels of indole GLS. The changes are associated with modulation of the JA-/ET-signaling pathways as shown by investigating mutants. Furthermore, the herbivore performance results show that functional JA- and ET-signaling pathways are required for rhizobacteria-mediated ISR against leaf-chewing insects as observed in the knock-out mutants dde2-2 and ein2-1 . The results indicate that colonization of plant roots by rhizobacteria modulates plant-insect interactions by prioritizing the ORA59-branch over the MYC2-branch, although the transcription factor ORA59 is not the only one responsible for the observed effects of rhizobacteria-mediated ISR against leaf-chewing insects. Taking a step further in increasing the complexity of the study system, Chapter 5 investigates how co-cultivation of P. fluorescens strains WCS417r and SS101 affects direct plant defense to the caterpillar M. brassicae . Inoculation of either P. fluorescens WCS417r or SS101 singly at root tips or simultaneously at two different positions along the roots resulted in a similar level of rhizobacterial colonization by each strain, whereas co-cultivation of both strains at either the root tips or at two different positions along the roots resulted in a higher colonization level of strain WCS417r compared to colonization by SS101. The results suggest that the site of inoculation influences the direct interactions between the two strains in the rhizosphere, as also confirmed by in vitro antagonism assays in the absence of plants. Both upon single inoculation and co-cultivation of both strains at the same or different sites along the roots, the two rhizobacterial strains induced the same strength of ISR against the caterpillar M. brassicae and the same degree of plant growth promotion. In the roots, colonization by the two strains as single or mixed culture resulted in a similar gene expression pattern of up-regulation of MYC2 , down-regulation of WRKY70 and no effect on NPR1 expression, genes representing JA-signaling, SA-signaling and the node of crosstalk between the two pathways, respectively. We hypothesize that both rhizobacterial strains use negative crosstalk between JA- and SA-pathways as mechanism to suppress plant immunity and establish colonization. This study shows that competitive interactions between rhizobacterial strains known to induce plant defense in systemic tissue via different signaling pathways, may interfere with synergistic effects on ISR and plant growth promotion. While the effect of root-associated microbes on direct plant defense against insect herbivores has been studied previously, the effect of these microbes on indirect plant defense to herbivores is much less known. Chapter 6 explores how colonization by the rhizobacterium P. fluorescens strain WCS417r affects indirect plant defense against the generalist herbivore M. brassicae by combining behavioral, chemical and gene transcriptional approaches. The results show that rhizobacterial colonization of A. thaliana roots results in an increased attraction of the parasitoid Microplitis mediator to caterpillar-infested plants. Volatile analysis revealed that rhizobacterial colonization suppressed emission of the terpene ( E )-α-bergamotene, and the aromatics methyl salicylate and lilial in response to caterpillar feeding. Rhizobacterial colonization decreased the caterpillar-induced transcription of the terpene synthase genes TPS03 and TPS04 . Rhizobacteria enhanced both growth and indirect defense of plants under caterpillar attack. This study shows that rhizobacteria have a high potential to enhance the biocontrol of leaf-chewing herbivores based on enhanced attraction of parasitoids. Taken together, the research presented in this thesis has shown how single or combined applications of rhizobacteria affect interactions of plants with leaf-chewing insects in terms of direct and indirect resistance. Furthermore, results presented in this thesis have revealed some of the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-mediated interactions between rhizobacteria and leaf-chewing insects that can be used in developing practical approaches by applying beneficial root-associated microbes for improving plant resistance.},

	abstract = {真核生物中蛋白的功能會被一些小的polypeptide，像是ubiquitin（Ub）或是ubiquitin-like（Ubl）proteins等利用共價鍵結的方式所調控，這種調控方式稱做post-translation modification。這些小蛋白會以C端（Gly-Gly motif）並利用isopeptide bond的方式和其目標蛋白上的Lys進行鍵結，而本研究的主角則為此類蛋白中的其中一種，稱做SUMO（small ubiquitin-like modifiers）。此蛋白是我們以二維電泳系統分析經過NO處理的甘藷葉片（Ipomoea batatas cv. Tainong 57）所誘導出來蛋白的其中一個，將這蛋白分離回收後經過比對發現和阿拉伯芥的SUMO2具有較高的性似性，因此我們從其他物種已知序列中設計出Degenerate引子，分別以Inverse PCR (iPCR) 和RACE (Rapid amplification of cDNA ends) 兩種方法找到基因的3’端和5’端，並命名為IbSUMO2。首先從RNA的層次以北方墨點法分析IbSUMO2基因的表現量，發現在分別處理NO（Nitric oxide）、機械性傷害和H2O2的時候，IbSUMO2基因的表現量都會增加；另外在處理NO和H2O2的抑制劑之後再進行機械性傷害，則發現IbSUMO2的基因表現量有減少的現象發生，可以推測在機械性傷害之後IbSUMO2 mRNA的產生是經由NO和H2O2兩條路徑。從內生的IbSUMO2蛋白層次來看，在處理 NO後以西方墨點法對甘藷內生的IbSUMO2蛋白質含量進行分析，結果發現在第四天的時候IbSUMO2蛋白量會增加。另外在IbSUMO2蛋白功能探討方面，在進行傷害十分鐘後，即可發現甘藷內生SUMO的結合態明顯增加，這可以推測SUMO所負責的蛋白修飾作用在植物受到傷害的時候是很早期的一個防禦反應。從免疫沈澱反應中，以傷害24小時的甘藷葉片蛋白和SUMO1的抗體進行沈澱，在45 KDa的地方可以發現兩個明顯的條帶，推測此兩個條帶即為有和IbSUMO結合的蛋白。再來我們也利用洋蔥短暫表現系統來偵測帶有GFP的IbSUMO2在NO刺激下是否有位移的現象出現，不過利用此系統無法發現在NO的處理下，帶有GFP的IbSUMO2有任何的改變發生。從以上結果發現我們可以知道在不同刺激之下，IbSUMO2的確具有其特定的生理功能。 ; Small ubiquitin-like modifer (SUMO) is a member of the superfamily of ubiquitin-like polypeptides that play a role in post-translational modification, but its functions are different from those of ubiquitin. SUMOs attach target proteins by covalent bond, and alter their function and location. The regulation of SUMO2 expression in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) was studied here. We had isolated a nitric oxide (NO)-induced IbSUMO2 protein from two-dimensional electrophoresis system, and also observed a significant increasing of IbSUMO2 mRNA under the treatment of NO or H2O2 induced by mechanical wounding. The increasing of IbSUMO2 protein under NO treatment was also observed by western blotting analysis. On the contrary, the application of NO or H2O2 inhibitors can reduce the expression of IbSUMO2 mRNA induced by mechanical wounding, suggesting IbSUMO2 protein induced by mechanical wounding through NO and H2O2 signal pathway. We also detected the level of IbSUMO2 conjugation under mechanical wounding and NO treatment. The wound-induced conjugate accumulation could be detected within 10 minutes, suggesting that IbSUMO2 conjugation is one of the early events for plant to response to mechanical wounding. On the other hand, immunoprecipitation of IbSUMO2 conjugated proteins were performed with SUMO antibodies, and two major bands around 45 KDa were observed. Furthermore, in transient expression system, we confirm the localization of IbSUMO2 protein within cell under NO stimulations. Conclusively, IbSUMO2 protein conjugated to its target proteins has multiple physiological functions in plant cells. ; 中文摘要 英文摘要 第一章 前言 一、植物的防禦機制•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 1 二、SUMO的作用與機制••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 6 三、實驗方向與目的•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 9 第二章 材料與方法 一、材料••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 10 二、甘藷葉片處理••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 10 三、質體的構築與製備•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 12 四、甘藷葉片DNA的萃取•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 13 五、甘藷葉片RNA的萃取•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 14 六、甘藷葉片蛋白的萃取••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 16 七、蛋白質SDS膠體電泳分析•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 17 八、Inverse PCR (iPCR) •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 20 九、Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) ••••••••••••••••••••• 22 十、北方墨點分析••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 23 十一、西方墨點分析•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 25 十二、BL21(DE3)系列大腸桿菌蛋白之誘導測試與萃取純化••••••••••••• 27 十三、基因槍法（particle bombardment）••••••••••••••••••••••••• 29 十四、蛋白質共同免疫沈澱••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 31 第三章 結果 一、甘藷SUMO2基因之調取及比對•••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 34 二、甘藷SUMO2基因訊息傳遞過程•••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 36 三、外加NO處理之下甘藷SUMO蛋白的表現••••••••••••••••••••• 40 四、甘藷SUMO蛋白與其目標蛋白結合情形•••••••••••••••••••••• 40 五、甘藷SUMO2在細胞中的表現位置•••••••••••••••••••••••••• 41 六、利用共同免疫沈澱法找出與SUMO2結合之蛋白••••••••••••••••• 42 七、大腸菌（BL21 (DE3)）表現甘藷SUMO2蛋白••••••••••••••••••• 43 第四章 討論 一、甘藷SUMO2蛋白序列的分析••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 44 二、甘藷SUMO2基因的訊息傳遞過程•••••••••••••••••••••••••• 45 三、甘藷SUMO2蛋白的功能探討••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 51 四、結論••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 56 第五章 參考文獻•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 58 圖表••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 65},

	abstract = {Plant volatiles mediate host discrimination and host finding in phytophagous insects. Understanding how insects recognize these signals is a current challenge in chemical ecology research. Pear ester, ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate, is a powerful, bisexual attractant of codling moth Cydia pomonella (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) and strongly synergizes the male response to female-produced sex pheromone. We show here that the codling moth odorant receptor (OR) CpomOR3 is dedicated to detecting this plant volatile. Heterologous expression of CpomOR3 in Drosophila T1 trichoid and ab3A basiconic sensilla, followed by a screening with codling moth pheromone compounds and known plant volatile attractants, confirms that CpomOR3 binds to pear ester. Although CpomOR3 does not respond to any of the pheromone components tested, a phylogenetic analysis of lepidopteran chemosensory receptor genes reveals a close relationship of CpomOR3 with pheromone receptors (PRs) in moths. This corroborates the interaction of ecological and social chemosensory cues during premating communication. The finding that a plant volatile compound, pear ester, is a specific ligand for a PR-like lepidopteran receptor adds to our understanding of insect-plant interactions and emphasizes the interaction of natural and sexual selection during the phylogenetic divergence of insect herbivores.},

	abstract = {Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) synergize with the sex pheromones of herbivorous insects to facilitate mate location. However, the synergism of HIPVs and acoustic signals for sexual communication remains unknown. Here, we investigated the synergy between HIPVs and vibrational duets for sexual communication and mating in the pea leafminer ( Liriomyza huidobrensis ). Our results indicated that adult leafminers do not produce species-specific pheromone, and female-puncture-induced plant volatiles facilitate the attraction of both sexes to host plant leaves and sexual encounters. Insect-derived cues do not participate in mate locations. Both sexes do not produce qualitatively different cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), and CHCs from females cannot elicit the antennal and behavioural responses of males. By contrast, induced green leaf volatiles, terpenoids and oximes elicit dramatic antennal responses in both sexes. Electrophysiological and behavioural tests consistently showed that the volatiles (Z)-3-hexenol and (Z)-3-hexenyl-acetate elicited the most intense gas chromatographic-electroantennographic responses, and attracted males and females. Remarkably, these volatiles significantly promoted the occurrence of vibrational duets between the sexes, thereby increasing the mating success of leafminers. Therefore, the synergism of HIPVs and vibrational signals largely promoted the mating success of leafminers, suggesting an alternative control strategy through precision trapping for non-pheromone-producing insects.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Biotic signalling sheds light on smart pest management’.},

	abstract = {Ant nests and their surrounding territories represent a hoard of trophic resources, as well as of stable and protected environments for many arthropods involved in commensal, mutualistic, or parasitic associations. Among these organisms, called myrmecophiles, several are butterflies. Here, we explore the amazing diversity of strategies developed by myrmecophilous butterflies to “cheat” or manipulate ants and to elude the tough defenses of the colony. During oviposition, female butterflies use visual or plant volatile signals to identify the presence of ants, whereas chemical and vibroacoustic cues, either isolated or combined, are used by larvae and pupae to attract, deceive, or appease workers. Examples of mimicry and eavesdropping on both intraspecific and interspecific signals are discussed, primarily referring to the obligate-parasitic interactions involving Maculinea butterflies and Myrmica ants. Multimodal communication is crucial to maintaining the strong cohesion and social structure of ant societies, but its corruption is at the base of the evolution and persistence of interspecific associations, which can be beneficial or detrimental for the colony's fitness. In this framework, the remarkable complexity of signaling could have prompted the evolution of specialized life cycles enhancing the extraordinary butterfly diversity.},

	url = {http://aphidophaga.de/index.php?id=3},
	abstract = {Semiochemicals provide a powerful way for organisms to communicate and coordinate their behaviors. But they also represent opportunities for other organisms to intercept and exploit such signals. There are now numerous examples of natural enemies eavesdropping the intraspecific communication of their prey to better locate them. Aphid natural enemies, including predators and parasitoids, frequently exhibit innate responses to chemical cues reliably associated with aphids, and there is also abundant evidence that learning of profitable chemical cues frequently occurs. Thenceforth, the efficiency of aphid natural enemies to locate their prey is mainly based on their ability to perceive and orientate toward aphid-associated semiochemicals. Aphid predators were shown to respond to different groups of aphid-related semiochemicals, including aphid-induced plant volatiles; aphid pheromones and the more recently identified bacteria-produced honeydew volatiles. These laboratory studies suggest potentially promising avenues for the deployment of aphid-associated semiochemicals for the management of these pest species. While laboratory experiments are invaluable tools for revealing mechanisms, additional field studies are however needed to test ecological relevance of the observed effects. Although it is now possible to attract naturally occurring aphid predators in a crop field using semiochemicals, future work should more fully explore the broader ecological context in which signaling occurs. The information gained from a deeper understanding of the chemical ecology of aphid-natural enemy interaction will enhance our understanding of the chemical biology and ecology of aphids, and may facilitate the design of novel control strategies.},

However, the effects are variable depending on the cropping system, and emissions may increase, decrease, or be not affected by nutrient availability. Here, we evaluated the effects of different fertilizer regimes, which varied nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) availability, on HIPV emissions in cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait. Plants included six cranberry varieties that were subjected to four different fertilizer regimes and either noninduced or induced with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), an elicitor of HIPVs, in a 6 × 4 × 2 factorial design. Results show that enhanced NPK fertilizer applications increased total HIPV emissions in MeJA-treated cranberries, regardless of variety. This effect was due to an increase in plant fresh weight. Although the ecological effects of increased HIPV emissions need to be investigated, these findings may have implications for natural enemy manipulation in agro-ecosystems.},

	abstract = {This data set contain raw data associated with the manuscript titled "Silencing the alarm: An insect salivary enzyme closes plant stomata and inhibits volatile release". Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are widely recognized as ecologically important to plant. While the majority of studies focused on the induction of this “cry for help”, little is known about whether insect herbivores have evolved mechanisms to reduce the release of HIPVs. Here we show that a caterpillar (Helicoverpa zea) salivary enzyme, glucose oxidase (GOX), commonly secreted on plant leaves causes stomatal closure and reductions in emissions of several HIPVs involved in plant defenses. We found that application of GOX to wounded regions of leaves led to reductions in stomatal conductance on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and soybean (Glycine max) for at least two days. The role of GOX in reducing stomatal aperture was confirmed using GOX knockout lines of H. zea (CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis), and microscopic observations of stomata. In addition, GOX reduced the emission of several HIPVs during feeding by H. zea, including (Z)-3-hexenol, (Z)-jasmone, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, which are important air borne signals in plant defenses. Our findings highlight a novel mechanism where insect herbivore reduces the release of HIPVs during feeding by targeting fundamental plant structure (i.e. stomata), and the link between of stomatal dynamics and releases of HIPVs. We demonstrate the existence of HIPVs-interfering mechanisms as a potential evolutionary strategy for insect herbivores to interfere with plant air borne signals. : For detailed methodology please refer to the paper. : Data are in ".csv" files.

	abstract = {Agarwood is the resinous infected wood obtained from Aquilaria species, which is a highly priced product in the flavour and fragrance market. Its formation is a complex process of interaction between the plant, insect, and microorganisms. Multiple studies concerning the interaction of microorganisms with the Aquilaria tree have been reported. However, the significant interaction between the insect Zeuzera conferta Walker (Lepidoptera: Cossidae) with Aquilaria has been overlooked, and only exiguous studies have been accomplished. Considering the dearth of available literature on this interesting phenomenon a review has been attempted. The taxonomical and morphological descriptions proffered by researchers and the insect life cycle are discussed. The review lays emphasis on the chemical ecology of the interaction between Z. conferta, Aquilaria and associating microorganisms as a possible continuum operating in the form of complex chemical signalling via release and sensing of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), Herbivore Induced Plant Volatiles (HIPVs) and Microbial Volatile Organic Compounds (MVOCs). The review also scrutinizes the future perspectives of understanding the interaction in devising suitable management strategies to prevent uncontrolled infestation and, simultaneously, develop artificial rearing technology for the insect Z. conferta as a strategy for ensuring sustainable livelihood of farmers dependent on agarwood production. ; Grassroots Journal of Natural Resources},

	abstract = {Indirect responses are defensive strategies by which plants attract natural enemies of their herbivores that act as plant defending agents. Such defences can be either constitutively expressed or induced by the combined action of mechanical damage and low- or high-molecularweight elicitors from the attacking herbivore. Here, we focus on two induced indirect defences, namely the de novo production of volatiles and the secretion of extrafloral nectar, which both mediate interactions with organisms from higher trophic levels (i.e., parasitoids or carnivores). We give an overview on elicitors, early signals, and signal transduction resulting in a complex regulation of indirect defences and discuss effects of cross-talks between the signalling pathways (synergistic and antagonistic effects). In the light of recent findings, we review molecular and genetic aspects of the biosynthesis of herbivore-induced plant volatiles comprising terpenoids, aromatic compounds, and metabolites of fatty acids which act as infochemicals for animals and some of which even induce defence genes in neighbouring plants. Finally, ecological aspects of these two indirect defences such as their variability, specificity, evolution as well as their ecological relevance in nature are discussed.},

Identification of stimuli that trigger upwind flight attraction towards host plants is a current challenge, and is essential in developing new, sustainable plant protection methods, and for furthering our understanding of plant-insect interactions. Using behavioral, analytical and electrophysiological studies, we here show that both females and males of the Egyptian cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), use blends of volatile compounds to locate their host plant, cotton, Gossypium hirsutum (Malvales, Malvaceae). Female S. littoralis were engaged in upwind orientation flight in a wind tunnel when headspace collected from cotton plants was delivered through a piezoelectric sprayer. Although males took off towards cotton headspace significantly fewer males than females flew upwind towards the sprayed headspace. Subsequent assays with antennally active synthetic compounds revealed that a blend of nonanal, (Z)-3 hexenyl acetate, (E)-β-ocimene, and (R)-(+)-limonene was as attractive as cotton headspace to females and more attractive to males. DMNT and (R)-(-)-linalool, both known plant defense compounds may have reduced the flight attraction of both females and males; more moths were attracted to blends without these two compounds. Our findings provide a platform for further investigations on host plant signals mediating innate behavior, and for the development of novel insect plant protection strategies against S. littoralis.},

	abstract = {Silicon (Si) is important in plant defenses that operate in a direct manner against herbivores, and work in rice (Oryza sativa) has established that this is mediated by the jasmonate signaling pathway. Plant defenses also operate indirectly, by the production of herbivore induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that attract predators and parasitoids of herbivores. These indirect defenses too are mediated by the jasmonate pathway but no earlier work has demonstrated an effect of Si on HIPVs. In this study, we tested the effect of Si supplementation versus Si deprivation to rice plants on subsequent HIPV production following feeding by the important pest, rice leaffolder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis). Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analyses showed lower production of α-bergamotene, β-sesquiohellandrene, hexanal 2-ethyl, and cedrol from +Si herbivore-infested plants compared with -Si infested plants. These changes in plant chemistry were ecologically significant in altering the extent to which parasitoids were attracted to infested plants. Adult females of Trathala flavo-orbitalis and Microplitis mediator both exhibited greater attraction to the HIPV blend of +Si plants infested with their respective insect hosts compared to -Si infested plants. In equivalent studies using RNAi rice plants in which jasmonate perception was silenced there was no equivalent change to the HIPV blend associated with Si treatment; indicating that the effects of Si on HIPVs are modulated by the jasmonate pathway. Further, this work demonstrates that silicon alters the HIPV blend of herbivore-infested rice plants. The significance of this finding is that there are no earlier-published studies of this phenomenon in rice or any other plant species. Si treatment to crops offers scope for enhancing induced, indirect defenses and associated biological control of pests because parasitoids are more strongly attracted by the HIPVs produced by +Si plants.},

This study investigates the impact of plant and fungal derived volatiles on the behaviour of E. saccharina in sugarcane. The push plants chosen for this study were the grasses Melinis minutiflora and Brachiaria humidicola. Plant entrainment studies and analyses of compounds released have shown that the volatiles 4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), hexenyl acetate,-caryophyllene, methyl salicylate and 4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11 tridecatetraene (TMTT) are common to both grasses. These volatiles are well recognised plant stress signals, which are usually released by a plant as a consequence of insect herbivory. However, M. minutiflora and B. humidicola are emitting volatiles without incurring any insect damage. In addition to plant volatiles, it appears that endophytic fungal volatiles are also effective repellents and attractants of E. saccharina. In previous behavioural experiments, first instar larvae have found Fusarium sacchari to be repulsive and Fusarium pseudonygamai attractive. Both Fusarium species emit the volatiles 4-heptanone; 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene; 2-pentyl furan; t-butyl isobutyl ketone; 4-ethyl-3-methyl phenol; 6-methyl-3,5-heptadiene-2-one; 4-ethyl-1,2dimethoxy benzene; spiro[4.5]dec-7-ene; 1H-3a,7-methanoazulene.

Mosquitoes primarily rely on olfaction to locate plants and are known to respond to a range of plant volatiles. We studied the olfactory response of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and cis -jasmone (CiJA), volatile compounds originating from the octadecanoid signaling pathway that plays a key role in plant defense against herbivores. Specifically, we investigated how Ae. aegypti of different ages responded to elevated levels of CiJA in two attractive odor contexts, either derived from Lima bean plants or human skin. Aedes aegypti females landed significantly less often on a surface with CiJA and MeJA compared to the solvent control, CiJA exerting a stronger reduction in landing than MeJA. Odor context (plant or human) had no significant main effect on the olfactory responses of Ae. aegypti females to CiJA. Mosquito age significantly affected the olfactory response, older females (7–9 d) responding more strongly to elevated levels of CiJA than young females (1–3 d) in either odor context. Our results show that avoidance of CiJA by Ae. aegypti is independent of odor background, suggesting that jasmonates are inherently aversive cues to these mosquitoes. We propose that avoidance of plants with elevated levels of jasmonates is adaptive to mosquitoes to reduce the risk of encountering predators that is higher on these plants, i.e. by avoiding ‘enemy-dense-space’.},

Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) constitute a widespread group of defensive plant volatiles that convey a herbivory-specific message via their isomeric composition: feeding of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta converts (Z)-3- to (E)-2-GLVs thereby attracting predatory insects. Here we show that this isomer-coded message is monitored by ovipositing M. sexta females. We detected the isomeric shift in the host plant Datura wrightii and performed functional imaging in the primary olfactory center of M. sexta females with GLV structural isomers.

	abstract = {Floral scents play a key role in mediating plant-pollinator interactions. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by flowers are used by flower visitors as olfactory cues to locate flowers, both from a distance and at close range. More recently it has been demonstrated that reactive molecules such as ozone can modify or degrade VOCs, and this may impair the communication between plants and their pollinators. However, it is not known whether such reactive molecules also may affect the olfactory system of pollinators, and thus not only influence signal transmission but perception of the signal. In this study, we used electroantennographic measurements to determine the effect of increased levels of ozone on antennal responses in western honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Linalool and 2-phenylethanol, both known to be involved in location of flowers by the bees, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, a widespread green leaf volatile also detected by bees, were used. The results showed that ozone affected antennal responses to the different substances differently. Ozone decreased antennal responses to (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, whereas responses to linalool and 2-phenylethanol were not influenced by ozone. Overall, the study does not provide evidence that pollination by honey bees is impaired by damage in the olfactory system of the bees caused by increased levels of ozone, at least when linalool and 2-phenylethanol are the attractive signals. However, the results also suggest that ozone can change the overall perception of an odor blend. This might have negative effects in pollination systems and other organismic interactions mediated by specific ratios of compounds. ; (VLID)1650068},

	abstract = {Für die kommenden Jahre wird ein dramatischer Anstieg des weltweiten Energieverbrauches erwartet. Aufgrund des wachsenden Bedarfs an erneuerbarer Energie richtet sich das Interesse der aktuellen Forschung auf Kurzumtriebsplantagen mit schnell wachsenden und ertragreichen Salix (Weiden) und Populus (Pappeln) Arten als mögliche Energiequelle. In diesem Zusammenhang erlangt die Europäische Zitterpappel (Populus tremula) an Bedeutung, da sie im Stande ist höhere Erträge auf nährstoffarmen Böden und unter ungünstigen klimatischen Bedingungen zu erbringen. Die Europäische Zitterpappel ist eine Pionier-Art und eine der am weitesten verbreiteten Baumart in borealen und gemäßigten Wäldern. In natürlichen Vorkommen bilden Zitterpappeln Habitate für zahlreiche Insekten. Darunter befinden sich auch eine Vielzahl an gefährdeten Arten. Die meisten Studien über Insekten-Pflanzen Interaktionen an Pappel und Weiden konzentrieren sich auf nur zwei trophische Ebenen. Diese Stud! ien untersuchen vor allem den Einfluss von Unterschieden der chemischen Blattinhaltsstoffe auf pflanzenfressende Insekten. Die vorliegende Arbeit wurde in zwei Teile untergliedert. Ziel des ersten Teils der Arbeit war es Unterschiede in der Morphologie und der emittierten Blattduftstoffe zwischen nah verwanden Zitterpappel Kreuzungen zu charakterisieren. Ein weiteres Ziel war es herauszufinden, inwiefern die morphologischen und chemischen Merkmale der Bäume pflanzenfressende Insekten und deren natürliche Gegenspieler in natürlichen multitrophischen Interaktionen beeinflussen. Für die Untersuchungen wurden zwei verschiedene Freilandversuche etabliert, in denen eng verwandte Zitterpappel Kreuzungen (mit einer genetischen Distanz zwischen 6 51 \%) gepflanzt wurden Zitterpappeln. Wie erwartet unterschieden sich die Zitterpappeln der verschiedenen Kreuzungen in ihren morphologischen Merkmalen wie z.B. Baum-Höhe, Blattanzahl, etc. und in chemischen Merkmalen wie phenolischen Glykosiden. Im ersten der beiden Freilandversuche wurde ein negativer Zusammenhang zwischen phenolischen Glykosiden und pflanzenfressenden Insekten (z.B.: Phratora vulgatissima) festgestellt. Im zweiten Freilandversuch wurde herausgefunden, dass spezialisierte Blattkäfer und ihre Larven durch unterschiedliche morphologische Baummerkmale beeinflusst werden. Die Abundnaz der Imagines war positiv mit der Anzahl der Blätter pro Baum (Ressource Abundanz) korreliert, wohingegen ein negativer Zusammenhang zwischen der Baum-Höhe und Blattkäfer Larven gefunden wurde, Dieses Ergebnis steht im Gegensatz zur Pflanzen-Größe Hypothese nach Lawton. Durch Herbivoren induzierte Pflanzen Volatilen unterschieden sich in der Abgabemenge zwischen Frühling und Sommer. Es konnten aber weder Unterschiede zwischen den verschiedenen Kreuzungen noch durch verschiedene Herbivoren Abundanz festgestellt werden. Generalistische räuberische Arthropoden wurden indirekt durch genetische Unterschiede der Zitterpappeln (Kreuzungen) beeinflusst, indem ihre Anzahl positiv mit der Zahl der Herbivoren korreliert ist. Auch wurde festgestellt, dass es einen positiven Zusammenhang zwischen abgegebenen Herbivoren induzierten Pflanzen Volatilen und räuberischen Arthropoden gibt. Zusätzlich zeigten unsere Ergebnisse, dass es auf der Fläche eine räumlich-zeitliche Veränderung des Befalls der Bäume gab. Die im Frühjahr befallenen Bäume wurden von der zweiten Generation von Blattkäfern im Sommer gemieden, da diese vermutlich durch den Befall der ersten Blattkäfer Generation induzierte Resistenzen in den Blättern aufwiesen. Der zweite Teil der vorliegenden Arbeit basiert auf dem Wissen, dass räuberische Arthropoden oft sogenannte Infochemikalien als Signale nutzen um ihre Beute zu lokalisieren und zu finden. Diese Infochemikalien formen häufig multitrophische Interaktionen. Das Ziel der zwei Studien des zweiten Teils der vorliegenden Arbeit war die Untersuchung der olfaktorischen Reaktion von generalistischen und spezialisierten Prädatoren auf Volatilen die von ihrer Beute abgegeben werden und von Volatilen die von den Wirtbäumen der Beute abgegeben werden. Die Studien wurden in einem Freilandversuch und in Laborexperimenten (Olfaktometer Test und Elektroantennographie (EAG)) durchgeführt. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Studien zeigten die Ergebnisse, dass generalistische räubereische Käfer wie z.B. Harmonia axyridis von Salicylaldehyd, der Abwehr Substanz Salicin sequestrierender Käferlarven, angezogen wurden. Dieses Ergebnis lässt vermuten, dass H. axyridis Imagines in der Lage sind zu lernen Salicylaldehyd als Lockstoff zu nutzen. Die Ergebnisse der EAG Experimente indizieren, dass spezialisierte räuberische Lehmwespen (Eumeninae) in der Lage sind Salicylaldehyd und von Herbivoren induzierte Pflanzen Volatilen wahrzunehmen. Des Weiteren spiegelte die olfaktorische Wahrnehmungsfähigkeit den Grad der Beute-Spezialisierung der drei verschiedenen Wespen Arten wieder. Zusammenfassend konnte gezeigt werden, dass direkte und indirekte Effekte die Interaktionen zwischen Zitterpappeln und Insekten beeinflussen und formen. Zitterpappeln beeinflussen pflanzenfressende Insekten sowohl direkt durch morphologische, chemische und genetische Merkmale als auch indirekt durch räumliche Verbreitung und zeitliche Veränderungen (induzierte Resistenz). Ähnlich sind Prädatoren von Zitterpappeln direkt durch Herbivoren induzierte Pflanzen Volatilen und indirekt durch die Anzahl von Herbivoren auf den Bäumen beeinflusst. Darüber hinaus beeinflussen Infochemikalien, abgegeben von Beutetieren, generalistische und spezialisierte Prädatoren in dem tritrophischen System bestehend aus Populus tremula, spezialisierten Blattkäfern, deren Larven und ihren Prädatoren. ; A drastic increase of global energy consumption is expected for the following years. Due to the increasing demand for renewable energy, much of the current research focuses on short-rotation forestry with high productive Salix and Populus species as a potential energy source. In this context the European aspen (Populus tremula) gained importance for biomass production, because of its ability to reach considerable growth rates even on poor soils and under unfavourable habitat conditions. The European aspen is a pioneer species and is one of the most widespread tree species in boreal and temperate forests. On natural sites aspen create habitats for a rich arthropod community including many endangered species. Current knowledge in plant-insect interactions of willows and poplars is based on studies, which are mostly concentrated on only two trophic levels and differences in leaf chemistry affecting phytophagous insects. The aim of the first part of this thesis was to characterize the differences between closely related aspen (P. tremula) full-sib families and to examine the influence of their morphological and chemical traits on herbivorous insects and their natural enemies in real-world multitrophic interactions. Thereto two common garden experiments were established with closely related aspen full-sib families (6 - 51 \% genetic distance). As hypothesized the aspen full-sib families differed in morphological traits such as tree height and leaf number as well as in leaf chemical traits such as phenolic glycosides. In the first common garden experiment a negative relationship was found between phenolic glycosides and chewing herbivorous insects (e.g. Phratora vulgatissima). In the second common garden experiment specialist leaf beetles and their larvae were influenced by different morphological tree traits. The imagines were positively related to the number of leaves (i.e. the resource abundance), whereas leaf beetle larvae were negatively related to tree height, which is in contrast to Lawton s plant size hypothesis. Herbivore-induced plant volatiles differed between spring and summer, but did not change with aspen genetics or herbivore load. Generalist predatory arthropods were indirectly affected by genetic aspen differences as their abundance closely followed the abundance of leaf beetle adults and larvae. They were also positively directly related to emitted herbivore-induced plant volatiles. In addition, after the colonization of one half of the experimental field in spring our results revealed a spatio-temporal shift to the second field half in summer, presumably due to avoidance of tree leaves with induced responses because of the spring infestation. The second part of the thesis is based on the knowledge that predatory arthropods often use infochemical cues for host finding and host location and that multitrophic interactions are often shaped by such infochemicals. The aim of the two studies of the second part was to investigate the olfaction ability of generalist and specialist predatory insects of volatiles emitted by their prey and the prey s host plants and the effects of these volatiles to the predators. This was tested with a field study and laboratory experiments (olfactometer tests and elctroantennography (EAG)). In contrast to recent studies our results showed that generalist predatory beetles such as Harmonia axyridis were attracted by salicylaldehyde, the defense compound of salicin-using leaf beetle larvae. The results further suggest that H. axyridis imagines can learn to use salicylaldehyde as an attractant. The results of EAG experiments indicate that specialist predatory eumenid wasps are able to perceive salicylaldehyde and herbivore-induced plant volatiles and that the olfaction ability reflects the degree of prey specialisation of the different wasp species.We conclude that direct and indirect effects shape aspen-insect interactions. Aspen influence herbivorous insects directly via plant morphological, chemical and genetic traits as well as indirectly via their spatial distribution and temporal changes. Predators are likewise directly influenced by aspen via emitted herbivore-induced plant volatiles and indirectly via herbivore abundances on the trees. Furthermore, infochemicals emitted by their prey affect generalist and specialist predators in the tritrophic system consisting of Populus tremula, specialist leaf beetles, their larvae and their predators.},

	url = {https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03330902},
	abstract = {International audience ; In response to damage by insects, plants release herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) into the air. Insectivorous birds exploit these cues and, consequently, reduce the damages inflicted to the plants. However, little is known about whether they solely use HIPVs as foraging cues, or if they also use them to modulate traits linked to reproduction. As caterpillars are the primary food source required for insectivorous birds to raise offspring, their ability to locate and predict future peaks in caterpillar biomass using olfaction is likely to be advantageous. Therefore, we tested whether an insectivorous songbird that naturally inhabits oak dominated forests can be trained to detect early spring infestation by hatchling caterpillars, at a time when oaks begin bursting, and birds prepare to breed. Tree buds were either infested with caterpillars or left as a control and visually obscured in a Y-Maze choice test. Additionally, we measured testosterone and 17β-estradiol as they influence olfactory perception in mammals and are linked to reproduction in vertebrates. After being trained to associate the presence of HIPVs with that of food, blue tits spent more time with, were more active around, and more frequently chose to first visit the infested trees, showing that blue tits can smell caterpillar activity. Males with higher testosterone spent more time around infested trees, suggesting that foraging behavior during the pre-breeding season is linked with a major reproductive signal. There was no relationship between foraging and estradiol in females. These results are an important foundation for further investigation of the role of hormones in avian olfaction and how smell may be useful for making breeding decisions that could improve reproductive success.},

	abstract = {In response to herbivory, plants synthesize and release variable mixtures of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) as indirect defense traits. Such induction of indirect plant defense can also be “switched on” by certain chemicals known as priming agents. Preceding work showed that the plant HIPV cis-jasmone (CJ) induced the emission of aphid defense-related volatiles affecting their behavioral response. However, little is known about the extent to which CJ-induced volatiles impacts aphid performance. In the current study, we conducted growth assays of potato aphids, Macrosiphum euphorbiae, observing their reproduction, development, and survival on CJ-primed potato plants. Adult M. euphoribae produced fewer neonates on CJ-treated plants compared to untreated plants. The weight and survival of M. euphorbiae reproduced neonates were significantly lower on CJ-treated plants. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in mean relative growth rate (MRGR) of M. euphoribae nymphs that fed on CJ-treated plants. Furthermore, the intrinsic rate of population increase (rm) of M. euphoribae was significantly reduced on CJ-treated plants. Volatile analysis showed that CJ treatment significantly increased the emission of differently assigned volatile groups that have functional or biosynthetic characteristics, i.e., alcohols, benzenoids, homoterpenes, ketones, and sesquiterpenes at all sampling periods. Such enhanced volatile emissions were persistent over 7 days, suggesting a long-lasting effect of CJ defense priming. A negative correlation was found between volatile emission and MRGR of M. euphoribae. Principal component analysis (PCA) of data for the volatiles showed that (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, α-pinene, (E)-ocimene, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), cis-jasmone, indole, and (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene (TMTT) were the main volatiles contributing to the emitted blends, suggesting possible involvement in the reduced performance of M. euphorbiae. Overall, our findings demonstrate that priming potato with CJ significantly results in elevated emission of known biologically active volatiles, which may negatively impact aphid settling and other performance traits on primed plants.},

	abstract = {Kairomones are chemical signals that mediate interspecific interactions beneficial to organisms that detect the cues. These attractants can be individual compounds or mixtures of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) or herbivore chemicals such as pheromones, i.e., chemicals mediating intraspecific communication between herbivores. Natural enemies eavesdrop on kairomones during their foraging behaviour, i.e., location of oviposition sites and feeding resources in nature. Kairomone mixtures are likely to elicit stronger olfactory responses in natural enemies than single kairomones. Kairomone-based lures are used to enhance biological control strategies via the attraction and retention of natural enemies to reduce insect pest populations and crop damage in an environmentally friendly way. In this review, we focus on ways to improve the efficiency of kairomone use in crop fields. First, we highlight kairomone sources in tri-trophic systems and discuss how these attractants are used by natural enemies searching for hosts or prey. Then we summarise examples of field application of kairomones (pheromones vs. HIPVs) in recruiting natural enemies. We highlight the need for future field studies to focus on the application of kairomone blends rather than single kairomones which currently dominate the literature on field attractants for natural enemies. We further discuss ways for improving kairomone use through attract and reward technique, olfactory associative learning, and optimisation of kairomone lure formulations. Finally, we discuss why the effectiveness of kairomone use for enhancing biological control strategies should move from demonstration of increase in the number of attracted natural enemies, to reducing pest populations and crop damage below economic threshold levels and increasing crop yield.},

	abstract = {International audience ; Phytohormones emitted into the atmosphere perform many functions relating to the defence, pollination and competitiveness of plants. To be effective, their atmospheric lifetimes must be sufficient that these signals can be delivered to their numerous recipients.We investigate the atmospheric loss processes for methyl salicylate (MeSA), a widely emitted plant volatile. Simulation chambers were used to determine gas-phase reaction rates with OH, NO3, Cl and O3; photolysis rates; and deposition rates of gas-phase MeSA onto organic aerosols. Room temperature rate coefficients are determined (in units of cm3 molecule-1 s-1) to be (3.20±0.46)×10-12, (4.19±0.92)×10-15, (1.65±0.44)×10-12 and (3.33±2.01)×10-19 for the reactions with OH, NO3, Cl and O3 respectively. Photolysis is negligible in the actinic range, despite having a large reported near-UV chromophore. Conversely, aerosol uptake can be competitive with oxidation under humid conditions, suggesting that this compound has a high affinity for hydrated surfaces. A total lifetime of gas-phase MeSA of 1–4 days was estimated based on all these loss processes. The competing sinks of MeSA demonstrate the need to assess lifetimes of semiochemicals holistically, and we gain understanding of how atmospheric sinks influence natural communication channels within complex multitrophic interactions. This approach can be extended to other compounds that play vital roles in ecosystems, such as insect pheromones, which may be similarly affected during atmospheric transport.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8106584/},
	abstract = {In ecosystems, plants are continuously challenged by combined stress conditions more than by a single biotic or abiotic factor. Consequently, in recent years studies on plant relationships with multiple stresses have aroused increasing interest. Here, the impact of inoculation with fungal pathogens with different lifestyles on Arabidopsis plants response to the following infestation with the invasive crop pest Eurydema oleracea was investigated. In particular, as fungal pathogens the necrotroph Botrytis cinerea and the biotroph Golovinomyces orontii were used. Plants exposed to B. cinerea, but not to G. orontii, showed reduced herbivore feeding damage. This difference was associated to different hormonal pathways triggered by the pathogens: G. orontii only induced the salicylate-mediated pathway, while B. cinerea stimulated also the jasmonate-dependent signalling, which persisted for a long time providing a long-term defence to further herbivore attack. In particular, the lower susceptibility of B. cinerea-infected Arabidopsis plants to E. oleracea was related to the stimulation of the JA-induced pathway on the production of plant volatile compounds, since treatment with VOCs emitted by B. cinerea inoculated plants inhibited both insect plant choice and feeding damage. These results indicate that necrotrophic plant pathogenic fungi modulate host volatile emission, thus affecting plant response to subsequent insect, thereby increasing the knowledge on tripartite plant–microbe–insect interactions in nature.},

	abstract = {Research Highlights : We demonstrated that the resistance mechanisms of plants could be used to combat damage caused by pests in forestry plantations. Background and Objectives : Poplar is the main tree species used in plantations in northern China, with Micromelalopha sieversi (Staudinger) representing a major pest species causing defoliation. Here, we investigated whether two poplar clones could resist this pest species and the physiological mechanisms involved. Materials and Methods : Two clones of Populus from section Aigeiros were used, with ‘108’ ( P. × euramericana ‘Guariento’) being more attractive to M. sieversi than ‘111’ ( P. × euramericana ‘Bellotto’). Three treatments were set up (oviposited plants, neighboring plants, and control plants) to determine whether resistance was induced in plants neighboring oviposited plants. Results : Significantly fewer eggs were oviposited on neighboring plants compared to control plants for both clones, with more eggs being laid on oviposited and control plants of ‘108’ compared to ‘111’. β-Pinene was detected in oviposited and neighboring plants, but not control plants for either clone. Significantly higher concentrations of 3-carene was present in oviposited and neighboring plants of ‘108’ and ‘111’ compared to control plants at 24, 48, and 72 h after oviposition. Males, females, and mated females primarily responded to electroantennogram (EAG), methyl palmitate and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate at 50 ng/μL, and to 3-carene and β-pinene at 5 ng/μL, and to styrene at 10 ng/μL in EAG assays. When using these concentrations on plant leaves, 3-carene, β-pinene, and styrene significantly reduced the number of eggs laid on ‘108’, while 3-carene and β-pinene were effective for ‘111’. Conclusions : Plants neighboring oviposited plants exhibited defense responses; 3-carene and β-pinene were used to transmit chemical signals (volatile cues) from oviposited plants to neighboring plants; which induced neighboring plants released volatiles as a defense mechanism to prevent egg laying.},

	abstract = {Herbivory may affect important plant traits that mediate the interaction with floral visitors and potential pollinators with consequences to fruit and seed production. These may occur through varied mechanisms, ranging from a trade-off in resource allocation for defense and reproduction, to pleiotropic effects in the biosynthesis of secondary compounds for plant defense and floral attractiveness. The subject has been receiving attention and is leading to new perspectives in the study of ecology and evolution of insect-plant interactions. Here our main goal is to briefly review the scientific literature and discuss theoretical aspects of plant mediation of interactions between herbivores and pollinators. We conducted an extensive but non-systematic search for literature on the main theme “effects of herbivory on floral visitors and pollination”. We found experimental studies and reviews reporting that foliar and floral herbivory usually change floral traits that mediate plant-pollinator interactions. The effect of herbivores on floral visitation tend to be neutral or negative, and does not always lead to negative impacts on seed production. These results open a path for new hypotheses on how plants may avoid or compensate for possible ecological costs of herbivory. We suggest that future studies should explore finer mechanisms through which herbivory affects pollination by considering natural history, pollination effectiveness, and the chemical background upon which flowers are presented to pollinators. Such studies will improve our understanding of how indirect effects structure ecological communities and their role in the evolution of plant-animal interactions.},

	url = {https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/9141/},
	abstract = {Insect herbivores orient towards host plants using sensory cues and olfaction plays a major role, especially in nocturnal herbivores, during selection of host plants suitable for feeding, mating and oviposition. Plants defend themselves from herbivore feeding by producing volatiles as well as non-volatiles chemical compounds. Volatile compounds produced in response to feeding damage by herbivores are commonly referred to as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Emissions of HIPVs are ecologically important as they can increase plant resistance by repelling herbivores and by attracting the natural enemies of the herbivores. We observed a significant reduction in mating when male and female Spodoptera littoralis moths were allowed to mate in the presence of damaged cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) plants. Male activation and attraction towards female sex pheromone was reduced in the presence herbivore-damaged cotton plants. Similarly, females kept individually with damaged cotton plants spent less time in calling compared to females on undamaged plants. These results provide first evidence that herbivore-induced changes in host plants can affect calling and mating behaviours of an insect herbivore. In behavioural studies, in the laboratory as well as in the field, we showed that HIPV emissions from damaged cotton plant neighbours provide resistance to undamaged plants within both conspecific and heterospecific plant patches. Furthermore we found that associational resistance through HIPVs is unidirectional and is highly specific among the tested plant species. Undamaged cotton and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) plants in patches with damaged cotton plant neighbours received fewer eggs, whereas we found no associational resistance when damaged alfalfa and clover (Trifolium alexandrinum) neighbours were present. Electrophysiological (GC-EAD) studies showed that the antennae of the mated female S. littoralis moths detected 18 compounds among the headspace collections of HIPVs from damaged cotton plants. Behavioural studies showed that a blend of seven de novo synthesized volatile compounds among GC-EAD active compounds were sufficient to repel ovipositing S. littoralis. Our results suggest that de novo synthesized volatile compounds provide signalling cues to ovipositing female moths that the plants are under herbivore attack and can be used as reliable cues to avoid plants of low food quality and to reduce risk for competition and predation. Our studies show that HIPVs can have large effect on both male and female reproductive behaviours and that it can affect ecological interactions.},

	abstract = {Concentration of air pollutants, particularly ozone (O 3 ), has dramatically increased since pre-industrial times in the troposphere. Due to the strong oxidative potential of O 3 , negative effects on both emission and lifetime in the atmosphere of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have already been highlighted. VOCs alteration by O 3 may potentially affect the attraction of pollinators that rely on these chemical signals. Surprisingly, direct effects of O 3 on the olfaction and the behavioral response of pollinators have not been investigated so far. We developed a comprehensive experiment under controlled conditions to assess O 3 physiological and behavioral effects on two pollinator species, differing in their ecological traits. Using several realistic concentrations of O 3 and various exposure times, we investigated the odor antennal detection and the attraction to VOCs present in the floral scents of their associated plants. Our results showed, in both species, a clear effect of exposure to high O 3 concentrations on the ability to detect and react to the floral VOCs. These effects depend on the VOC tested and its concentration, and the O 3 exposure (concentration and duration) on the pollinator species. Pollination systems may, therefore, be impaired in different ways by increased levels of O 3 , the effects of which will likely depend on whether the exposure is chronic or, as in this study, punctual, likely causing some pollination systems to be more vulnerable than others. While several studies have already shown the negative impact of O 3 on VOCs emission and lifetime in the atmosphere, this study reveals, for the first time, that this impact alters the pollinator detection and behavior. These findings highlight the urgent need to consider air pollution when evaluating threats to pollinators.},

	abstract = {Volatile compounds and extrafloral nectar are common defenses of wild plants; however, in crops they bear an as-yet underused potential for biological control of pests and diseases. Odor emission and nectar secretion are multigene traits in wild plants, and thus form difficult targets for breeding. Furthermore, domestication has changed the capacity of crops to express these traits. We propose that breeding crops for an enhanced capacity for tritrophic interactions and volatile-mediated direct resistance to herbivores and pathogens can contribute to environmentally-friendly and sustainable agriculture. Natural plant volatiles with antifungal or repellent properties can serve as direct resistance agents. In addition, volatiles mediating tritrophic interactions can be combined with nectar-based food rewards for carnivores to boost indirect plant defense. Domestication and Biocontrol Crop domestication aims to enhance the quality of plants for human use. In addition to yield, domestication (see Glossary) most commonly has altered the size, taste, and nutritional quality of the plant parts of interest, favoring synchronous ripening, homogenous plant sizes, apical dominance, determinate growth, indehiscent fruits, or other characteristics of relevance for cultivation and harvesting, as well as modifying traits that facilitate transport and storage Many resistance-related traits are inducible Trends Hundreds of studies convincingly demonstrate functioning indirect defenses in wild plants, but breeding approaches have never considered the underlying traits (e.g., food rewards or shelter for carnivores, and volatiles that mediate information-based interactions) as desirable targets. We argue that induced plant volatiles, owing to their multiple roles as signals, repellents, and antimicrobial compounds, bear an as-yet underused potential for biological control, and that future breeding efforts should enhance the capacity of crops to engage in tritrophic interactions. We also present ecological and evolutionary considerations that can explain why the constitutive release of volatile compounds that have evolved as inducible defenses is not likely to work, and why extrafloral nectar is likely to represent a better food reward for carnivores than floral nectar. TRPLSC 1335 No. of Pages 15 to genetically engineer wheat (Triticum aestivum) for the emission of an aphid alarm pheromone as a means to enhance repellence of aphids and attract aphid carnivores). We highlight the major defensive functions of VOCs and EFN, discuss why VOCs and EFN are rarely included in breeding programs, and propose how and to what degree these traits can be optimized to allow better biological control of pests and crop diseases. Plant VOCs, EFN, and Biological Control Plants express multiple traits that provide resistance to the majority of potential herbivores and pathogens [29]. Many traits act directly against these enemies via their toxic, repellent, or antimicrobial effects or function as mechanical barriers, but other resistance strategies work indirectly [18]. For example, plants release an array of VOCs when damaged [30][31][32], and the particular blends depend on the type of wound and even the type of attacker [33,34]. Because such induced VOCs frequently indicate the presence of a herbivore, they are utilized by many carnivores as cues to find their prey, a behavior that can reduce herbivore loads and thus cause 'indirect' defense of the plants [35]. Studies searching for beneficial effects of VOCs have reported multiple promising observations In addition to VOCs, plants commonly attract and maintain carnivores by offering shelter (such as domatia in the form of cavities or trichome tufts for ants and mites) or food rewards [such as pollen, floral nectar (FN), extrafloral nectar (EFN), and plant sap] [18]. These rewards contain carbohydrates and amino acids, and are consumed by a diverse range of carnivores [18], most frequently during the adult stage [19,[45][46][47]. In particular, the ingestion of nectar enhances the longevity and predatory efficiency of carnivores or reduces intraguild predation [48][49][50]. These food rewards affect the performance, behavior, and voracity of carnivores [19,45,[47][48][49], an effect that can be used to optimize the efficacy of biological control by using plant genotypes of a desired quality [51]. In particular, the secretion of EFN usually reduces herbivory on the respective plants [52][53][54]. In the horticultural context, there are reports of enhanced protection from herbivores in plants that secrete EFN [22,55,56], produce large amounts of pollen [57], or provide additional shelter to ants or predatory mites [58]. The availability of carbohydrates is a common bottleneck for carnivores, whereas herbivores are usually limited by the supply of Glossary In addition to their direct antimicrobial properties, such VOCs are known to trigger resistance responses in remote parts of the same plant or in neighboring plants Putative Functions of VOCs in Biological Control In most cases, biological control makes use of native or alien natural enemies of herbivores such as predators and parasitoids. Common strategies to enhance the populations of these carnivores in agricultural or horticultural environments aim at conserving the natural populations of these animals, attracting them from adjacent natural areas, or via the active release of commercially reared animals. Although biological pest control represents an environmentally-friendly strategy that has had tremendous success in particular systems, its wider success is frequently limited by various intrinsic problems. First, carnivores that are released in open areas often disperse to adjacent, more natural ecosystems (see examples in The discovery of the above-mentioned VOCs seemed to open new possibilities for biological control [42]. These 'semiochemicals' or 'infochemicals' can be used by carnivores as hostfinding cues [18,32], and can be released artificially [41,42,44, (i) Plant VOCs play multiple roles in direct resistance to herbivores and pathogens, which makes it unlikely that strategies that focus on one single mechanism can be successful. Apparently for historic reasons, most work has focused on VOC-mediated tritrophic interactions [15]. However, identifying the traits that currently limit the successful engagement of many crops in successful tritrophic interactions will help to breed future cultivars for the capacity to express the traits in question. Therefore, it is our ambition to inspire plant breeders to consider tritrophic interactions and inducible resistance to a greater extent [27, Domestication Affects the Quality of Plants for Friends and Foes Many of the traits that confer direct resistance to pests have been counter-selected during domestication, either because they depend on undesirable properties such as bitterness, hairiness, toughness, or toxicity, and thus reduce the quality of the consumed parts, or because they cause a yield penalty as a consequence of the metabolic costs of resistance expression Unfortunately, we know rather little on how domestication has affected the indirect defense of crops via tritrophic interactions By contrast, cultivated genotypes of bean (Phaseolus coccineus) and cabbage (Brassica oleracea) were more attractive to parasitoids than related wild species Plants transformed or mutated in a single gene exhibited changes in GLVs, terpenoids, or glucosinolate-related compounds, with subsequent effect on both herbivores and their natural enemies (see [27] for overview), and plants can even be transformed to emit insect alarm pheromones, an approach that might enhance direct resistance via repellence [28]. EFN is restricted to specific plant taxa and is secreted by specific structures, properties that make it more demanding to breed a specific crop for this type of reward. However, breeders could make use of existing genetic variation in crops such as cotton, salicaceous trees, and all the fruiting shrubs and trees in the Rosaceae that bear extrafloral nectaries (http://biosci-labs.unl.edu/Emeriti/ keeler/extrafloral/worldlistfamilies.htm). Finally, the chemical composition of plant saps that can be used as favorable rewards for omnivores is less known, and should be explored further for breeding purposes. In summary, genetic variability exists in traits that underlie indirect defense, but deeper knowledge will be required before directed genetic improvements become feasible. Biological Control as a Goal in Plant Breeding: Obstacles and Risks All the examples in Biological Control as a Goal in Plant Breeding: Recommendations We present a list of recommendations for how best to integrate tritrophic interactions in breeding efforts and crop management (see Box 1 for a short overview). Based on the reports on beneficial effects of plant VOCs and reward-based indirect defenses Concluding Remarks However, new regulations and changing consumer demands are gradually improving the prospects for more sustainable agriculture. For example, European Parliament directive 2009/128/EG made the implementation of integrated pest management obligatory within the EU from 2014. Thus, there are several trends towards increased acceptance of 'good enough' solutions to pest problems. Indeed, two breeding projects already target natural enemies of pests. In the SAMBA project (www.samba-webb.se), plant breeders collaborated with insect ecologists to identify willow traits that attract and reward natural enemies of detrimental leaf beetles Based on the considerations outlined in this paper, we stress the importance of including both information-based and reward-based plant traits to achieve functioning tritrophic defense, and of exploring the direct resistance-related functions of VOCs, which could allow biocontrol of pests and pathogens independently of the third trophic level. The 'attract-and-reward' concept and the direct defensive effects of plants VOCs provide a useful framework for the design of biocontrol strategies that can allow sustainable and cost-efficient protection of our crops. The resulting benefits are potentially very large, and data on the net-outcomes of specific strategies in realistic agronomic and horticultural environments can be obtained quickly.},

	abstract = {[EN] Background: For as long as 350 million years, plants and insects have coexisted and developed a set of relationships which affect both organisms at different levels. Plants have evolved various morphological and biochemical adaptations to cope with herbivores attacks. However, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) has become the major pest threatening tomato crops worldwide and without the appropriated management it can cause production losses between 80 to 100\%. Results: The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo effect of a serine proteinase inhibitor (BTI-CMe) and a cysteine proteinase inhibitor (Hv-CPI2) from barley on this insect and to examine the effect their expression has on tomato defensive response. We found that larvae fed on the double transgenic plants showed a notable reduction in weight. Moreover, only 56\% of the larvae reached the adult stage. The emerged adults showed wings deformities and reduced fertility. We also investigated the effect of proteinase inhibitors ingestion on the insect digestive enzymes. Our results showed a decrease in larval trypsin activity. Transgenes expression had no harmful effect on Nesidiocoris tenuis (Reuter) (Heteroptera: Miridae), a predator of Tuta absoluta, despite transgenic tomato plants attracted the mirid. We also found that barley cystatin expression promoted plant defense by inducing the expression of the tomato endogenous wound inducible Proteinase inhibitor 2 (Pin2) gene, increasing the production of glandular trichomes and altering the emission of volatile organic compounds. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the usefulness of the co-expression of different proteinase inhibitors for the enhancement of plant resistance to Tuta absoluta. ; This work was partly supported by grants BIO2013-40747-R and AGL2014-55616-C3 from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) ; Hamza, R.; Pérez-Hedo, M.; Urbaneja, A.; Rambla Nebot, JL.; Granell Richart, A.; Gaddour, K.; Beltran Porter, JP.

El chinche de las resinas Heniartes stali se encuentra con frecuencia en esta planta recogiendo el exudado con sus patas delanteras para mejorar su capacidad en la captura de las presas. En este trabajo empleamos microscopía de luz y microscopía electrónica de barrido para describir la morfología de los tricomas. Los constituyentes químicos del exudado fueron estudiados mediante técnicas histoquímicas, de cromatografía de gases y espectrometría de masas. También combinamos observaciones del comportamiento del insecto en la recolección y almacenamiento del exudado con el análisis de la morfología de sus patas, empleando microscopía de luz y microscopía electrónica de barrido para identificar las posibles adaptaciones morfo-funcionales desarrolladas para la manipulación de estas secreciones adhesivas. Los tricomas glandulares exhibieron un tallo largo multicelular y una cabeza glandular en forma de cáliz con células alineadas radialmente. El fluido resinoso estaba compuesto principalmente por terpenos y compuestos fenólicos, los cuales parecen contribuir con sus propiedades adhesivas. La presencia de estructuras tipo pincel en las puntas de las tibias de las patas delanteras sugieren un carácter adaptativo para recoger el exudado de los tricomas. También describimos un área en las patas traseras profusamente cubierta de pelos, que funcionaban como estructuras de almacenamiento de la resina. En la cutícula de éstas observamos abundantes aberturas similares a poros y sugerimos que a través de ellos se secretan sustancias que impiden el endurecimiento de la resina almacenada. Estos hallazgos aportan información sobre características morfológicas y químicas de un novedoso modelo de interacción insecto-planta en el neotrópico. ; Rubus adenotrichos is an Andean blackberry plant bearing glandular trichomes which secrete an adhesive exudate. The resin bug Heniartes stali is frequently found on this plant and collects this exudate using the forelegs to enhance its preying capacity. Here, we describe the morphology of the plant’s glandular trichomes with the aid of light and scanning electron microscopy, as well as the chemical components of the exudate by histochemical and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. We have also combined behavioral observations with the analysis of the insect leg morphology to identify possible morpho-functional adaptations evolved by H. stali for collecting the sticky secretions. Glandular trichomes exhibited a multicellular long stalk and a calyx-shaped head with radially aligned cells. The composition of the resinous fluid was mainly terpenes and phenolics, which may contribute to its sticky properties. Brush-like structures on the tibia of forelegs in H. stali suggests an adaptive trait for collecting the trichomes exudate. A profusely hair-covered area on metatibiae operated as a resin storage structure. Abundant pore-like openings were observed in the cuticle of this area through which substances could be conceivably secreted to prevent resin hardening. These findings combine morphological and chemical features of a fascinating insect-plant interaction in the Neotropics.},

	abstract = {Ilustraciones, tablas y fotografías ; En Colombia, el cultivo de palma de aceite ha representado, desde 1960, uno de los cultivos agroindustriales de mayor importancia debido a su gran productividad. Actualmente, el país es el cuarto productor de aceite de palma a nivel mundial, y el primero en América, con más de 550 mil hectáreas de palma sembrada. Colombia cuenta con cuatro zonas palmeras, de las cuales la zona oriental representa el 41\% del total de hectáreas sembradas. Tal como suele suceder en el campo agrícola, este cultivo, y principalmente el de la zona oriental, se ve afectado por enfermedades y plagas, entre las cuales se encuentra el Strategus aloeus, comúnmente conocido como escarabajo torito. Considerando las serias repercusiones económicas resultantes de la infestación de los cultivos por este insecto, en el 2015 el ICA declaró esta especie como plaga de control oficial. Una de las tácticas del Manejo Integrado de Plagas (MIP) consiste en el control etológico a través del uso de semioquímicos o compuestos orgánicos volátiles (VOCs) que actúan como modificadores del comportamiento de la plaga. Para el S. aloeus, la feromona reportada por Rochat et al. (2000) no ha sido efectiva en campo. Por lo tanto, persiste la necesidad de seguir estudiando los semioquímicos de esta especie. Este estudio se realizó con el objetivo de identificar los semioquímicos responsables de las interacciones en el sistema hospedero-huésped, constituido por la palma de aceite (Elaeis guineensis) y el insecto-plaga Strategus aloeus. Para tal fin, la investigación cubrió las siguientes etapas: extracción de los volátiles liberados por la planta hospedera y por los individuos machos de S. aloeus; separación, análisis e identificación de los VOCs mediante cromatografía de gases acoplada a espectrometría de masas; y, validación de algunos VOCs mediante la evaluación de la respuesta electrofisiológica y comportamental de los insectos frente a los compuestos identificados. Mediante las extracciones por Headspace Micro Extracción en Fase Sólida (HS-MEFS) y Headspace Dinámico (HSD) se identificaron 45 VOCs liberados por la palma de aceite (E. guineensis), alimento y hospedero natural del S. aloeus. Entre los cuales se identificaron la 2-butanona y la 3-pentanona, cetonas previamente reportadas por Rochat et al. (2000) como constituyentes de la feromona del insecto, lo que indicó su participación en la interacción interespecífica. Por medio de la extracción directa con hexano de las glándulas, en los insectos adultos de S. aloeus se identificaron el 2,4,7,9-tetrametil-5-decin-4,7-diol, el 4-metiloctanoato de etilo y el acetato de sec-butilo como VOCs macho-específicos de esta especie. La respuesta comportamental de insectos adultos de ambos sexos de S. aloeus frente a estos tres compuestos, solos o en mezcla, demostró su atracción significativa, lo que sugiere su participación en la interacción intraespecífica, es decir, como feromona de la especie. Los semioquímicos identificados en la interacción Elaeis guineensis- Strategus aloeus representan una alternativa para ser incorporados en el MIP de esta plaga en cultivos de palma de aceite, por lo que se recomienda su evaluación en campo. (Texto tomado de la fuente). ; The oil palm has been one of the most important agro-industrial crops in Colombia since 1960, due to its high productivity. Currently, the country is the fourth largest palm oil producer in the world, and the first in the Americas, with more than 550,000 hectares of plantations. Colombia has four palm-growing zones, of which the eastern zone accounts for 41\% of the total planted area. As is often the case in the agricultural field, this crop, and mainly in the eastern zone, is affected by diseases and pests, including the Strategus aloeus, commonly known as the bull beetle. The serious economic repercussions resulting from S. aloeus infestation led ICA, in 2015, to declare this species as subject to official control. One of the tactics of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) consists of ethological control through the use of semiochemicals or volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that act as pest behavior modifiers. For S. aloeus, the pheromone reported by Rochat et al. (2000) has not been effective in the field. Thus further study of the semiochemicals of this species is required. This study was designed to identify the semiochemicals responsible for interactions in the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) host-host system with the pest insect Strategus aloeus. To this end, the research covered the following stages: extraction of volatiles released by the host plant and by male S. aloeus individuals; separation, analysis and identification of VOCs by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry; and, validation of some VOCs by evaluating the electrophysiological and behavioral response of insects to the identified compounds. In Headspace Solid Phase Micro Extraction (HS-SPME) and Dynamic Headspace (DHS) extractions 45 VOCs released by oil palm (E. guineensis), a food source and natural host of S. aloeus, were identified. Among them, 2-butanone and 3-pentanone, ketones previously reported by Rochat et al. (2000) as constituents of the insect pheromone, were identified, indicating their participation in the interspecific interaction. By direct hexane extraction from glands, 2,4,7,9-tetramethyl-5-decyne-4,7-diol, ethyl 4-methyloctanoate and sec-butyl acetate were identified as male-specific VOCs in adult S. aloeus insects. The behavioral response of adult S. aloeus insects of both sexes to these three compounds alone or in mixture showed their significant attraction, suggesting their involvement in intraspecific interaction, i.e., as a pheromone specific to the specie. The semiochemicals identified in the Elaeis guineensis-Strategus aloeus interaction constitute an alternative for incorporation in the IPM of this pest in oil palm crops, hence their evaluation in the field is recommended.

	abstract = {Baccharis spicata (Asteraceae) e Schinus polygamus (Anacardiaceae) são plantas nativas do Rio Grande do Sul e são hospedeiras de dois psilídeos galhadores (Hemiptera, Psyllidae) ainda não identificados. As duas plantas em estudo produzem óleo essencial e seus compostos voláteis podem ter um importante papel na interação inseto-planta. A extração e análise dos voláteis das folhas, folhas galhadas e galhas foram realizadas por microextração em fase sólida no modo "headspace" e por cromatografia gasosa com detector de espectrometria de massas. Verificou-se que a composição do "headspace" das galhas de B. spicata e S. polygamus é diferente daquela do "headspace" das folhas sadias. A principal alteração observada foi o aumento da contribuição de monoterpenos no "headspace" das galhas comparativamente ao que se verificou nos tecidos saudáveis. Algumas mudanças também foram observadas na produção de voláteis verdes, em ambas as espécies, mas especialmente na S. polygamus. O possível papel ecológico desses compostos químicos também é discutido. Baccharis spicata (Asteraceae) and Schinus polygamus (Anacardiaceae) are plants native from Rio Grande do Sul and are hosts of two unidentified galling psyllids (Hemiptera, Psyllidae). Both plant species produce essential oil and their volatile compounds play an important role related to this kind of plant-insect interaction. Extraction and analysis of volatiles produced by leaves, galled leaves and galls were performed using headspace solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detector. Composition of the headspace of B. spicata and S. polygamus galls showed a significant change in their volatile profile when compared to healthy leaves. These changes were mainly related to a higher production of monoterpenes in galled tissue, compared to what was found in healthy samples. Some changes on the production of green leaf volatiles were also observed in both plant species, especially in S. polygamus. The possible ecological role of these chemical changes was discussed. Keywords: galls, leaves, Baccharis spicata, Schinus polygamus, headspace solid phase microextraction Introduction Galls are the result of histological alterations in plant organs, mainly hypertrophy and hyperplasy, caused by the activity of an inductor which can be virus, bacteria, nematodes, insects and other plants. These organisms can interfere with the normal development of cells and tissues leading to several physiological and morphological changes. Gall-inducing insects (insect gallmakers) are masters in the art of beguiling or compelling the host plant to provide food and shelter with a minimum expenditure of effort on their part and galls induced by insect are one of most diverse plant galls. 1 Galls are found on all plant organs, such as flowers, leaves, stems and roots. They provide food and shelter to the inducer which lives in a microenvironment relatively safe from natural enemies. 2 The leaf galls are variable in form and occur in the majority of plant hosts. 2 Plant volatiles can act as chemical signals to herbivores and its biosynthesis can be changed as a response to herbivory. 3,4 Some of these metabolites can act as signals to insects for plant host finding and recognition 7 Damasceno et al. 557 Vol. 21, No. 3, 2010 The signaling phenomenon is well known when dealing with free-living herbivore insect. Baccharis (Asteraceae) posses more than 500 species distributed mainly in the tropical areas of South America. 12 Approximately 120 of them are found in Brazil and around 70 species are native of Rio Grande do Sul State. 13 This genus is well-studied and produces a variety of compounds of different structural types. Terpenoids, 20 Schinus (Anacardiaceae) contains approximately 600 species typical of tropical and subtropical regions. 21 Schinus spp. are related to contact dermatitis, although only some species contain alkenyl catechols, metabolites with potential allergenic properties. 22 Schinus polygamus is a thorny bush or a small tree native from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Peru. Alpha-phellandrene and limonene are the major components of its essential oil, which is reported to present antimicrobial activity. The hexane and methanol extracts of S. polygamus contain β-sitosterol, quercetin and related compounds, which were associated to analgesic, antiinflammatory and anti-thermal activities. 23,24 Baccharis spicata and S. polygamus are hosts of galling psyllids (Hemiptera, Psyllidae). In B. spicata, as the inductor (an unidentified species of Baccharopelma) attacks leaves; they are folded upward alongside the midrib and the edges of the upper portion approaching each other, forming a longitudinal slit 26 These small conical galls were found dispersed on the leaf blade, which maintains portions of healthy tissue (Figure1). Both species are native of Brazil and belong to plant genera which present volatile organic compounds (VOC) 18,24 that can act as mediators in the interactions between these plant species and some associated herbivores. Headspace solid-phase micro extraction (HS-SPME) has been already employed in the study of fresh plant volatile compounds, as it presents some advantages over other sampling techniques. It is a solvent-free and sensitive technique, in which extraction and concentration are performed in a single step. Moreover, it provides information on the plant composition which is supposed to be closer to the one in vivo. Experimental Leaves and galls of Schinus polygamus and Baccharis spicata were colleted in Porto Alegre City, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Six plants of Baccharis spicata were employed and in the case of Schinus polygamus, only one plant was sampled, as this species is not of widespread occurrence and is usually present as isolated individuals. The samples were identified by a local botanist and voucher specimens of S. polygamus (148777) and B. spicata (148798) have been deposited in the herbarium of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (ICN). The SPME fiber (DVB-CAR-PDMS 50/30 metal) was provided by Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA). Prior to use, the fiber was conditioned according to the supplier specifications. All the n-alcanes were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, USA) and Na 2 HPO 4 / KH 2 PO 4 (sodium phosphate dibasic and potassium dihydrogenphosphate) from Synth (São Paulo, Brazil). Changes in the Volatile Organic Profile of Schinus polygamus (Anacardiaceae) J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 558 SPME coating was used for volatile compounds extraction of 0.5 g of leaves ( Linear temperature programmed retention indices (LTPRI) were determined employing retention data of three n-alkanes solutions (C9 to C12, C13 to C16 and C17 to C20), along with retention data of volatile compounds of B. spicata and S. polygamus samples. 500 mL of 1\% methanolic solutions of C9 to C12 and C13 to C16 n-alkanes were diluted to 2 mL of water. The same procedure was adopted to prepare the solution of the n-paraffins C17 to C20, except the last one when 1000 mL was diluted to 2 mL. Headspace extraction was carried out at 30 ºC during 5 min for the solution of higher molecular weight paraffins and during 1 min for the two other solutions. Desorption procedure in the injector port was the same described for leaves and galls samples. A Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph 17A coupled to a Mass Spectrometer Detector QP 5050A (GC/MSD) was employed to perform chromatographic analyses. Capillary column was used under the following conditions: OV-5 (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm) with initial oven temperature of 60 ºC rising at 3 ºC min -1 until final temperature of 250 ºC. Injector and detector temperature were kept at 250 ºC, while helium flow rate was 1.0 mL min -1 and desorptions were made in the splitless mode. All the components were tentatively identified through comparison of their LTPRI with those registered in the literature databases. 29 Experimental mass spectra were also compared with the ones stored in MS databases (6 th edition of the Wiley library). Relative percentage of each component was obtained directly from chromatographic peak areas, considering the sum of all eluted peaks as a hundred percent. All the extractions and chromatographic analyses were performed in the same period of time, using the same chromatographic and tuning parameters of the mass spectrometer detector to prevent variations due to different detector conditions. Results and Discussion Comparison of volatile profiles in this paper is reported as qualitative differences or changing concentrations, reflecting relative amounts (chromatographic area counts) and not absolute quantities. This is due to the nature of the extraction process employed, considering several equilibria, such as between volatile compounds of small pieces of vegetable tissue and headspace, and between headspace and fiber coating. It is important to point out that even though, in this specific case, HS-SPME may not result in the measure of absolute amounts of volatile compounds, it presents the advantage of measuring the changes in volatile profile of living tissues, which is a difficult goal to reach with other extraction techniques. Profound changes were found in the composition of healthy and galled leaves of S. polygamus 31 Plant species commonly produce a great variety of volatiles after herbivore damage, and has been demonstrated that these substances can act as indirect or direct plant defenses. 32 Considering the results of this work, a valid hypothesis is that psyllid galls will have an impact over S. polygamus and B. spicata, changing their signaling ability. Linear hydrocarbons n-heptane and n-nonane were the major components Among all volatile terpenoids present in galls of both species, a-pinene stands out as one of the major compounds of S. polygamus galls. This monoterpene presents allelopathic properties 33 and may act as ovipositional signaling for herbivore insects. One example of its stimulant activity was reported for the oviposition of Dioryctria amatella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). a-Pinene metabolites produced by Ips pini (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) play a role in the complex population control of this beetle, as they act as repellents of other males of the same species. In general, regarding B. spicata, a higher amount of VOC was found in the headspace of galled leaves (33 compounds). The major ones were: monoterpenes β-pinene (40.9\%) and limonene (19.1\%), while healthy leaves provided 25 compounds, presenting 1-undecene (17.8\%), limonene (15.3\%), β-pinene (13.5\%), (E)-caryophyllene (12.8\%) and g-muurolene (11.4\%) as the major ones, according to Likewise S. polygamus, terpenoid compounds presented higher concentrations in the headspace of the tissue attacked by the gallmaker (96 ± 1.1 for galls and 68 ± 8.2 for healthy leaves), and this phenomenon can be observed in a-Terpineol is a trace volatile compound found only in the headspace of B. spicata galls. In spite of its low concentration this compound can act as a barrier against herbivores that would attack gall tissues. Lee and Changes in the Volatile Organic Profile of Schinus polygamus (Anacardiaceae) J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 560 coworkers a-cis-Bergamotene is a trace volatile detected only in S. polygamus galls. This compound can protect gall tissues against herbivores because it possibly acts as an attractant for predators. This action of a-cis-bergamotene was observed in specimens of Nicotiana attenuate (Solanaceae) attacked by Manduca quinquemaculata (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae). The oral secretion of this insect can stimulate the production of small amounts of a-cis-bergamotene, which attracts predator insects. This stimulus is similar to the one promoted by methyl jasmonate. 36 Among all volatile terpenoids present in galls of both species, a-pinene stands out as one of the major compounds of S. polygamus galls. This monoterpene presents allelopathic properties 33 and may act as ovipositional signaling for herbivore insects. One example of its stimulant activity was reported for the oviposition of Dioryctria amatella (Lepidorptera: Pyralidae). a-Pinene metabolites produced by Ips pini (Coleóptera: Scolytidae) play a role in the complex population control of this beetle, as they act as repellents of other males of the same species. 6 Although the role of monoterpenes as reproductive signals to galling psyllid is not yet known, data presented in this work may give a clue about this issue regarding gall induction in S. polygamus and B. spicata. Myrcene was another monoterpene detected in S. polygamus only in the galls headspace. In B. spicata, its presence was observed in the headspace of galls and healthy leaves, although its concentration was higher for gall tissue (from 2.2\% ± 0.4 to 6.6\% ± 0.8). Some previous works showed that monoterpenes probably act as effective barriers against free living herbivore insects. As an example, food enriched with a mixture of a-pinene, β-pinene, limonene and myrcene can reduce the digestive efficiency of Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). 38 A variation in concentration of green leaf volatiles (GLV) was found in both species B. spicata and S. polygamus. As an example, a lower amount of cis-3-hexenyl acetate was detected in the galls headspace of S. polygamus when compared to healthy leaves 39 cis-3-Hexenyl acetate can act as an attractant to parasitoids that attack herbivore insects. Therefore, a reasonable hypothesis for changes in the volatile profile of S. polygamus and B. spicata is that it increases the defenses of these plant species. In fact, during this study, no free living insect was found eating the leaves of these species and the only signal of herbivory found was restricted to the galls. It must be notice that S. polygamus showed several phytosanitary problems (herbivore and pathogens attack) during the period of absence of foliar galls. Also, headspace of healthy leaves of S. polygamus showed a very poor volatile profile with low amounts of monoterpenes and high amounts of paraffinic hydrocarbons. Analytical methods commonly employed for the study of volatile compounds in plants, such as distillation and dynamic headspace would be difficult to apply in this type of investigation, because they either employ harsh experimental conditions for living plants or time consuming and cumbersome procedures. Conclusions Profound changes were observed in the volatile profile of the headspace of leaves of Schinus polygamus and Baccharis spicata as they underwent the attack of galling psyllids. These changes were mainly related to higher production of volatile terpenes in the galled tissues of both species. Also, an increase in the amounts of green volatiles in the vicinity of galls of S. polygamus was observed. These chemical changes seem to be linked to the signaling mechanisms of these plant gall models and can provide clues for a better understanding of this complex kind of insect-plant interaction. HS-SPME proved to be an important and unique analytical tool to this specific application because it provided a fast and easy analytical method to access the volatiles profile of minor amounts of living leaves and galls of both investigated species.},

	abstract = {A cognição animal pode ser definida como a capacidade apresentada por um organismo em adquirir, reter e posteriormente utilizar a informação sensorial na tomada de decisões, em diferentes contextos. A compreensão de como os sinais emitidos no ambiente interagem com os canais sensoriais dos animais capazes de percebê-los ajuda a desvendar o significado ecológico e evolutivo das interações entre os organismos. No contexto da polinização, a atração de visitantes à flor é atribuída a uma grande diversidade de sinais, principalmente os visuais e olfativos. Além de atuarem como atrativos, esses sinais também podem exibir funções relacionadas à comunicação da presença/ausência de recursos. Não obstante, outras modalidades sensoriais menos conhecidas, também desempenham papel relevante na interação entre flores e visitantes. A ideia central do presente trabalho é expor, através de exemplos relevantes da literatura, os principais sinais emitidos pelas flores e percebidos pelas abelhas, seja através do uso de uma única modalidade sensorial ou através de múltiplas modalidades. Independente da modalidade sensorial e da complexidade dos estímulos, estudos sobre as interações entre plantas e seus visitantes florais ganham maior entendimento das relações se consideramos os diferentes aspectos relacionados com o sinal que está sendo emitido, e a direcionalidade do mesmo, ou simplesmente a capacidade ou não de ser percebido. Quantificar os processos, suas causas e consequências reforça o entendimento de padrões evolutivos, ecológicos e comportamentais entre os organismos interagentes, tanto em relações puramente mutualistas quanto em relações antagonistas. HOW DO BEES PERCEIVE FLOWERS AND WHY IT IS IMPORTANT? Animal cognition can be defined as the ability of an organism to acquire, retain and subsequently use the sensory information during decision-making processes in different contexts. The understanding of how the signals emitted in the environment interact with the sensory system of animals capable of perceiving them helps to unravel the ecological and evolutionary significance of the interactions between organisms. In the context of pollination, the attraction of visitors to the flower is attributed to a great diversity of signals, especially visuals and olfactory. In addition to acting as attractants, they can also exhibit functions related to the communication of the presence/absence of resources. Nevertheless, other sensory modalities, also play a relevant role on the interaction between flowers and visitors. The central idea of the present study is to present, through relevant examples from the literature, the main signals emitted by the flowers and perceived by the bees, either by a single sensory modality or through multiple modalities. Regardless of the sensory modality and the complexity of the stimuli, studies of the interactions between plants and their floral visitors can be better understood and detailed if we consider the different aspects related to the signal being emitted and the directionality of the same, or simply the capacity or not to be perceived. Quantifying processes, their causes and consequences reinforce the understanding of evolutionary, ecological and behavioral patterns among interacting organisms, both in mutualistic and antagonistic relationships.},

The whole volatile blends that make up the olfactory environment of maize field biotope was identified according to the ECB oviposition behaviour (Paper I). Secondly taking into account the diel periodicity of ECB behaviour we studied the diel changes of volatile profiles released from maize plant and from maize field (Paper II). Thirdly, we studied the process of host fidelity within the ECB host plants. The volatiles released from different host plants at the time of ECB oviposition flight were identified and the oviposition behaviour was studied in wind tunnel to evidence the host plant preferences of ovipositing females (Paper III). Fourthly, we address the question on assortative mating in ECB pherotypes and we investigated the chemical signals involved in the reproductive isolation in ECB pherotypes.

	abstract = {Vector-borne viruses can manipulate the expression of symptoms in host plants to increase the likelihood of being carried to a new healthy host. Virus transmission can occur through three mechanisms, depending on the time they persist within the vector: persistent (PT), semi-persistent (SPT) or non-persistent (NP). The transmission mechanism implies differences in the time it takes for the virus to enter, and its capability to invade and replicate inside the vector. Therefore, often, viruses modulate vector manipulation as a function the transmission mechanism. Predictions associated with vector manipulation by SPT viruses assume that their strategy should be an intermediate point between PT and NP. However, several studies have shown that their complexity goes beyond being an intermediate point, and that these viruses may share characteristics of PT and NP viruses, according to certain traits associated with the particular system. Potato Yellow Vein Virus (PYVV) is classified as a SPT and the causal agent of potato yellow vein disease (PYVD), a re-emerging disease of potato crops in northern South America. Infection with PYVV, which may be asymptomatic, is transmitted vertically through infected seed tubers or horizontally by the Greenhouse Whitefly (GWF) Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). The symptoms of PYVD in native potato plants show a primary and a secondary development. The symptoms of primary development occur through a chlorosis of the secondary and tertiary veins of the leaves of the upper third of potato plants. Usually, these symptoms occur at the edge of the leaves and it spreads to the inside, always more noticeable on the underside of the leaves. The time in which GWF adults are infectious can range from days to weeks, making the reduction of vector populations through chemical treatments generally ineffective in controlling epidemics. Likewise, understanding the role of the effects that viruses cause in plants on the ecology of insect vectors can be useful in comparing the key adaptations associated with modes of transmission that do not involve vectors (ie, vertical transmission or mechanical transmission). This study focuses on understanding the effect of symptom expression as a strategy for SPT viruses to transmit and remain in the environment to infect new hosts; as well as to examine some of the abiotic factors that may induce symptom expression in the host plants. Finally, this work aims to provide useful knowledge that allows the development of more sustainable agronomic management strategies. In order to evaluate the effect of the expression of symptoms of PYVD in potato plants on the survival, development and behavior of its GWF vector, experiments were carried out under controlled conditions in climatic chambers. Survival of immature stages, average time of emergence of adults, and preference and settlement of insects fed on virus-free, and infected asymptomatic and symptomatic plants were evaluated and compared. The expression of symptoms and the relative quantification of the virus in potato plants growing under different temperature and water deficit conditions. We found that survival of GWF was affected when insects feed from infected plants instead free-virus plants but not between symptomatic or asymptomatic plants. Regarding the development of GWF, it was evident that the mean emergence time of adults was longer in symptomatic, infected plants than in healthy plants, but it was even longer in asymptomatic, infected plants. The behavior of the GWF adults changed depending on their previous diet. I found that, when GWF did not have any contact with PYVV prior to the experiment, they preferred to select symptomatic infected plants foe feeding rather than asymptomatic or virus-free plants. However, when GWF was pre-fed with potato plants infected with PYVV, they preferred healthy plants. On the other hand, I found that temperature does not have a significant effect on symptom expression, at least at the temperature range I evaluated. However, in those plants in which there was a drought stress, symptoms were evident three days after watering, regardless of the temperature. Well-watered plants had delayed symptom expression, which occurred 10 to 25 days after plants under drought stress. In conclusion, symptom expression of PYVV in potato plants has a direct effect on both the physiology and behavior of its GWF vector and can be triggered by water stress. This study shows that SPT viruses share characteristics with TP and NP viruses. Also show that vector feeding experience influences their choice and settlement on new hosts, as well as the fact that a prolonged period of drought allows that plants are more susceptible to expressing symptoms and attracting new vectors. These factors can be considered when establishing new practices for managing and prevent future PYVV epidemics. ; Los virus transmitidos por vectores pueden manipular la expresión de síntomas en las plantas hospederas para incrementar la probabilidad de ser llevados a un nuevo hospedero sano. Los mecanismos de trasmisión de estos virus se clasifican en tres categorías, de acuerdo con el tiempo de persistencia de los virus en los vectores: persistente (TP), semi persistente (TSP) y no persistente (NP). El mecanismo de transmisión implica diferencias en el tiempo que el virus es infectivo dentro del insecto vector, y su capacidad de invadir y replicarse dentro del vector (acá se hablaría de si es dentro del vector es propagativo o circulativo). Por este motivo, con frecuencia, los virus modulan la manipulación que ejercen sobre sus hospederos en función de la modalidad de trasmisión. Las predicciones relacionadas con la manipulación de los vectores de virus con mecanismo TSP asumen que su estrategia debe ser un punto intermedio entre los virus con TP y NP. Sin embargo, en diversos estudios se ha evidenciado que su complejidad va más allá de ser un punto intermedio y que en realidad pueden compartir características de los virus TP y NP, de acuerdo con ciertos rasgos particulares del sistema. El Potato Yellow Vein Virus (PYVV) es un virus transmitido de forma semipersistente (TSP) y es el agente causal de la enfermedad del amarillamiento de las nervaduras de la hoja de papa (PYVD del inglés Potato Yellow Vein Disease), una enfermedad reemergente de los cultivos de papa en el norte de América del Sur. La infección por el PYVV, que puede ser asintomática, se transmite verticalmente a través de los tubérculos de semillas infectados u horizontalmente por la mosca blanca de los invernaderos (MBI) Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). Los síntomas de la enfermedad en plantas de papa presentan un desarrollo primario y uno secundario. Los síntomas de desarrollo primario se dan mediante una clorosis de las nervaduras secundarias y terciarias de las hojas del tercio superior de las plantas de papa. Usualmente, estos síntomas se dan en el borde de las hojas y que se va extendiendo hasta el interior, siendo más severo l envés de los foliolos. El tiempo en el que los adultos de la MBI son infectivos después de adquirir el virus puede ser desde días a semanas, haciendo que la reducción de poblaciones de los vectores mediante tratamientos químicos sea generalmente ineficaz para controlar las epidemias de PYVV. Así mismo, la comprensión del rol de los efectos de los virus en las plantas sobre la ecología de los insectos vectores puede ser útil para comparar y contrastar las adaptaciones clave asociadas a modalidades de trasmisión que no impliquen vectores (i.e., trasmisión vertical o trasmisión mecánica). Este estudio tiene como objetivo comprender el efecto que tiene la expresión de los síntomas como estrategia de los virus tipo TSP para ; Corporación Colombiana de Investigación Agropecuaria (Agrosavia), Universidad Nacional de Colombia ; Magíster en Ciencias - Microbiología .

	abstract = {Leaf-mining insects are an herbivore group whose larvae live and feed inside plant leaves. Leaf mines are distinct marks on leaves and can provide much information on insect-plant relationships. Most leaf miners are monophagous or oligophagous. Therefore ecologists and paleontologists use them to study interactions and coevolution among plants, insects and natural enemies. There are many different types of leaf-mining patterns on plant leaves, which may have different impacts on host plants. Compared with ectophagous herbivores, leaf-mining insects should have unique influences on host plant characteristics, such as leaf morphology, leaf chemistry, plant physiology, plant growth and production. Obvious impacts include leaf asymmetry, callus formation, photosynthesis, and green islands. Types and degrees of such influences are varied for different leaf miner species or different host plant species. In turn, the change of plant features may have positive or negative impacts on oviposition and feeding of leaf-mining insects. Studies on plant responses to leaf-mining and the defensive mechanisms of plants are helpful in understanding the coevolution between leaf miners and their food plants. ; Los insectos minadores de hojas son un grupo de herbívoros cuyas larvas viven y se alimentan del interior de las hojas. Lo que denominamos minas son las diferentes marcas que quedan en las hojas y que pueden proporcionar valiosa información acerca de las relaciones planta-insecto. La mayoría de minadores son monófagos u oligófagos. Los ecólogos y paleontólogos los usan para estudiar las interacciones y la coevolución entre plantas, insectos y sus enemigos naturales. Existen numerosos tipos de patrones de minas en las hojas, que pueden producir diferentes impactos en la planta hospedadora. Si los comparamos con los insectos ectófagos, los minadores de hojas pueden tener una influencia muy característica en numerosos aspectos de la planta hospedadora, como por ejemplo la morfología y la química foliar, la fisiología de la planta y su crecimiento y producción. Entre los impactos más evidentes, podemos nombrar asimetría foliar, formación de callos, fotosíntesis e «islas verdes». La tipología y el gravedad de estos impactos varían según en tipo de insecto minador y de planta hospedadora. Además, los cambios funcionales que se producen en la planta hospedadora pueden a su vez tener efectos positivos o negativos en la oviposición y la alimentación de los minadores. El estudio de los mecanismos de defensa de la planta hospedadora para combatir a los minadores puede resultar de gran utilidad para entender la coevolución entre ambos organismos.},

	abstract = {El presente estudio es uno de los primeros trabajos realizados en Colombia que produce información relevante sobre la ecología y la evolución del perforador del fruto de las solanáceas Neoleucinodes elegantalis (Guenée) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). Se consideraron cuatro puntos importantes: la filogenia del género Neoleucinodes, el aislamiento reproductivo entre razas de N. elegantalis, la estructura genética de las poblaciones de N. elegantalis en Centro y Suramérica y la evaluación del poder atrayente de su feromona sexual en la naturaleza. En cuanto a la filogenia morfológica se ha hipotetizado que N. elegantalis y otras especies Suramericanas: N. imperialis, N. prophetica, N. torvis, N. silvaniae, Neoleucinodes n sp.1 (Ecuador) junto con especies de dos géneros cercanos: Leucinodes orbonalis, distribuido en Asia y África y Euleucinodes conifrons colectado en Colombia, conforman un mismo grupo natural. La no inclusión de E. conifrons y L. orbonalis en un mismo género junto con las especies de Neoleucinodes haría de éste un grupo parafilético. Se visualizaron algunos agrupamientos coincidentes con la filogenia de las solanáceas hospederas. Los resultados muestran que N. elegantalis es una plaga invasiva por su carácter euroico, su amplia distribución geográfica y su extensa relación evolutiva con sus plantas hospederas. Las hembras de N. elegantalis fueron monógamas o monoándricas y mostraron una tendencia hacia el apareamiento asociativo (aislamiento precigótico tipo comportamental) debido a que fueron más frecuentes los cruces homotípicos en comparación con los cruces heterotípicos cuando se cruzaron poblaciones de N. elegantalis de Solanum lycopersicum (S.l), S. quitoense (S.q) y S. betaceum (S.b). La progenie se desarrolló hasta el estado adulto del insecto en el cruce homotípico (♀S.q x ♂S.q) y en el cruce heterotípico (♀ S.q x ♂ S.b) y su línea recíproca (♀ S.b x ♂ S.q. Sin embargo, la progenie no fue viable en el cruce (♀ S.q x ♂ S.l) y su línea recíproca (♀ S.l x ♂ S.q) por cuanto, el insecto solo se desarrolló hasta el estado de larva neonata (posible caso de aislamiento postcigótico). La asociación a la planta hospedera y el gradiente ambiental pueden estar afectando la evolución de las barreras de flujo genético entre las poblaciones de N. elegantalis incrementando su aislamiento reproductivo. El análisis de la genética de poblaciones de N. elegantalis con el gen CO1, mostró que las poblaciones de Centro y Sur América se encuentran genéticamente estructuradas con valores (Fst=0.73, p0.0001). Los FST pareados muestran diferencias genéticas entre países alejados geográficamente, mostrando aislamiento por distancia. La Cordillera de los Andes separo las poblaciones genéticamente diferenciadas en Ecuador y Colombia. En Colombia, se diferenciaron cuatro haplotipos más frecuentes H1, H2, H4 y H7, dicha diferenciación fue debida a la asociación a la planta hospedera. Los haplotipos H1, H2 y H4 son aparentemente simpátricos dado que fueron encontrados en las Cordilleras Central y Oriental de Colombia. El porcentaje de divergencia de estos tres haplotipos fue 0.5\%. El más alto valor de distancia genética fue obtenido para el haplotipo H7 con 1.9\% de divergencia y se distribuye entre las Cordilleras Central y Occidental. Las poblaciones de N. elegantalis más divergentes se encontraron al Sur de Colombia en un lugar donde podría haberse originado de S. quitoense. La asociación a planta hospedera y los factores ambientales diferenciados en las zonas de vida de Holdridge juegan un papel importante en la diferenciación de N. elegantalis, probablemente la especie pudo haberse diferenciado por efecto de especiación alo-simpátrica, ya que se encontró que existe una barrera geográfica que influyo su divergencia (La Cordillera de los Andes) y a su vez se encontró asociación a planta hospedera, siendo esta última, una barrera que en simpatría sigue reforzando las barreras de aislamiento reproductivo entre las cuatro razas de esta especie . En Colombia la feromona sexual de N. elegantalis Neolegantol ® tuvo mayor poder de atracción en cultivos de S. lycopersicum; los machos de N. elegantalis de S. lycopersicum fueron más atraídos por la feromona de su propia población independientemente de su origen geográfico, dado que Neolegantol ® se obtuvo a partir de poblaciones venezolanas de N. elegantalis de S. lycopersicum. Es probable que en N. elegantalis los precursores de las feromonas sexuales que son especie específicos sean tomados de las plantas hospederas con las que se relaciona cada población del insecto. Las diferencias en el número de machos de N. elegantalis capturados por la feromona Neolegantol ® entre Colombia y Ecuador se pueden explicar por dos razones básicas: Primero, por las diferencias de adaptación local dadas por la variación en la temperatura, la altitud, la humedad, la radiación que pueden afectar bien sea a los volátiles de la planta hospedera en cada ambiente o a las señales olfativas intraespecíficas que pueden influenciar la variación en las señales de comunicación sexual dentro de las poblaciones de N. elegantalis. Segundo debido a que las poblaciones de N. elegantalis presentan aislamiento por distancia, como lo evidenciado en el análisis de genética de poblaciones de la especie en Centro y Sur América. Se espera que la composición y la concentración de la feromona sexual sean diferentes entre poblaciones de diferentes ambientes geográficos por un efecto local y por la asociación a sus diferentes plantas hospederas. En general se encontró que a pesar de que las poblaciones de N. elegantalis presenten una gran similitud morfológica, la especie divergió en cuatro razas que muy probablemente requieran diferentes maneras de manejar, por lo que los resultados obtenidos en este trabajo sugieren que más estudios son requeridos para asegurar un mejor control del insecto en campo, no solamente en Colombia sino también en otros países. ; Abstract This present study is one of the earliest work in Colombia that produce relevant information on the ecology and evolution of the solanaceous fruit borer Neoleucinodes elegantalis Solanaceae (Guenée) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). Four major points were considered: the phylogeny of the genus Neoleucinodes, reproductive isolation between N. elegantalis races; the genetic structure of populations of N. elegantalis in Central and South America; and the evaluation of the attraction power of its sexual pheromone in nature. As for the morphological phylogeny it has been hypothesized that N. elegantalis and other South American species: N. imperialis, N. prophetica, N. torvis N. silvaniae, Neoleucinodes sp. n. 1 ( Ecuador ) with two species from the closely related genus: Leucinodes orbonalis distributed in Asia and Africa and Euleucinodes conifrons collected in Colombia, composed a natural group. Failure to include E. conifrons and L. orbonalis in the same genus with species of Neoleucinodes would regard this group as paraphyletic. Some overlapping groupings with the phylogeny of host Solanaceae was visualized. The results show that N. elegantalis is an invasive pest of euroic type, because of their wide geographical distribution and extensive evolutionary relationship with their host plants. Neoleucinodes elegantalis females were monogamous or monoandric and showed a trend towards assortative mating (prezigotic behavioral isolation type) because they were more frequent homotypic crossings compared with heterotypic crosses when crossed with populations of N. elegantalis from Solanum lycopersicum (s.l.), S. quitoense (S.q) and S. betaceum (Sb). The progeny developed to the adult stage of the insect in the homotypic cross (♀S.q x ♂S.q) and heterotypic cross (♀ S.q x ♂ S.b) and their mutual line (♀ S.b x ♂ S.q). However, the progeny was not viable in the cross (♀S.q x ♂S.l) and their mutual line (♀S.l x ♂S.q) because the insect only developed to the state of neonate larva (a possible case of postzigotic isolation). The association of the host plant and environmental gradient may be affecting the evolution of the barriers of gene flow between populations of N. elegantalis increasing their reproductive isolation. The analysis of population genetics of N. elegantalis with CO1 gene, showed that the populations of Central and South America are genetically structured (Fst = 0.73, p 0.0001). The paired FST showed genetic differences between geographically distant countries, showing isolation by distance. The Andes separated genetically distinct populations in Ecuador and Colombia. In Colombia, the four most common haplotypes are H1, H2, H4 and H7, which differences were associated to their host plants. H1, H2 and H4 haplotypes are apparently sympatric since they were found in the Central and Eastern Cordilleras of Colombia. The percentage difference of the three haplotypes was 0.5\%. The highest genetic distance value was obtained for the haplotype H7 with 1.9\% divergence and distributed between the Western and Central Cordilleras. The most divergent populations of N. elegantalis were found in southern Colombia in a place where they could have originated from S. quitoense. The association to host plant and environmental factors in the different Holdridge life zones play an important role in the differentiation of N. elegantalis and probably distinct species may have the effect of allo- sympatric speciation, since there is a geographical barrier that influenced their divergence (the Andes) and regarding host plant association this turn out to be a barrier that when in sympatry continues to strengthen reproductive isolation barriers between the four races of this species. In Colombia the sex pheromone of N. elegantalis Neolegantol® had more power of attraction in cultures of S. lycopersicum; males of N. elegantalis from S. lycopersicum were more attracted to the pheromone of its own population regardless of their geographical origin, since Neolegantol® was obtained from populations of N. elegantalis from Venezuelan S. lycopersicum. Probably in N. elegantalis the precursors of sex pheromones that are species specific are taken from the host plants. Differences in the number of males captured by N. elegantalis Neolegantol® pheromone between Colombia and Ecuador can be explained by two basic reasons: First, because of differences in local adaptation given by the variation in temperature, altitude, humidity, and by the radiation that can affect either the host plant volatiles in each environment or olfactory cues that can influence intraspecific variation in sexual communication signals within populations of N. elegantalis. Second because populations of N. elegantalis showed isolation by distance, as evidenced in the analysis of population genetics of the species in Central and South America. It is expected that the composition and concentration of the sex pheromone are different between populations from different geographical environments by a local effect and by association to their different host plants Generally it was found that although the populations of N. elegantalis present a great morphological similarity among them, the species diverged into four races that will likely require different ways of handling, so that the results obtained in this study suggest that more studies will be required to ensure better control of the insect in the field, not only in Colombia but also abroad. ; Doctorado},

Os efeitos indiretos de um nível trófico sobre outro no ecossistema Caatinga também são relatados. A Caatinga e outras florestas secas compartilham várias características, como a prevalência do sistema de polinização biótico e a dispersão abiótica de sementes. A alta frequência de plantas com Nectários extraflorais possibilita uma ampla gama de interações entre plantas e artrópodes, mas especialmente com formigas. Porém, todas estas interações apresentam seus custos e benefícios de forma variável, tendo como a principal justificativa a sazonalidade dos fatores abióticos. A Caatinga vem passando por fragmentação em virtude de ações antrópicas e as mudanças climáticas já se mostram críticas sobre vários aspectos da ecologia deste ecossistema. Assim, a quebra ou alterações nas interações causam efeitos múltiplos em vários distintos níveis biológicos que irão repercutir desde o nível de população ao nível de ecossistemas, sendo essencial a compreensão das interações ecológicas em termos de dinâmica florestal para que só assim ocorra de forma apropriada o planejamento para restauração e melhores práticas de conservação na Caatinga. Seasonal variation of networks of plant-arthropod interactions in Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest A B S T R A C TThis article presents a broad view of the interactions between plants and arthropods in the Caatinga ecosystem, highlighting the role of climatic seasonality in the availability and quality of plant resources, as well as the effects of these factors in the production of plant chemical defenses, mutualistic interactions, and antagonistic interactions as herbivory. The indirect effects of one trophic level on another in the Caatinga ecosystem are also reported.The Caatinga and other dry forests share several characteristics, such as the prevalence of the biotic pollination system and the abiotic dispersion of seeds. The high frequency of plants with extrafloral Nectaries allows a wide range of interactions between plants and arthropods, but especially with ants. However, all these interactions present their costs and benefits in a variable way, with the main justification for the seasonality of abiotic factors. The Caatinga has been undergoing fragmentation due to anthropic actions and climate change is already showing criticism about various aspects of the ecology of this ecosystem. Thus, the breakdown or changes in the interactions cause multiple effects at several different biological levels that will have repercussions from the population level to the level of ecosystems, being essential the understanding of the ecological interactions in terms of forest dynamics so that only this way occurs properly. planning for restoration and best conservation practices in the Caatinga.Keywords: Caatinga, pollination, Herbivory, predation, abiotic factor},

	abstract = {Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) mediate a wide variety of interactions in ecosystems. However, many volatile compounds are found across plant taxa, and some are exploited to attract natural enemies for biological control. Subtle changes in HIPV blends can produce profound changes in the behavior of predators, parasitoids and herbivores, and may also alter the defensive processes of neighboring plants. I investigated different ecological and evolutionary factors to understand how plant volatile emissions are affected by feeding guild, herbivore diet breadth and domestication. I meta-analyzed 109 studies and found that specialists induce more total volatiles than generalists. Domesticated species have stronger green-leaf volatile induction that wild plants. Chewers induce more volatiles than sap-feeders in most biochemical classes except benzenoids/phenylpropanoids. Particularly, sap-feeders induce more methyl salicylate (MeSA) than chewers. MeSA is of particular interest because it is used commercially as a predator lure; it is the volatile analog of the phytohormone salicylic acid, and provokes strong responses in natural enemies. However, I hypothesized that exposure to MeSA may have unintended consequences on plant defensive pathways. In a field experiment, I investigated interactive effects of MeSA exposure and herbivory on proteins associated with plant defense, herbivore performance, and pathogen resistance. I found that MeSA increased plant resistance to a chewing herbivore, Manduca sexta, and improved resistance to secondary pathogen infection by 25\%. This common volatile signal, which is often emitted in response to sap-feeding and other salicylic acid-associated attacks, may not compromise resistance to chewing herbivores due to tradeoffs in guild-specific expression of defensive compounds, and may also buffer against opportunistic pathogens.},

Wilczek), are important crops for nutrition, employment and income generation, and essential products in the diet of the Colombian population. A limitation of the cultivation of legumes in Colombia is represented by the presence of pests and diseases, especially those of fungal origin such as anthracnose. Traditionally, the control of this disease has been carried out through the application of synthetic biocidal substances, which have adverse effects on human health and the environment. In addition, varietal resistance has been used; Unfortunately, this approach presents difficulties in detecting resistant materials quickly and reliably for plant breeding programs, and resistance is not long-lasting. Therefore, new alternatives are required to control the disease, but from a non-biocidal approach, and ecologically safer. A novel alternative to the use of current fungicides is the possibility of stimulating the innate chemical defenses of plants, through the use of chemical elicitors (chemical substances that activate the defense mechanisms of the plant; such as methyl jasmonate, coronatin, salicylic acid and acetylsalicylic acid). ; Las leguminosas, como el frijol común (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) y el frijol mungo (Vigna radiata L., ‎R.Wilczek), son cultivos importantes a nivel nutricional, generación de empleo e ingresos, y productos esenciales en la dieta de la población colombiana. Una limitante del cultivo de leguminosas en Colombia lo representa la presencia de plagas y enfermedades, especialmente aquellas de origen fúngico como la antracnosis. Tradicionalmente el control de esta enfermedad se ha realizado mediante la aplicación de sustancias sintéticas biocidas, que presentan efectos adversos para la salud humana y el medio ambiente. Además, se ha empleado resistencia varietal; lamentablemente esta aproximación presenta dificultades para detectar materiales resistentes rápidamente y de manera confiable para los programas de fitomejoramiento, además que la resistencia no es duradera. Por lo anterior, se requieren nuevas alternativas que permitan controlar la enfermedad, pero desde un enfoque no biocida, y ecológicamente más seguro. Una alternativa novedosa al uso de los fungicidas actuales es la posibilidad de estimular las defensas químicas innatas de las plantas, mediante el uso de elicitores químicos (sustancias químicas que activan los mecanismos de defensa de la planta; tales como metil jasmonato, coronatina, ácido salicílico y ácido acetilsalicílico). Estas defensas químicas incluyen mecanismos complejos y sofisticados como la producción de metabolitos secundarios antimicrobianos constitutivos o inducidos, denominados respectivamente fitoanticipinas y fitoalexinas, y la activación de enzimas potentes relacionadas con la defensa, como la fenilalanina amonio liasa (PAL) y enzimas hidrolíticas, como quitinasas y β-1,3-glucanasas, que evitan el establecimiento del patógeno. En la presente tesis se prepararon derivados del ácido 1-oxo-4-indanoilcarboxílico relacionados estructuralmente con la coronatina, los cuales se purificaron por técnicas cromatográficas y se identificaron por métodos espectroscópicos. Soluciones hidro-alcoholicas de estos compuestos se aplicaron sobre plántulas de variedades de fríjol común con diferente comportamiento fitopatológico (cultivares Andino, Calima e ICA-Bachué, entre otros) y frijol mungo. Como controles positivos se emplearon soluciones de los elicitores reconocidos metiljasmonato, ácido salicílico, y ácido acetilsalicílico. Posteriormente se analizó por cromatografía líquida de alta eficiencia (CLAE-DAD) la producción de nueve fitoanticipinas y/o fitoalexinas (dalbergioidina, 2’-hidroxigenisteina, daidzeina, genisteina, coumestrol, phaseollidina, kievitona, phaseollinisoflavano, y phaseollina) previamente aisladas por técnicas cromatográficas e identificadas por métodos espectroscópicos (Resonancia magnética nuclear de 1H y 13C, UV, y espectrometría de masas). Además, se determinó la actividad de las enzimas PAL, quitinasa y β-1,3-glucanasa por métodos espectrofotométricos. La cuantificación de las fitoalexinas y/o fitoanticipinas y la actividad enzimática, demostraron que la composición de los extractos de frijol común y frijol mungo es dependiente de la especie y cultivar, la estructura y concentración del derivado indanoilo (elicitor potencial), y el tiempo post-inducción. Adicionalmente se encontró que el compuesto 1-oxo-4-indanoil L-isoleucina metil ester presentó un efecto inductor de fitoalexinas comparable al de los elicitores reconocidos metil jasmonato y ácido salicílico. Los resultados de la presente tesis aportan información valiosa para los programas de fitomejoramiento en frijol y el diseño de nuevos elicitores de defensas químicas, para el agro colombiano. 8Texto tomado de la fuente) ; Maestría ; Magister en Ciencias Químicas ; Química de los Productos Naturales y los Alimentos (QUIPRONAL)},

	abstract = {Plants are able to store and emit a wide array of volatile organic compounds, also known as VOCs, which play a pivotal role in their interaction with the ecosystems. These VOCs, released as a mixture of lipophilic compounds with low molecular weight, are produced by different biosynthetic pathways and actively participate in plant defensive strategies against both abiotic and biotic stress factors. Among them, plant-plant interaction, the attraction of pollinators and/or parasitoids and the signaling between symbiont organisms, are the most documented. The development of techniques aimed in trapping, analyze, identify, and quantify plant volatiles, coupled to the evolution of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analytical methods, as well as the possibility to monitor in-vivo the changes in VOCs production, has significantly increased our knowledge concerning VOCs biosynthesis and their ecological role. This chapter will introduce an overview concerning the ecological role of plant volatiles as well as the biosynthetic pathways involved in their production. Moreover, it will describe the materials as well as the analytical steps that should be followed for static headspace VOCs analysis through solid-phase microextraction (SPME), which is one of the most common, repeatable and accepted technique.},

	abstract = {Parasitoids find chemical volatiles produced by herbivore-damaged plants attractive. It has been suggested that by manipulating these volatiles in crop plants, biological control can be enhanced in agricultural systems. Before this technology is implemented, it is important to understand the dynamics of the system. I used two different modeling approaches to address this phenomenon. In the first model, I combined a modified predator-prey functional response equation with an age-structured herbivore population model. In the second model I took a spatially-explicit stochastic simulation approach and examined the Brassica oleraceae, Pieris rapae, and Cotesia rubecula system in more detail. I looked at the effects of plant induction delay, plant relaxation delay, herbivore density, and parasitoid host-age preference. In both models, parasitoids gained the most from signals when all herbivore instars were viable hosts, herbivore density was low, and relaxation delays were short. In the stochastic simulation model, shorter induction delays could lead to considerable gains for the parasitoids. Together, the models indicate that there are some conditions that favor parasitoids following herbivore-induced plant volatiles. By creating plants that produce signals in the right time frame, it may be possible to optimize biological control. However, it is also apparent from my models that herbivore-induced volatiles are ineffective during herbivore outbreaks because parasitoids are limited by factors other the time it takes to find hosts, which is the primary way herbivore-induced plant volatiles aid foraging parasitoids. Improving biological control is one of the practices growers can adopt as part of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), and in the final section of this dissertation I discussed a survey exploring how growers adopt IPM. I found that practices consistent with IPM were adopted in a piecemeal fashion by cotton growers in Eastern North Carolina. My analysis indicated that growers did not see all these practices as part of a single management decision, but rather as parts of independent decisions dealing with weed management, insect management, crop management, and ecosystem management.},

	abstract = {Management of the leafhopper Hauptidia maroccanais inadequate. Despite not being a regular pest in glasshouses, H.maroccanais capable of significant damage. Current conrol methods rely on one chemical agent(Indoxacarb) and a putative predator. In the face of widespread chemical resistance and unreliability of generalist predators, the risk to growers under these conditions is increased. Part of the problem facing growers is that only very basic information about this pest is known, with few studies on the ecological interactions that will be vital for suffifcient control. It is these knowledge gaps that this thesis addresses. A summary literature review introduces the main topics of study and examines the failure of a previously attempted biological control agent. Chapter 2 builds on evidence from similar species and looks at improving trapping of the pest in glasshouses. Non-yellow traps are tested for efficacy and selectivity under laboratory conditions, and indicate that there is scope for improvement in this area. The visual ecology of this pest is examined again in Chapter 4 where the use of LED technology to increase the visual signal of traps is examined. The results of which again indicate that there is more complexity to the visual cues evaluated by H.maroccanathan the consensus implies. The importance of plant volatiles to herbivores is well studied. For H.maroccanahowever, much is not known. Of particular importance is the ability of this pest to detect and respond to the volatile blends released by plants under attack by conspecifics. Growers have reported that H.maroccanaforms hotspots within crops. Whether this is due to aggregation or a lack of migration is unknown. Information from experiments here suggests that it is largely due to lack of emigration rather than aggregative behaviours. The use of the generalist predator Macrolophuscaliginosus for control of leafhopper is critically examined and tested under laboratory conditions. The overall picture is mixed with predation of leafhopper nymphs approaching levels of consumption seen for other pests, but predation on adults being almost zero. Furthermore, the response of Macrolophusto plant volatiles from infested plants was mixed, which may indicate that under a more complex environment, the ability of this predator to locate H.maroccanais reduced.

Contrary to what was expected according to the concept of dietary specialization and infochemical use (Vet and Dicke, 1992), parasitoids of herbivores that feed on a reduced diversity of plants do not respond more innately to HIPV than more generalist parasitoids. However, parasitoids of adult herbivores tend to respond less innately than larval or pupal parasitoids. According to response specificity, as was predicted by Vet and Dicke (1992), parasitoids with a broad host range tends to respond less specifically to HIPV than do specialist parasitoids.},

	abstract = {[EN] The ability of zoophytophagous predators to produce defensive plant responses due to their phytophagous behavior has been recently demonstrated. In the case of tomatoes, the mirids Nesidiocoris tenuis and Macrolophus pygmaeus are able to attract or repel pests and/or natural enemies in different ways. Nevertheless, the herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) released by the phytophagy of both mirids, which are responsible for these behaviors, are unknown. In this work, the HIPVs produced by the plant feeding of N. tenuis and M. pygmaeus were characterized. In addition, the role of each HIPV in the repellence or attraction of two tomato pests, Bemisia tabaci and Tuta absoluta, and of the natural enemy Encarsia formosa was evaluated. Six green leaf volatiles (GLVs) plus methyl salicylate and octyl acetate clearly stood out as major differential peaks on the chromatogram in a directed analysis. The six GLV and methyl salicylate were repellent for B. tabaci and attractive to E. formosa, whereas they showed no effect on T. absoluta. Octyl acetate, which was significantly present only in the M. pygmaeus-punctured plants, was significantly attractive to T. absoluta, repellent to E. formosa and indifferent to B. tabaci. Unlike the remaining HIPVs, octyl acetate was emitted directly by M. pygmaeus and not by the plant. Our results showed that mirid herbivory could modulate the pest and natural plant enemy locations, since tomato plants release a blend of volatiles in response to this activity. These results could serve as a basis for future development of plant protection. ; The research leading to these results was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (AGL2014-55616-C3).

	abstract = {Flowering plants employ a wide variety of signals, including scent, to attract pollinators. The aim of this work was to examine whether flower volatiles in four closely related Crocus species are linked to species divergence and to the current knowledge on their pollination syndromes. Fragrances of freshly opened flowers in Crocus etruscus, C. ilvensis, C. neglectus, and C. vernus, all belonging to ser. Verni, were analyzed using GC/MS. Results coincide with present knowledge about systematic relationships among taxa. The four species fall into two main fragrance types, based on similarities of their volatile compounds. In C. etruscus, C. ilvensis, and C. neglectus, oxygenated monoterpenes (lilac aldehyde B and A) are most abundant, while C. vernus has a fragrance rich in monoterpene hydrocarbons (α-pinene and limonene). Our results point towards outcrossing mating strategies for C. etruscus, C. ilvensis, and C. neglectus, whose volatile compounds are known as pollinator attractants. This is in line with their flower architecture, showing a style of variable height, often overtopping stamens. On the other hand, a self-pollination strategy was repeatedly suggested in the literature for C. vernus, marked by flowers with the style deeply inserted in the stamens and also by a completely different flower bouquet.},

	abstract = {Thesis submitted to the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree PhD Science Johannesburg, September 2014 ; Drought has the potential to reset trophic interactions within natural and managed ecosystems. I tested how drought stress in maize and companion plants that are used in cereal agroecosystems of Kenya affect oviposition preference, larval feeding, and development of the spotted stemborer, Chilo partellus Swinhoe (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). Five host species were tested (all Poaceae): maize (Zea mays L.), Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach), signal grass [Brachiaria brizantha (A. Rich) Stapf], Brachiaria cv ‘Mulato’, and molasses grass [Melinis minutiflora (Beauv.)]. Under periods of water deficit, maize was oviposited on as much as under control unstressed maize in both choice and no-choice experiments. Similarly, larval leaf damage was not significantly different in drought-stressed and unstressed maize. However in Napier and signal grasses, oviposition occurred less on drought-stressed than on unstressed corresponding individuals of the same species. Oviposition acceptance and foliar damage remained low in both drought-stressed and unstressed molasses grass and Mulato. Larval survival and development remained high in drought-stressed maize, but not in Napier, signal, and molasses grass and Mulato, where survival and development were low in both drought-stressed and unstressed plants. Drought stress resulted in increased total plant volatile emission in Napier and signal grasses. This significant change in total volatile emission of the plants upon stress was not present in molasses grass, Mulato II, Silverleaf and Greenleaf Desmodium despite variable changes in the quantities and qualities of particular constituent compounds among all the plant species during water deficit. In wind tunnel bioassays, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from irrigated Napier and signal grasses were more attractive to C. partellus than the treatment plants. However, volatiles from molasses grass, Mulato II, Silverleaf and Greenleaf Desmodium were never preferred by the gravid moths in both irrigated and drought stressed v conditions. These changes in chemical constituents of the plant VOCs also elicited behavioural responses in parasitoids. Drought-stressed Napier grass attracted gravid Cotesia sesamiae parasitoids. Other companion plant species such as molasses grass and Mulato which constitutively emit these terpenes remained attractive to the parasitoids even under periods of drought. I attribute this differential preference of the moths to the constitutive and/or induced emission of key terpenoid compounds in plants that were tested. The induction of terpenoid compounds was coupled with a reduction in the amount of green leaf volatiles such as (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate in Napier and signal grasses. Taken together, the results suggest that control of stemborer pests using stimulo-deterrent diversion tactics remains possible under periods of environmental change.},

	abstract = {Walking through a forest, you spot a colorful butterfly larva crawling and munching on a leaf—nothing unusual, just one scene in a calm ecological play. And yet, a massive “arms race” rages between plants and their herbivores (1, 2), spurred by information and misinformation transfer. Chemical signals play the role of communicators in a channel that joins each pair of interacting partners. The mechanisms that drive coevolution of these chemically mediated webs have been an active area of research, but a satisfactory theory has yet to be established. On page 1377 of this issue, Zu et al. (3) describe a new application of information theory to coevolutionary dynamics in animal-plant networks. Many scholars have explored the role of information in ecology and evolution (4) since the 1950s, in the wake of Claude Shannon's groundbreaking theory of information and communication (5). But the actual function of information, particularly in an evolutionary context, often has been obscured by insufficient data and the lack of a proper mapping of the links between information and fitness (6). Zu et al. made use of plants' secondary metabolism (which forms metabolites not involved in plant growth or development) to couple two bipartite networks, namely the animal-plant (AP) one (i.e., who eats what) and the plant–volatile organic compounds (PV) one [i.e., what volatile organic compounds (VOCs) plants generate]. The authors gathered data from a tropical dry forest; insect larvae were collected from leaves, and trophic interactions were confirmed in the laboratory. The VOC repertoire was retrieved from leaves in the field with a method that characterizes the chemical profile around each leaf. ; R.S. is supported by the Generalitat de Catalunya and the Santa Fe Institute.},

	url = {http://pqdtopen.proquest.com/#viewpdf?dispub=3462163},
	abstract = {Insect-plant symbioses are ubiquitous and widespread, and include many examples of mutualism. Obligate ant-plant mutualisms are a common feature of the tropics and a classic example of mutualism. Ant-mutualists protect the plants against herbivory, and plants provide housing and food rewards for the ants. In ant-plant mutualisms, both partners also interact with other species. Cooperating or cheating within the mutualism may influence interactions with these third-parties, such as herbivores, through antagonistic or other subtle interactions with the ants and plants. This thesis investigates the effect of third-party interactions on the association between the ant-plant, Acacia drepanolobium, and its three obligate ant partners: Crematogaster mimosae, Crematogaster nigriceps and Tetraponera penzigi. Field experiments demonstrated that the identity of the ant species inhabiting the plant has a significant effect on levels of herbivory, both by vertebrates and by phytophagous insects. Aggressive ant inhabitants, particularly C. mimosae and C. nigriceps, are able to limit herbivory to a much greater degree than workers of the timid T. penzigi. Ant-association also has a strong effect on reproduction by the host, but no effect on infestation by seed-predators and parasitoids. Field experiments further indicated that the highly effective ant inhabitants, C. mimosae and C. nigriceps are able to 'eavesdrop' on a volatile plant alarm signal, methyl jasmonate (as part of a herbivore induced plant volatile signal), whereas workers of T. penzigi do not respond to these plant signals. Thus listening and responding to communication signals produced by African ant-acacias when they 'cry for help' is an important characteristic of high quality ant mutualists in this system. Association with third-party species includes parasitism by a lycaenid butterfly, Anthene hodsoni, an obligate associate of the aggressive ant C. mimosae, and behavioral experiments showed that females use ants as cues in laying eggs. Stable isotope analysis revealed that larvae are not simply phytophagous, but prey on the ants inside the domatia of the plant. At least 48 species of lycaenid butterfly have been documented to exploit acacias within the range of the ant-plants, 24 of these were observed on ant-plants as part of this study. Third-party species interactions with ants also result in resource partitioning and divergence of trophic niches: T. penzigi appears to be cultivating and dispersing fungi on a matrix of leaf-matter harvested from its host-plants; C. mimosae tends scale insects in the domatia; and both Crematogaster species feed on insects that they hunt both on and off the host tree. C. nigriceps relies more on prey than any of the other ants. Thus each partner manipulates the plant in a different way and occupies a distinct niche, mediated in large part through interactions with third-party species. Recognition of the complex roles of multiple interacting species in shaping what have classically been viewed as simple two party ant-plant mutualisms is essential in understanding their persistence and abundance in nature.},

	abstract = {Plants respond to insect herbivory by emitting a specific subset of volatile compounds called herbivore-induced-plant-volatiles (HIPVs), which do not only mediate plant-insect interactions, but are also involved in plant-plant signaling and priming of neighboring plants. This dissertation investigated the volatiles involved in the chemo-ecological interactions between apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) and two of its main tortricid defoliators, namely the European species Pandemis heparana Denis and Schiffermüller and the North American species Pandemis pyrusana Kearfott. Studies were conducted to characterize the volatiles emitted from apple foliage that were either intact, mechanically-damaged or exposed to larval feeding by P. heparana. Sixteen of the characterized volatiles elicited consistent antennal responses in P. heparana adults. When the most promising volatiles were tested in the flight tunnel, only lures containing acetic acid in combination with either phenylacetonitrile or 2-phenylethanol were significantly attractive to P. heparana adults. A field trial conducted in Sweden demonstrated that traps baited with the same lure combinations were highly attractive to P. heparana also in field conditions. This work was replicated on P. pyrusana. Nine aromatic compounds and other 12 volatiles characterized in P. pyrusana-infested apple foliage were tested in the field in combination with acetic acid, but only phenylacetonitrile and 2-phenylethanol caught significantly more adult P. pyrusana than acetic acid alone. These two independent studies clearly showed that the combinations of acetic acid with either phenylacetonitrile or 2-phenylethanol are highly attractive to both P. heparana and P. pyrusana. The following studies aimed to prove the occurrence of plant-plant signaling and priming phenomena in apple. Indeed, apple plants that were exposed to HIPVs of neighboring conspecifics infested with P. heparana larvae responded to a subsequent infestation with a significantly higher emission of several induced volatiles with respect to non-exposed, infested plants, thus indicating a priming effect. Similar experiments performed with the root-feeding beetle Melolontha melolontha L. showed that its feeding damage on apple plants is able to trigger a systemic response, which leads to volatile-mediated plant-to plant signaling similarly to what observed in response to an aboveground damage. Knowledge gained from this work is essential for the development of new environmentally friendly techniques of insect pest control based of natural volatile organic compounds. ; embargoed},

	url = {https://ir.library.louisville.edu/honors/171},
	abstract = {Iron is an essential element required for plants to carry out metabolic functions such as photosynthesis, heme biosynthesis, and chlorophyll biosynthesis. Within Arabidopsis thaliana, eight ferric reduction oxidase (FRO) genes function in iron uptake and homeostasis with tissue specific expression. However, little else is known regarding the biological role of FROs. Recent studies identify the FRO gene family as particularly responsive to the green leaf plant derived volatile (GLV) cis-3-hexenyl acetate (z3HAC). Since z3HAC acts as a wound signal and cues unaffected parts of the plant to prime defenses prior to herbivory, an increase in FRO activity in response to volatile perception may suggest that these metalloreductases play a role in plant anti-herbivore defense. The objective of this study was to measure transcriptional responses of FROs to herbivore oral secretions (OS) and plant-derived volatile cues. Results of this study show FROs differentially increase expression levels in response to herbivory and volatile exposure. Specifically, z3HAC alone induced expression of FRO3, FRO4, and FRO6. In addition, a number of FROs were primed by the combination of z3HAC and Spodoptera exigua OS including FRO4 and FRO7, suggesting iron homeostasis in leaves may be important in plant anti-herbivore defense. Future work needs to identify a mechanism linking FROs and herbivory.},

	abstract = {At present, overexploitation of species, aggressive agricultural practices, land-use changes, biological invasions, pollution, and climate change represent, in descending order of magnitude, the main global-scale threats to biodiversity. Given that the majority of these phenomena represent threats also to plant–pollinator interactions worldwide, intensive research efforts across the world are focusing on disentangling the dynamics and structure of the p–p interactions, so that prevention, conservation, and restoration strategies can be effectively designed and implemented. In this context, this thesis focuses on the sensory ecology of pollination, in particular, on the role of floral signals as perceived by pollinating insects in structuring the pollination network of a natural community. I first find an unprecedented fine-tuning of floral scent and color implying a community-wide floral phenotypic integration according to the sensory systems of pollinators, especially bees. Next, by using innovative methods to analyze the pollination network of the same phryganic community, I find that network cohesiveness relates to floral scent and floral color as perceived by pollinators. Results suggest a hypothesis on the role of the profuse emissions of aromatic plants in mediterranean-type scrublands, and highlight the fundamental connection between bees and floral cues in this ecosystem. Floral sensory diversity emerges as an important component of functional diversity that could help designate influential plants in the community, to be used in targeted restoration practices for maintaining network dynamics and facilitative effects. Then, I analyze the network of associations between the insects and the volatile organic compounds of the plants in the community, as a new methodology for studying chemically-mediated plant–arthropod interactions. Finally, I focus on plant volatile compounds as natural products, and I built a geo-database of the chemical diversity of plants in Greece, by combining data published in the last 25 years. This approach allowed the development of the first chemodiversity maps, as a special case of natural product maps. ; Η βιοτική επικονίαση είναι μία οικοσυστημική λειτουργία-κλειδί για τη διατήρηση της φύσης και της παγκόσμιας πρωτογενούς παραγωγής. H διατήρηση καθώς και η εξέλιξη της χερσαίας βιοποικιλότητας της Γης εξαρτώνται από την ποιότητα και την αποτελεσματικότητα των αλληλεπιδράσεων αμοιβαιότητας μεταξύ ανθοφόρων φυτών και επικονιαστών. Επιπλέον, η επιβίωση των ανθρώπων βασίζεται, επίσης σε μεγάλο βαθμό, στους επικονιαστές, δεδομένου ότι περισσότερα από 1500 καλλιεργούμενα είδη φυτών παγκοσμίως επικονιάζονται από ζώα, κυρίως έντομα. Στις μέρες μας, όπου οι κύριες απειλές κατά της βιοποικιλότητας σε παγκόσμια κλίμακα αποδεδειγμένα δρουν και ενάντια στις επικονιαστικές σχέσεις, έρευνες σε όλον τον κόσμο επικεντρώνονται ολοένα και συχνότερα στην κατανόηση της δομής και της δυναμικής των αλληλεπιδράσεων φυτών–επικονιαστών, προκειμένου οι πρακτικές οικολογικής διατήρησης και αποκατάστασης να σχεδιάζονται και να εφαρμόζονται αποτελεσματικά. Η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή επικεντρώνεται στην αισθητηριακή οικολογία (sensory ecology) της επικονίασης, ειδικότερα στον τρόπο με τον οποίο τα σήματα που εκπέμπονται από τα άνθη και στοχεύουν στα αισθητηριακά συστήματα των επικονιαστών (όραση και όσφρηση) σχετίζονται με την πραγματοποιούμενη ανθική επισκεψιμότητα.

Τα ευρήματα αποκαλύπτουν μία ενδιαφέρουσα φαινοτυπική συνδιακύμανση του ανθικού αρώματος και χρώματος όπως το αντιλαμβάνονται οι επικονιαστές. Στη συνέχεια, τα δεδομένα αυτά συνθεωρούνται στην ανάλυση του δικτύου φυτών–επικονιαστών της μελετώμενης βιοκοινότητας και τα αποτελέσματα καταδεικνύουν σαφή συσχέτιση των ανθικών χαρακτήρων με τη συμπεριφορά, δηλ. τον λειτουργικό ρόλο των φυτών στο δίκτυο αλληλεπιδράσεων. Τα ευρήματα επιτρέπουν τον μελλοντικό σχεδιασμό στοχευμένων πρακτικών οικολογικής διατήρησης και αποκατάστασης βιοκοινοτήτων με βάση την αισθητηριακή ποικιλότητα της αρχικής βιοκοινότητας και εφαρμόζοντας στοχευμένες επιλογές ειδών-κλειδιών για την προσέλκυση συγκεκριμένων ομάδων εντόμων.

	abstract = {Plants respond to herbivory with the emission of induced plant volatiles. These volatiles may attract parasitic wasps (parasitoids) that attack the herbivores. Although in this sense the emission of volatiles has been hypothesized to be beneficial to the plant, it is still debated whether this is also the case under natural conditions because other organisms such as herbivores also respond to the emitted volatiles. One important group of organisms, the enemies of parasitoids, hyperparasitoids, has not been included in this debate because little is known about their foraging behaviour. Here, we address whether hyperparasitoids use herbivore-induced plant volatiles to locate their host. We show that hyperparasitoids find their victims through herbivore-induced plant volatiles emitted in response to attack by caterpillars that in turn had been parasitized by primary parasitoids. Moreover, only one of two species of parasitoids affected herbivore-induced plant volatiles resulting in the attraction of more hyperparasitoids than volatiles from plants damaged by healthy caterpillars. This resulted in higher levels of hyperparasitism of the parasitoid that indirectly gave away its presence through its effect on plant odours induced by its caterpillar host. Here, we provide evidence for a role of compounds in the oral secretion of parasitized caterpillars that induce these changes in plant volatile emission. Our results demonstrate that the effects of herbivore-induced plant volatiles should be placed in a community-wide perspective that includes species in the fourth trophic level to improve our understanding of the ecological functions of volatile release by plants. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the impact of species in the fourth trophic level should also be considered when developing Integrated Pest Management strategies aimed at optimizing the control of insect pests using parasitoids.

	abstract = {The codling moth, Cydia pomonella, is an important fruit pest worldwide. As nocturnal animals, adults depend to a large extent on olfactory cues for detection of food and mates, and, for females, oviposition sites. In insects, odor detection is mediated by odorant receptors (ORs) and ionotropic receptors (IRs), which ensure the specificity of the olfactory sensory neuron responses. In this study, our aim was to identify chemosensory receptors in the codling moth as a means to uncover new targets for behavioral interference. Using next-generation sequencing techniques, we identified a total of 43 candidate ORs, one gustatory receptor and 15 IRs in the antennal transcriptome. Through Blast and sequence similarity analyses we annotated the insect obligatory co-receptor ORco, five genes clustering in a conserved clade containing sex pheromone receptors, one homolog of the Bombyx mori female-enriched receptor BmorOR30 (but no homologs of the other B. mori female-enriched receptors) and one gene clustering in the sugar receptor family. Among the candidate IRs, we identified homologs of the two highly conserved co-receptors IR8a and IR25a, and one homolog of an IR involved in phenylethyl amine detection in Drosophila. Our results open for functional characterization of the chemosensory receptors of C. pomonella, with potential for new or refined applications of semiochemicals for control of this pest insect.

	abstract = {While the role of herbivore-induced volatiles in plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions is well documented aboveground, new evidence suggests that belowground volatile emissions can protect plants by attracting entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs). However, due to methodological limitations, no study has previously detected belowground herbivore-induced volatiles in the field or quantified their impact on attraction of diverse EPN species. Here we show how a belowground herbivore-induced volatile can enhance mortality of agriculturally significant root pests. First, in real time, we identified pregeijerene (1,5-dimethylcyclodeca-1,5,7-triene) from citrus roots 9–12 hours after initiation of larval Diaprepes abbreviatus feeding. This compound was also detected in the root zone of mature citrus trees in the field. Application of collected volatiles from weevil-damaged citrus roots attracted native EPNs and increased mortality of beetle larvae (D. abbreviatus) compared to controls in a citrus orchard. In addition, field applications of isolated pregeijerene caused similar results. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that pregeijerene increased pest mortality by attracting four species of naturally occurring EPNs in the field. Finally, we tested the generality of this root-zone signal by application of pregeijerene in blueberry fields; mortality of larvae (Galleria mellonella and Anomala orientalis) again increased by attracting naturally occurring populations of an EPN. Thus, this specific belowground signal attracts natural enemies of widespread root pests in distinct agricultural systems and may have broad potential in biological control of root pests.

Recent work suggests that gut microbiota not only provide nutrients, but also involve in the development and maintenance of the host immune system. However, the complexity, dynamics and types of interactions between the insect hosts and their gut microbiota are far from being well understood. Methods/Principal Findings: To determine the composition of the gut microbiota of two lepidopteran pests, Spodoptera littoralis and Helicoverpa armigera, we applied cultivation-independent techniques based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and microarray. The two insect species were very similar regarding high abundant bacterial families. Different bacteria colonize different niches within the gut. A core community, consisting of Enterococci, Lactobacilli, Clostridia, etc. was revealed in the insect larvae. These bacteria are constantly present in the digestion tract at relatively high frequency despite that developmental stage and diet had a great impact on shaping the bacterial communities. Some low-abundant species might become dominant upon loading external disturbances; the core community, however, did not change significantly. Clearly the insect gut selects for particular bacterial phylotypes. Conclusions: Because of their importance as agricultural pests, phytophagous Lepidopterans are widely used as experimental models in ecological and physiological studies. Our results demonstrated that a core microbial community exists in the insect gut, which may contribute to the host physiology. Host physiology and food, nevertheless, significantly influence some fringe bacterial species in the gut. The gut microbiota might also serve as a reservoir of microorganisms for ever-changing environments. Understanding these interactions might pave the way for developing novel pest control strategies.},

When understood, multitrophic interactions among plants, pests, diseases and their natural enemies can be exploited to increase crop production and reduce undesirable environmental impacts. Although the understanding of subterranean ecology is rudimentary compared to the perspective aboveground, technologies today vastly reduce traditional obstacles to studying cryptic communities. Here we emphasize advantages to integrating as much as possible the use of these methods in order to leverage the information gained from studying communities of soil organisms. PCR-based approaches to identify and quantify species (real time qPCR and next generation sequencing) greatly expand the ability to investigate food web interactions because there is less need for wide taxonomic expertise within research programs. Improved methods to capture and measure volatiles in the soil atmosphere in situ make it possible to detect and study chemical cues that are critical to communication across trophic levels. The application of SADIE to directly assess rather than infer spatial patterns in belowground agroecosystems has improved the ability to characterize relationships between organisms in space and time. We review selected methodology and use of these tools and describe some of the ways they were integrated to study soil food webs in Florida citrus orchards with the goal of developing new biocontrol approaches.

	abstract = {An imminent food crisis reinforces the need for novel strategies to increase crop yields worldwide. Effective control of pest insects should be part of such strategies, preferentially with reduced negative impact on the environment and optimal protection and utilization of existing biodiversity. Enhancing the presence and efficacy of native biological control agents could be one such strategy. Plant strengthener is a generic term for several commercially available compounds or mixtures of compounds that can be applied to cultivated plants in order to ‘boost their vigour, resilience and performance’. Studies into the consequences of boosting plant resistance against pests and diseases on plant volatiles have found a surprising and dramatic increase in the plants' attractiveness to parasitic wasps. Here, we summarize the results from these studies and present new results from assays that illustrate the great potential of two commercially available resistance elicitors. We argue that plant strengtheners may currently be the best option to enhance the attractiveness of cultivated plants to biological control agents. Other options, such as the genetic manipulation of the release of specific volatiles may offer future solutions, but in most systems, we still miss fundamental knowledge on which key attractants should be targeted for this approach.

	abstract = {Understanding the processing of odour mixtures is a focus in olfaction research. Through a neuroethological approach, we demonstrate that different odour types, sex and habitat cues are coded together in an insect herbivore. Stronger flight attraction of codling moth males, Cydia pomonella, to blends of female sex pheromone and plant odour, compared with single compounds, was corroborated by functional imaging of the olfactory centres in the insect brain, the antennal lobes (ALs). The macroglomerular complex (MGC) in the AL, which is dedicated to pheromone perception, showed an enhanced response to blends of pheromone and plant signals, whereas the response in glomeruli surrounding the MGC was suppressed. Intracellular recordings from AL projection neurons that transmit odour information to higher brain centres, confirmed this synergistic interaction in the MGC. These findings underscore that, in nature, sex pheromone and plant odours are perceived as an ensemble. That mating and habitat cues are coded as blends in the MGC of the AL highlights the dual role of plant signals in habitat selection and in premating sexual communication. It suggests that the MGC is a common target for sexual and natural selection in moths, facilitating ecological speciation. PMID:23595270},

	abstract = {Plant volatiles mediate host discrimination and host finding in phytophagous insects. Understanding how insects recognize these signals is a current challenge in chemical ecology research. Pear ester, ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate, is a powerful, bisexual attractant of codling moth Cydia pomonella (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) and strongly synergizes the male response to female-produced sex pheromone. We show here that the codling moth odorant receptor (OR) CpomOR3 is dedicated to detecting this plant volatile. Heterologous expression of CpomOR3 in Drosophila T1 trichoid and ab3A basiconic sensilla, followed by a screening with codling moth pheromone compounds and known plant volatile attractants, confirms that CpomOR3 binds to pear ester. Although CpomOR3 does not respond to any of the pheromone components tested, a phylogenetic analysis of lepidopteran chemosensory receptor genes reveals a close relationship of CpomOR3 with pheromone receptors (PRs) in moths. This corroborates the interaction of ecological and social chemosensory cues during premating communication. The finding that a plant volatile compound, pear ester, is a specific ligand for a PR-like lepidopteran receptor adds to our understanding of insect-plant interactions and emphasizes the interaction of natural and sexual selection during the phylogenetic divergence of insect herbivores.},

	url = {https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6458},
	abstract = {Abstract The search for mates and food is mediated by volatile chemicals. Insects sense food odorants and sex pheromones through odorant receptors (ORs) and pheromone receptors (PRs), which are expressed in olfactory sensory neurons. Molecular phylogenetics of ORs, informed by behavioral and functional data, generates sound hypotheses for the identification of semiochemicals driving olfactory behavior. Studying orthologous receptors and their ligands across taxa affords insights into the role of chemical communication in reproductive isolation and phylogenetic divergence. The female sex pheromone of green budworm moth Hedya nubiferana (Lepidoptera, Totricidae) is a blend of two unsaturated acetates, only a blend of both elicits male attraction. Females produce in addition codlemone, which is the sex pheromone of another tortricid, codling moth Cydia pomonella. Codlemone also attracts green budworm moth males. Concomitantly, green budworm and codling moth males are attracted to the host plant volatile pear ester. A congruent behavioral response to the same pheromone and plant volatile in two tortricid species suggests co‐occurrence of dedicated olfactory channels. In codling moth, one PR is tuned to both compounds, the sex pheromone codlemone and the plant volatile pear ester. Our phylogenetic analysis finds that green budworm moth expresses an orthologous PR gene. Shared ancestry, and high levels of amino acid identity and sequence similarity, in codling and green budworm moth PRs offer an explanation for parallel attraction of both species to the same compounds. A conserved olfactory channel for a sex pheromone and a host plant volatile substantiates the alliance of social and habitat signals in insect chemical communication. Field attraction assays confirm that in silico investigations of ORs afford powerful predictions for an efficient identification of behavior‐modifying semiochemicals, for an improved understanding of the mechanisms of host plant attraction in insect herbivores and for the further development of sustainable insect control.},

In apple orchards, the new formulation attracted lacewing adults over a 4-week period, which correlated well with independent assessments of the longevity of the slow-release matrix measured through chemical analyses. In barley, lacewing eggs and larvae were significantly more abundant in treated plots, whereas a significant reduction of two aphid species was measured (98.9\% and 93.6\% of population reduction, for Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi, respectively). Results show the potential for semiochemical-based targeted recruitment of lacewings to enhance biological control of aphids in a field setting. Further research should enhance selective recruitment by rewarding attracted natural enemies and by optimizing the application technique.},

	abstract = {Multitrophic interactions are likely to be altered by climate change but there is little empirical evidence relating the responses of herbivores and parasitoids to abiotic factors. Here we investigated the effects of drought on an above/belowground system comprising a generalist and a specialist aphid species (foliar herbivores), their parasitoids, and a dipteran species (root herbivore).We tested the hypotheses that: (1) high levels of drought stress and below-ground herbivory interact to reduce the performance of parasitoids developing in aphids; (2) drought stress and root herbivory change the profile of volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) emitted by the host plant; (3) parasitoids avoid ovipositing in aphids feeding on plants under drought stress and root herbivory. We examined the effect of drought, with and without root herbivory, on the olfactory response of parasitoids (preference), plant volatile emissions, parasitism success (performance), and the effect of drought on root herbivory. Under drought, percentage parasitism of aphids was reduced by about 40–55\% compared with well watered plants. There was a significant interaction between drought and root herbivory on the efficacy of the two parasitoid species, drought stress partially reversing the negative effect of root herbivory on percent parasitism. In the absence of drought, root herbivory significantly reduced the performance (e.g. fecundity) of both parasitoid species developing in foliar herbivores. Plant emissions of VOCs were reduced by drought and root herbivores, and in olfactometer experiments parasitoids preferred the odour from well-watered plants compared with other treatments. The present work demonstrates that drought stress can change the outcome of interactions between herbivores feeding above- and belowground and their parasitoids, mediated by changes in the chemical signals from plants to parasitoids. This provides a new insight into how the structure of terrestrial communities may be affected by drought.},

Here, we show that mycorrhizal mycelia can also act as a conduit for signalling between plants, acting as an early warning system for herbivore attack. Insect herbivory causes systemic changes in the production of plant volatiles, particularly methyl salicylate, making bean plants, Vicia faba, repellent to aphids but attractive to aphid enemies such as parasitoids. We demonstrate that these effects can also occur in aphid-free plants but only when they are connected to aphid-infested plants via a com-mon mycorrhizal mycelial network. This underground messaging system allows neighbouring plants to invoke herbivore defences before attack.

In this thesis, we investigated how plants integrate visual and olfactory signals. First, a system to measure plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was set up (chapter 2). Second, the effect of UV-B radiation on tomato and Arabidopsis thaliana VOC emissions was described and its regulation via TERPENE SYNTHASE gene expression and the UV-B photoreceptor UVR8 examined (chapter 3 and 4). Third, the interaction between UV-B and low red to far-red (R:FR) responses was investigated at the physiological and signal transduction level (chapter 5). In tomato, UV-B induced VOC emissions with differential timing: a first class of VOCs increased immediately upon UV-B exposure, a second class of compounds had a delayed response and a third class increased only after UV-B exposure stopped. This third class included monoterpenes and methyl salicylate (MeSA), compounds known to function as signals in ecological interactions. We identified six different monoterpenes that were induced by UV-B, but found no correlation between their induced emission and up-regulation of their TERPENE SYNTHASE (TPS) genes, except for β-phellandrene and TPS4 expression in leaves. Using Arabidopsis thaliana, we demonstrated that UV-B induces VOC emissions independent of the UV-B photoreceptor UVR8. These are the first data showing that some secondary metabolites are regulated by UV-B exposure in a UVR8-independent manner. In addition, comparing UV-B-mediated VOC emissions of tomato and A. thaliana revealed that (i) the timing of UV-B-induced monoterpene emissions and (ii) UV-B-induced MeSA emissions are species specific. By exposing A. thaliana to UV-B and low R:FR simultaneously, we demonstrated that UV-B represses low R:FR responses via the UVR8 pathway and that this interaction involves several components of the R:FR signalling network. Mutant studies indicated involvement in the UV-FR interaction of the early UVR8-signalling component HY5, growth-repressing DELLA proteins, central shade avoidance regulators PIF4 and PIF5, but possibly also PIF1 and PIF3, auxin-related and PIF-inhibiting PAR1, and photoreceptor-interacting PKS2. In addition, gene expression studies suggested a role for the PAR1-binding and BR-inducible transcription factor PRE1, as well as for HFR1, which inhibits PIF4 and PIF5 action. Concerning the involvement of hormones in the UV-FR interaction, we found that BR might be important, whereas we found no such evidence for auxin and GA. This thesis thus demonstrates that plant responses to distinct environmental cues interact, and that there is cross-talk between the intrinsic signalling pathways a plant uses to assess and respond to light quality changes. This is especially relevant when considering plant responses in patchy environments.},

	title = {Are birds in agricultural habitats attracted to plant volatiles?},
	url = {https://stud.epsilon.slu.se/13125/},
	abstract = {Birds’ ability to fly allows them to track resource abundance and relocate themselves to areas with more resources. It has been a longstanding belief that they forage mainly through visual cues due to their relatively small olfactory bulbs. However, a growing body of results show that birds use olfaction for communication, when choosing nesting material and detecting predators. Insectivorous birds can during foraging use herbivore-induced plant volatiles to identify infected trees, and have a preference for olfactory cues over visual cues. Induced plant volatiles are released during herbivorous attack as an indirect defense, attracting predatory arthropods and birds which are natural enemies of the herbivores. Birds, however, act also as top predator, meaning they prey on intermediate predators, thus releasing pest from suppression by predatory arthropods. The possibility that these birds use herbivore-induced plant volatiles to localize predatory arthropods have not yet been investigated, which is the aim of this study. We tested the attraction of birds to a common volatile compound, methyl salicylate (MeSa), and evaluated the importance of visual and olfactory cues in a three-way choice experiment in crop fields. Birds could choose between MeSa, neutral odor and no odor in three experimental setups: visible food, invisible food and artificial prey. Overall visits to all setups showed a slight preference for MeSa, with no difference between visible or hidden food. There was however a preference for visual cues when MeSa was presented without any food, next to a dish with odorless artificial prey. We observed that only certain species approached the experiment, mainly corvids and thrushes, thus our conclusions are limited to these taxa. Our results suggest that olfaction might be important for birds foraging in farmland habitats and could also influence the role of birds as biological pest control agents. ; Fåglarnas förmåga att flyga gör det möjligt för dem att spåra resursöverflöd och förflytta sig till områden med mer resurser och det har varit en långvarig uppfattning att de födosöker huvudsakligen genom visuella signaler på grund av deras relativt små luktlober. En växande mängd resultat visar emellertid att fåglar använder kemiska signaler i kommunikation, när de väljer häckningsmaterial och för att upptäcka rovdjur. Insektsätande fåglar kan under födosök använda herbivorinducerade, kemiska växtsignaler för att identifiera infekterade träd och föredrar olfaktoriska signaler över visuella signaler. Inducerade växtämnen släpps under herbivorangrepp som ett indirekt försvar, vilket lockar rovdjur och fåglar som är naturliga fiender till växtätarna. Fåglar lever dock också som topprovdjur, vilket innebär att de jagar rovdjursinsekter och därigenom frigör skadedjur från undertryck av dessa. Möjligheten att dessa fåglar använder herbivorinducerade växtsignaler för att lokalisera rovdjursinsekter är ännu inte undersökt, vilket är syftet med denna studie. Vi testade fåglars attraktion till en vanlig förening i växtsignaler, metylsalicylat (MeSA), och utvärderade betydelsen av visuella och olfaktoriska signaler i ett experiment med trevägsval i fält. Fåglarna kunde välja mellan MeSA, neutral lukt, och ingen lukt i tre experimentuppställningar: synlig mat, osynlig mat, och artificiellt byte. Övergripande besök på alla uppställningar visade en liten preferens för MeSA, utan skillnad mellan synlig eller dold mat. Det var dock en preferens för visuella signaler när MeSA presenterades utan byte, bredvid en skål med luktlöst artificiellt byte. Vi observerade att endast vissa arter närmade sig experimentet, främst korvider och trossar, så våra slutsatser är be-gränsade till dessa taxa. Våra resultat tyder på att luktsinnet kan vara viktigt för fåglar som födosöker i jordbruksmiljöer och kan också påverka fåglarnas roll inom biologisk skadedjursbekämpning.},

Plants and microbes have complex communication systems with important consequences for agriculture, human health, and ecosystem functioning. Eavesdropping, however, has mostly been studied in animal systems. In this review, we argue that eavesdropping is an important force shaping the ecology and evolution of communication in these non-animal systems. To date, studying eavesdropping in plants and microbes has been limited by the fact that signaler “intention” is often unclear: distinguishing signals that evolved to convey information from unintended cues is particularly difficult in plants and microbes, and the fitness consequences of signaling are rarely measured. We describe some of the main examples of eavesdropping in plant and microbial communication and point out other murkier cases were the molecular and physiological basis of communication are well-understood, but the evolutionary implications have not been addressed. We argue that these systems provide experimental tractability to test some of the predicted ecological and evolutionary consequences of eavesdropping, and that the particularities of these systems can lead to an increased understanding of eavesdropping, and its importance in biological communication.},

The result demonstrated that C. partellus deposited a significantly lower number of eggs and egg batches on Nyamula, Jowi and Cuba 91 maize plants exposed to B. brizantha with C. partellus eggs compared to nonexposed ones and the exposed hybrid variety.

Here, we show that mycorrhizal mycelia can also act as a conduit for signalling between plants, acting as an early warning system for herbivore attack. Insect herbivory causes systemic changes in the production of plant volatiles, particularly methyl salicylate, making bean plants, Vicia faba, repellent to aphids but attractive to aphid enemies such as parasitoids. We demonstrate that these effects can also occur in aphid-free plants but only when they are connected to aphid-infested plants via a common mycorrhizal mycelial network. This underground messaging system allows neighbouring plants to invoke herbivore defences before attack. Our findings demonstrate that common mycorrhizal mycelial networks can determine the outcome of multitrophic interactions by communicating information on herbivore attack between plants, thereby influencing the behaviour of both herbivores and their natural enemies.},

	url = {https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00972},
	abstract = {Olfaction is an essential sensory modality for insects and their olfactory environment is mostly made up of plant-emitted volatiles. The terrestrial vegetation produces an amazing diversity of volatile compounds, which are then transported, mixed, and degraded in the atmosphere. Each insect species expresses a set of olfactory receptors that bind part of the volatile compounds present in its habitat. Insect odorscapes are thus defined as species-specific olfactory spaces, dependent on the local habitat, and dynamic in time. Manipulations of pest-insect odorscapes are a promising approach to answer the strong demand for pesticide-free plant-protection strategies. Moreover, understanding their olfactory environment becomes a major concern in the context of global change and environmental stresses to insect populations. A considerable amount of information is available on the identity of volatiles mediating biotic interactions that involve insects. However, in the large body of research devoted to understanding how insects use olfaction to locate resources, an integrative vision of the olfactory environment has rarely been reached. This article aims to better apprehend the nature of the insect odorscape and its importance to insect behavioral ecology by reviewing the literature specific to different disciplines from plant ecophysiology to insect neuroethology. First, we discuss the determinants of odorscape composition, from the production of volatiles by plants (section “Plant Metabolism and Volatile Emissions”) to their filtering during detection by the olfactory system of insects (section “Insect Olfaction: How Volatile Plant Compounds Are Encoded and Integrated by the Olfactory System”). We then summarize the physical and chemical processes by which volatile chemicals distribute in space (section “Transportation of Volatile Plant Compounds and Spatial Aspects of the Odorscape”) and time (section “Temporal Aspects: The Dynamics of the Odorscape”) in the atmosphere. The following sections consider the ecological importance of background odors in odorscapes and how insects adapt to their olfactory environment. Habitat provides an odor background and a sensory context that modulate the responses of insects to pheromones and other olfactory signals (section “Ecological Importance of Odorscapes”). In addition, insects do not respond inflexibly to single elements in their odorscape but integrate several components of their environment (section “Plasticity and Adaptation to Complex and Variable Odorscapes”). We finally discuss existing methods of odorscape manipulation for sustainable pest insect control and potential future developments in the context of agroecology (section “Odorscapes in Plant Protection and Agroecology”).},

	abstract = {Insect herbivory activates plant defense mechanisms and releases a blend of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). These volatile compounds may be involved in plant-plant communication and induce defense response in undamaged plants. In this work, we investigated whether the exposure of sweet pepper plants to HIPVs [(Z)-3-hexenol, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate, (Z)-3-hexenyl butanoate, hexyl butanoate, methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate] activates the sweet pepper immune defense system. For this, healthy sweet pepper plants were individually exposed to the each of the above mentioned HIPVs over 48 h. The expression of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid related genes was quantified. Here, we show that all the tested volatiles induced plant defenses by upregulating the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signaling pathway. Additionally, the response of Frankliniella occidentalis, a key sweet pepper pest, and Orius laevigatus, the main natural enemy of F. occidentalis, to HIPV-exposed sweet pepper plants were studied in a Y-tube olfactometer. Only plants exposed to (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate and methyl salicylate repelled F. occidentalis whereas O. laevigatus showed a strong preference to plants exposed to (Z)-3-hexenol, (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate, (Z)-3-hexenyl butanoate, methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate. Our results show that HIPVs act as elicitors to sweet pepper plant defenses by enhancing defensive signaling pathways. We anticipate our results to be a starting point for integrating HIPVs-based approaches in sweet pepper pest management systems which may provide a sustainable strategy to manage insect pests in horticultural plants.},

The flower of the host plant V. unguiculata was a stimulus for egg-laying by M. vitrata in an oviposition bioassay. Commercial longifolene, β-caryophyllene, linalool, geraniol, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate were used as stimulus. Each one elicited dose-dependent electroantennogram responses in female M. vitrata, and all but longifolene stimulated oviposition, when presented singly. Beta-caryophyllene was the most active stimulant, similar to that of the flower of V. unguiculata, and eliciting a dose-dependent oviposition response. Either olfaction or gustation was sufficient to mediate an oviposition response to V. unguiculata floral volatiles: intact M. vitrata responded to β-caryophyllene whether or not they could contact the source of the volatiles, and females with amputated antennae responded if allowed to contact the source. We believe this is the first demonstration in a moth where β-caryophyllene from the host plant was able to mediate an oviposition response. As β-caryophyllene is widely expressed by non-host plants, we suggest that its role in stimulating oviposition could be exploited as part of a push–pull strategy for pest management in which β-caryophyllene-expressing non-host plants provide a population sink for M. vitrata.

	abstract = {Silicon (Si) is important in plant defenses that operate in a direct manner against herbivores, and work in rice (Oryza sativa) has established that this is mediated by the jasmonate signaling pathway. Plant defenses also operate indirectly, by the production of herbivore induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that attract predators and parasitoids of herbivores. These indirect defenses too are mediated by the jasmonate pathway but no earlier work has demonstrated an effect of Si on HIPVs. In this study, we tested the effect of Si supplementation versus Si deprivation to rice plants on subsequent HIPV production following feeding by the important pest, rice leaffolder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis). Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analyses showed lower production of α-bergamotene, β-sesquiohellandrene, hexanal 2-ethyl, and cedrol from +Si herbivore-infested plants compared with -Si infested plants. These changes in plant chemistry were ecologically significant in altering the extent to which parasitoids were attracted to infested plants. Adult females of Trathala flavo-orbitalis and Microplitis mediator both exhibited greater attraction to the HIPV blend of +Si plants infested with their respective insect hosts compared to -Si infested plants. In equivalent studies using RNAi rice plants in which jasmonate perception was silenced there was no equivalent change to the HIPV blend associated with Si treatment; indicating that the effects of Si on HIPVs are modulated by the jasmonate pathway. Further, this work demonstrates that silicon alters the HIPV blend of herbivore-infested rice plants. The significance of this finding is that there are no earlier-published studies of this phenomenon in rice or any other plant species. Si treatment to crops offers scope for enhancing induced, indirect defenses and associated biological control of pests because parasitoids are more strongly attracted by the HIPVs produced by +Si plants.

	abstract = {Plant quality and predators are important factors affecting herbivore population growth, but how they interact to regulate herbivore populations is not well understood. We manipulated jasmonate-induced plant resistance, exposure to the natural predator community and herbivore density to test how these factors jointly and independently affect herbivore population growth. On low-resistance plants, the predator community was diverse and abundant, promoting high predator consumption rates. On high-resistance plants, the predator community was less diverse and abundant, resulting in low predator consumption rate. Plant resistance only directly regulated aphid population growth on predator-excluded plants. When predators were present, plant resistance indirectly regulated herbivore population growth by changing the impact of predators on the herbivorous prey. A possible mechanism for the interaction between plant resistance and predation is that methyl salicylate, a herbivore-induced plant volatile attractive to predators, was more strongly induced in low-resistance plants. Increased plant resistance reduced predator attractant lures, preventing predators from locating their prey. Low-resistance plants may regulate herbivore populations via predators by providing reliable information on prey availability and increasing the effectiveness of predators. PMID:28878062},

	abstract = {Insects use sensitive olfactory systems to detect relevant host volatiles and avoid unsuitable hosts in a complex environmental odor landscape. Insects with short lifespans, such as gall midges (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), are under strong selection pressure to detect and locate suitable hosts for their offspring in a short period of time. Ephemeral gall midges constitute excellent models for investigating the role of olfaction in host choice, host shift, and speciation. Midges mate near their site of emergence and females migrate in order to locate hosts for oviposition, thus females are expected to be more responsive to olfactory cues emitted by the host compared to males. In this study, we explored the correlation between host choice and the function of the peripheral olfactory system in 12 species of gall midges, including species with close phylogenetic relationships that use widely different host plants and more distantly related gall midge species that use similar hosts. We tested the antennal responses of males and females of the 12 species to a blend of 45 known insect attractants using coupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection. When the species-specific response profiles of the gall midges were compared to a newly generated molecular-based phylogeny, we found they responded to the compounds in a sex- and species-specific manner. We found the physiological response profiles of species that use annual host plants, and thus have to locate their host every season, are similar for species with similar hosts despite large phylogenetic distances. In addition, we found closely related species with perennial hosts demonstrated odor response profiles that were consistent with their phylogenetic history. The ecology of the gall midges affects the tuning of the peripheral olfactory system, which in turn demonstrates a correlation between olfaction and speciation in the context of host use.

	abstract = {Abstract Plants can use induced volatiles to detect herbivore‐ and pathogen‐attacked neighbors and prime their defenses. Several individual volatile priming cues have been identified, but whether plants are able to integrate multiple cues from stress‐related volatile blends remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how maize plants respond to two herbivore‐induced volatile priming cues with complementary information content, the green leaf volatile (Z)‐3‐hexenyl acetate (HAC) and the aromatic volatile indole. In the absence of herbivory, HAC directly induced defence gene expression, whereas indole had no effect. Upon induction by simulated herbivory, both volatiles increased jasmonate signalling, defence gene expression, and defensive secondary metabolite production and increased plant resistance. Plant resistance to caterpillars was more strongly induced in dual volatile‐exposed plants than plants exposed to single volatiles.. Induced defence levels in dual volatile‐exposed plants were significantly higher than predicted from the added effects of the individual volatiles, with the exception of induced plant volatile production, which showed no increase upon dual‐exposure relative to single exposure. Thus, plants can integrate different volatile cues into strong and specific responses that promote herbivore defence induction and resistance. Integrating multiple volatiles may be beneficial, as volatile blends are more reliable indicators of future stress than single cues. PMID:30195252},

	abstract = {The sesquiterpene cyclase epi-isozizaene synthase (EIZS) catalyzes the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to form the tricyclic hydrocarbon precursor of the antibiotic albaflavenone. The hydrophobic active site pocket of EIZS serves as a template as it binds and chaperones the flexible substrate and carbocation intermediates through the conformations required for a multistep reaction sequence. We previously demonstrated that the substitution of hydrophobic residues with other hydrophobic residues remolds the template and expands product chemodiversity. Here, we show that the substitution of hydrophobic residues—specifically, Y69, F95, F96, and W203—with polar side chains also yields functional enzyme catalysts that expand product chemodiversity. Fourteen new EIZS mutants are reported that generate product arrays in which eight new sesquiterpene products have been identified. Of note, some mutants generate acyclic and cyclic hydroxylated products, suggesting that the introduction of polarity in the hydrophobic pocket facilitates the binding of water capable of quenching carbocation intermediates. Furthermore, the substitution of polar residues for F96 yields high-fidelity sesquisabinene synthases. Crystal structures of selected mutants reveal that residues defining the three-dimensional contour of the hydrophobic pocket can be substituted without triggering significant structural changes elsewhere in the active site. Finally, more radical nonpolar–polar amino acid substitutions should be considered when terpenoid cyclase active sites are remolded by mutagenesis with the goal of exploring and expanding product chemodiversity.},

	abstract = {The global spread of vector-borne diseases remains a worrying public health threat, raising the need for development of new combat strategies for vector control. Knowledge of vector ecology can be exploited in this regard, including plant feeding; a critical resource that mosquitoes of both sexes rely on for survival and other metabolic processes. However, the identity of plant species mosquitoes feed on in nature remains largely unknown. By testing the hypothesis about selectivity in plant feeding, we employed a DNA-based approach targeting trnH-psbA and matK genes and identified host plants of field-collected Afro-tropical mosquito vectors of dengue, Rift Valley fever and malaria being among the most important mosquito-borne diseases in East Africa. These included three plant species for Aedes aegypti (dengue), two for both Aedes mcintoshi and Aedes ochraceus (Rift Valley fever) and five for Anopheles gambiae (malaria). Since plant feeding is mediated by olfactory cues, we further sought to identify specific odor signatures that may modulate host plant location. Using coupled gas chromatography (GC)-electroantennographic detection, GC/mass spectrometry and electroantennogram analyses, we identified a total of 21 antennally-active components variably detected by Ae. aegypti, Ae. mcintoshi and An. gambiae from their respective host plants. Whereas Ae. aegypti predominantly detected benzenoids, Ae. mcintoshi detected mainly aldehydes while An. gambiae detected sesquiterpenes and alkenes. Interestingly, the monoterpenes β-myrcene and (E)-β-ocimene were consistently detected by all the mosquito species and present in all the identified host plants, suggesting that they may serve as signature cues in plant location. This study highlights the utility of molecular approaches in identifying specific vector-plant associations, which can be exploited in maximizing control strategies such as such as attractive toxic sugar bait and odor-bait technology.

They produce many of our foods, beverages and industrial chemicals, challenge us as pathogens, and provide models for the study of our own biology. However, few species are regularly studied and much of their ecology remains unclear, hindering the development of knowledge that is needed to improve the relationships between humans and yeasts. There is increasing evidence that insects are an essential component of ascomycetous yeast ecology. We propose a ‘dispersal–encounter hypothesis' whereby yeasts are dispersed by insects between ephemeral, spatially disparate sugar resources, and insects, in turn, obtain the benefits of an honest signal from yeasts for the sugar resources. We review the relationship between yeasts and insects through three main examples: social wasps, social bees and beetles, with some additional examples from fruit flies. Ultimately, we suggest that over the next decades, consideration of these ecological and evolutionary relationships between insects and yeasts will allow prediction of where new yeast diversity is most likely to be discovered, particularly yeasts with traits of interest to human industry.

Whether HIPVs can also mediate tritrophic interactions by influencing the attractiveness of the herbivores themselves remains unknown. We explored this question by studying the role of indole, a common HIPV in the plant kingdom. We found that herbivory-induced indole increases the recruitment of the solitary endoparasitoid Microplitis rufiventris to maize plants that are induced by Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars. Surprisingly, however, indole reduces parasitoid recruitment when the caterpillars themselves are present on the plants. Further experiments revealed that indole exposure renders S. littoralis caterpillars unattractive to M. rufiventris, leading to an overall reduction in attractiveness of plant-herbivore complexes. Furthermore, indole increases S. littoralis resistance and decreases M. rufiventris parasitization success. S. littoralis caterpillars are repelled by indole in the absence of M. rufiventris but specifically stop avoiding the volatile in the presence of the parasitoid. Our study shows how an HIPV can undermine tritrophic interactions by reducing the suitability and attractiveness of caterpillars to parasitoids. PMID:29774237},

	abstract = {The jasmonate hormones are essential regulators of plant defense against herbivores and include several dozen derivatives of the oxylipin jasmonic acid (JA). Among these, the conjugate jasmonoyl isoleucine (JA-Ile) has been shown to interact directly with the jasmonate co-receptor complex to regulate responses to jasmonate signaling. However, functional studies indicate that some aspects of jasmonate-mediated defense are not regulated by JA-Ile. Thus, it is not clear whether JA-Ile is best characterized as the master jasmonate regulator of defense, or if it regulates more specific aspects. We investigated possible functions of JA-Ile in anti-herbivore resistance of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata, a model system for plant-herbivore interactions. We first analyzed the soluble and volatile secondary metabolomes of irJAR4xirJAR6, asLOX3, and WT plants, as well as an RNAi line targeting the jasmonate co-receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (irCOI1), following a standardized herbivory treatment. irJAR4xirJAR6 were the most similar to WT plants, having a ca. 60\% overlap in differentially regulated metabolites with either asLOX3 or irCOI1. In contrast, while at least 25 volatiles differed between irCOI1 or asLOX3 and WT plants, there were few or no differences in herbivore-induced volatile emission between irJAR4xirJAR6 and WT plants, in glasshouse- or field-collected samples. We then measured the susceptibility of jasmonate-deficient vs. JA-Ile-deficient plants in nature, in comparison to wild-type (WT) controls, and found that JA-Ile-deficient plants (irJAR4xirJAR6) are much better defended even than a mildly jasmonate-deficient line (asLOX3). The differences among lines could be attributed to differences in damage from specific herbivores, which appeared to prefer either one or the other jasmonate-deficient phenotype. We further investigated the elicitation of one herbivore-induced volatile known to be jasmonate-regulated and to mediate resistance to herbivores: (E)-α-bergamotene. We found that JA was a more potent elicitor of (E)-α-bergamotene emission than was JA-Ile, and when treated with JA, irJAR4xirJAR6 plants emitted 20- to 40-fold as much (E)-α-bergamotene than WT. We conclude that JA-Ile regulates specific aspects of herbivore resistance in N. attenuata. This specificity may allow plants flexibility in their responses to herbivores and in managing trade-offs between resistance, vs. growth and reproduction, over the course of ontogeny. PMID:29963064},

However, their composition in tropical forests remains poorly characterized. As a part of tree identification, the 'smell' of damaged trunks is widely used, but is highly subjective. Here, we analyzed trunk volatile monoterpene emissions from 15 species of the genus Protium in the central Amazon. By normalizing the abundances of 28 monoterpenes, 9 monoterpene 'fingerprint' patterns emerged, characterized by a distinct dominant monoterpene. While 4 of the 'fingerprint' patterns were composed of multiple species, 5 were composed of a single species. Moreover, among individuals of the same species, 6 species had a single 'fingerprint' pattern, while 9 species had two or more 'fingerprint' patterns among individuals. A comparison of 'fingerprints' between 2015 and 2017 from 15 individuals generally showed excellent agreement, demonstrating a strong dependence on species identity, but not time of collection. The results are consistent with a previous study that found multiple divergent copies of monoterpene synthase enzymes in Protium. We conclude that the monoterpene 'fingerprint' database has important implications for constraining Protium species identification and phylogenetic relationships and enhancing understanding of physiological and ecological functions of resins and their potential commercial applications.},

Prior discussion of phytobiomes has focused heavily on plant-associated bacterial and fungal assemblages, but the phytobiomes concept covers all factors that influence plant function. Here we discuss various management considerations, including abiotic conditions (e.g., soil and nutrient applications), microorganisms (e.g., bacterial and fungal assemblages, bacterial and fungal inoculants, and viruses), macroorganisms (e.g., arthropods and plant genetics), and societal factors (e.g., communication approaches and technology diffusion).

	abstract = {Microalgae have major functions in global biogeochemical cycles and are promising sources of renewable energy, yet the relationships between algal hosts and their associated microbiomes remain relatively underexplored. Understanding community organization of microalgal microbiomes, such as how algal species identity influences bacterial community structure, will aid in efforts to engineer more efficient phototrophic ecosystems. Here, we examined the community assembly of phycosphere-associated (attached) and free-living bacterial taxa associated with two marine microalgae: the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and eustigmatophyte Microchloropsis salina. Samples were collected from outdoor mesocosms, raceway ponds, and laboratory enrichments, and bacterial taxa identified by 16S rRNA gene sequences. In outdoor mesocosms, we found distinct bacterial taxa associated with each algal species, including the Cytophagaceae and Rhodobacteraceae families with P. tricornutum, and Rhodobacteraceae, Hyphomonadaceae, and Saprospiraceae with M. salina. Additionally, there were host-specific differences in the bacterial genera associated with the phycosphere, including Novosphingobium and Rhodopirellula with P. tricornutum, and Methylophaga and Dyadobacter with M. salina. Bacterial communities from outdoor monoalgal P. tricornutum and polyalgal P. tricornutum/M. salina samples were used as inocula for laboratory enrichments with axenic P. tricornutum. Here, similar bacterial communities emerged, suggesting that the algal host exerts substantial influence over bacterial community assembly. Further enrichments for phycosphere-association revealed differing outcomes of community assembly processes contingent on the initial community composition. Phycosphere-associated communities from monoalgal P. tricornutum mesocosms were highly similar to one another, suggesting deterministic processes, whereas cultures from mixed M. salina/P. tricornutum raceways followed two apparent paths differentiated by the stochastic loss of specific community members and convergence towards or further deviation from the monoalgal samples. These results demonstrate that algal-associated bacterial communities are controlled by algal host, culture conditions, and the initial inoculum composition of the algal microbiome, and this knowledge can inform the engineering of more productive algal systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract The entire process of agricultural and horticultural food production is unsustainable as practiced by current highly intensive industrial systems. Energy consumption is particularly intensive for cultivation, and for fertilizer production and its incorporation into soil. Provision of nitrogen contributes a major source of the greenhouse gas, N2O. All losses due to pests, diseases and weeds are of food for which the carbon footprint has already been committed and so crop protection becomes an even greater concern. The rapidly increasing global need for food and the aggravation of associated problems by the effects of climate change create a need for new and sustainable crop protection. The overall requirement for sustainability is to remove seasonal inputs, and consequently all crop protection will need to be delivered via the seed or other planting material. Although genetic modification (GM) has transformed the prospects of sustainable crop protection, considerably more development is essential for the realisation of the full potential of GM and thereby consumer acceptability. Secondary plant metabolism offers wider and perhaps more robust new crop protection via GM and can be accomplished without associated yield loss because of the low level of photosynthate diverted for plant defence by secondary metabolism. Toxic mechanisms can continue to be targeted but exploiting non‐toxic regulatory and signalling mechanisms should be the ultimate objective. There are many problems facing these proposals, both technical and social, and these are discussed but it is certainly not possible to stay where we are in terms of sustainability. The evidence for success is mounting and the technical opportunities from secondary plant metabolism are discussed here. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {The hawkmoth Manduca sexta and one of its preferred hosts in the North American Southwest, Datura wrightii, share a model insect–plant relationship based on mutualistic and antagonistic life-history traits. D. wrightii is the innately preferred nectar source and oviposition host for M. sexta. Hence, the hawkmoth is an important pollinator while the M. sexta larvae are specialized herbivores of the plant. Olfactory detection of plant volatiles plays a crucial role in the behavior of the hawkmoth. In vivo, the odorant receptor coreceptor (Orco) is an obligatory component for the function of odorant receptors (ORs), a major receptor family involved in insect olfaction. We used CRISPR-Cas9 targeted mutagenesis to knock out (KO) the MsexOrco gene to test the consequences of a loss of OR-mediated olfaction in an insect–plant relationship. Neurophysiological characterization revealed severely reduced antennal and antennal lobe responses to representative odorants emitted by D. wrightii. In a wind-tunnel setting with a flowering plant, Orco KO hawkmoths showed disrupted flight orientation and an ablated proboscis extension response to the natural stimulus. The Orco KO gravid female displayed reduced attraction toward a nonflowering plant. However, more than half of hawkmoths were able to use characteristic odor-directed flight orientation and oviposit on the host plant. Overall, OR-mediated olfaction is essential for foraging and pollination behaviors, but plant-seeking and oviposition behaviors are sustained through additional OR-independent sensory cues.

	abstract = {The emissions, deposition, and chemistry of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are thought to be influenced by underlying landscape heterogeneity at intermediate horizontal scales of several hundred meters across different forest subtypes within a tropical forest. Quantitative observations and scientific understanding at these scales, however, remain lacking, in large part due to a historical absence of canopy access and suitable observational approaches. Herein, horizontal heterogeneity in VOC concentrations in the near-canopy atmosphere was examined by sampling from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flown horizontally several hundred meters over the plateau and slope forests in central Amazonia during the morning and early afternoon periods of the wet season of 2018. Unlike terpene concentrations, the isoprene concentrations in the near-canopy atmosphere over the plateau forest were 60\% greater than those over the slope forest. A gradient transport model constrained by the data suggests that isoprene emissions differed by 220 to 330\% from these forest subtypes, which is in contrast to a 0\% difference implemented in most present-day biosphere emissions models (i.e., homogeneous emissions). Finally, quantifying VOC concentrations, emissions, and other processes at intermediate horizontal scales is essential for understanding the ecological and Earth system roles of VOCs and representing them in climate and air quality models.},

	abstract = {One barrier to predicting biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in a changing climate can be attributed to the complex nature of plant volatile emissions. Plant volatile emissions are dynamic over space and time, and change in response to environmental stressors. This study investigated SOA production from emissions of healthy and aphid-stressed Scots pine saplings via dark ozonolysis and photooxidation chemistry. Laboratory experiments using a batch reaction chamber were used to investigate SOA production from different plant volatile mixtures. The volatile mixture from healthy plants included monoterpenes, aromatics, and a small amount of sesquiterpenes. The biggest change in the volatile mixture for aphid-stressed plants was a large increase (from 1.4 to 7.9 ppb) in sesquiterpenes—particularly acyclic sesquiterpenes, such as the farnesene isomers. Acyclic sesquiterpenes had different effects on SOA production depending on the chemical mechanism. Farnesenes suppressed SOA formation from ozonolysis with a 9.7–14.6\% SOA mass yield from healthy plant emissions and a 6.9–10.4\% SOA mass yield from aphid-stressed plant emissions. Ozonolysis of volatile mixtures containing more farnesenes promoted fragmentation reactions, which produced higher volatility oxidation products. In contrast, plant volatile mixtures containing more farnesenes did not appreciably change SOA production from photooxidation. SOA mass yields ranged from 10.8 to 23.2\% from healthy plant emissions and 17.8–26.8\% for aphid-stressed plant emissions. This study highlights the potential importance of acyclic terpene chemistry in a future climate regime with an increased presence of plant stress volatiles. PMID:31565682},

	abstract = {Olfaction is an essential sensory modality for insects and their olfactory environment is mostly made up of plant-emitted volatiles. The terrestrial vegetation produces an amazing diversity of volatile compounds, which are then transported, mixed, and degraded in the atmosphere. Each insect species expresses a set of olfactory receptors that bind part of the volatile compounds present in its habitat. Insect odorscapes are thus defined as species-specific olfactory spaces, dependent on the local habitat, and dynamic in time. Manipulations of pest-insect odorscapes are a promising approach to answer the strong demand for pesticide-free plant-protection strategies. Moreover, understanding their olfactory environment becomes a major concern in the context of global change and environmental stresses to insect populations. A considerable amount of information is available on the identity of volatiles mediating biotic interactions that involve insects. However, in the large body of research devoted to understanding how insects use olfaction to locate resources, an integrative vision of the olfactory environment has rarely been reached. This article aims to better apprehend the nature of the insect odorscape and its importance to insect behavioral ecology by reviewing the literature specific to different disciplines from plant ecophysiology to insect neuroethology. First, we discuss the determinants of odorscape composition, from the production of volatiles by plants (section “Plant Metabolism and Volatile Emissions”) to their filtering during detection by the olfactory system of insects (section “Insect Olfaction: How Volatile Plant Compounds Are Encoded and Integrated by the Olfactory System”). We then summarize the physical and chemical processes by which volatile chemicals distribute in space (section “Transportation of Volatile Plant Compounds and Spatial Aspects of the Odorscape”) and time (section “Temporal Aspects: The Dynamics of the Odorscape”) in the atmosphere. The following sections consider the ecological importance of background odors in odorscapes and how insects adapt to their olfactory environment. Habitat provides an odor background and a sensory context that modulate the responses of insects to pheromones and other olfactory signals (section “Ecological Importance of Odorscapes”). In addition, insects do not respond inflexibly to single elements in their odorscape but integrate several components of their environment (section “Plasticity and Adaptation to Complex and Variable Odorscapes”). We finally discuss existing methods of odorscape manipulation for sustainable pest insect control and potential future developments in the context of agroecology (section “Odorscapes in Plant Protection and Agroecology”).

	abstract = {In the present article we discuss why, in our view, the term ‘generalism’ to define the dietary breadth of a species is a misnomer and should be revised by entomologists/ecologists with the more exact title relating to the animal in question’s level of phagy—mono-, oligo, or polyphagy. We discard generalism as a concept because of the indisputable fact that all living organisms fill a unique ecological niche, and that entry and exit from such niches are the acknowledged routes and mechanisms driving ecological divergence and ultimately speciation. The term specialist is probably still useful and we support its continuing usage simply because all species and lower levels of evolutionary diverge are indeed specialists to a large degree. Using aphids and parasitoid wasps as examples, we provide evidence from the literature that even some apparently highly polyphagous agricultural aphid pest species and their wasp parasitoids are probably not as polyphagous as formerly assumed. We suggest that the shifting of plant hosts by herbivorous insects like aphids, whilst having positive benefits in reducing competition, and reducing antagonists by moving the target organism into ‘enemy free space’, produces trade-offs in survival, involving relaxed selection in the case of the manicured agro-ecosystem.

	abstract = {Terpenoids comprise tens of thousands of small molecule natural products that are widely distributed across all domains of life. Plants produce by far the largest array of terpenoids with various roles in development and chemical ecology. Driven by selective pressure to adapt to their specific ecological niche, individual species form only a fraction of the myriad plant terpenoids, typically representing unique metabolite blends. Terpene synthase (TPS) enzymes are the gatekeepers in generating terpenoid diversity by catalyzing complex carbocation-driven cyclization, rearrangement, and elimination reactions that enable the transformation of a few acyclic prenyl diphosphate substrates into a vast chemical library of hydrocarbon and, for a few enzymes, oxygenated terpene scaffolds. The seven currently defined clades (a-h) forming the plant TPS family evolved from ancestral triterpene synthase- and prenyl transferase-type enzymes through repeated events of gene duplication and subsequent loss, gain, or fusion of protein domains and further functional diversification. Lineage-specific expansion of these TPS clades led to variable family sizes that may range from a single TPS gene to families of more than 100 members that may further function as part of modular metabolic networks to maximize the number of possible products. Accompanying gene family expansion, the TPS family shows a profound functional plasticity, where minor active site alterations can dramatically impact product outcome, thus enabling the emergence of new functions with minimal investment in evolving new enzymes. This article reviews current knowledge on the functional diversity and molecular evolution of the plant TPS family that underlies the chemical diversity of bioactive terpenoids across the plant kingdom.},

The objective of this research was to identify the functions of two OBPs in Sitophilus zeamais. qRT-PCR and western blot (WB) were performed to investigate the expression profiles at the transcript and protein levels, respectively. Fluorescence competitive binding assays were used to measure the ability of the OBPs to bind to host volatiles, and a Y-tube olfactometer was used to verify the results (attraction/no response) via behavioral experiments. The RNAi was used to verify the function by knocking down the ability of proteins to bind odorants. qRT-PCR showed the highest expression SzeaOBP1 and SzeaOBP28 at the low-instar larva (LL) and eclosion adult (EA) stages, respectively. WB showed that both SzeaOBP1 and SzeaOBP28 were highly expressed in the EA stage. Fluorescence competitive binding assays indicated that SzeaOBP1 exhibited extremely high binding affinity with cetanol. SzeaOBP28 exhibited a pronounced binding affinity for 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde. The behavioral experiment showed that the adult S. zeamais responded strongly to 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde and valeraldehyde from Sorghum bicolor. The RNAi knockdown individuals displayed behavioral differences between normal insects and dsRNA (SzeaOBP1)-treated insects. We infer that they both have functions in perception and recognition of host volatiles, whereas SzeaOBP28 may also have other functions. PMID:31731819},

Its prominence and ubiquity make it uniquely suited for understanding how biochemistry within plants can mediate ecological consequences. Induction of the salicylic acid pathway has primary effects on the plant in which it is induced resulting in genetic, metabolomic, and physiologic changes as the plant adapts to challenges. These primary effects can in turn have secondary consequences for herbivores and pathogens attacking the plant. These secondary effects can both directly influence plant attackers and mediate indirect interactions between herbivores and pathogens. Additionally, stimulation of salicylic acid related defenses can affect natural enemies, predators and parasitoids, which can recruit to plant signals with consequences for herbivore populations and plant herbivory aboveground and belowground. These primary, secondary, and tertiary ecological consequences of salicylic acid signaling hold great promise for application in agricultural systems in developing sustainable high-yielding management practices that adapt to changing abiotic and biotic environments.

Recent studies have revealed that the holobiont of agaves and cacti comprises a diverse and structured microbiome, which might be important for its adaptation to drylands. Here, we investigated the functional signatures of the prokaryotic communities of the soil and the episphere, that includes the rhizosphere and phyllosphere, associated with the cultivated Agave tequilana and the native and sympatric Agave salmiana, Opuntia robusta and Myrtillocactus geometrizans by mining shotgun metagenomic data. Consistent with previous phylogenetic profiling, we found that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were the main represented phyla in the episphere of agaves and cacti, and that clustering of metagenomes correlated with the plant compartment. In native plants, genes related to aerobic anoxygenic phototrophy and photosynthesis were enriched in the phyllosphere and soil, while genes coding for biofilm formation and quorum sensing were enriched in both epiphytic communities. In the episphere of cultivated A. tequilana fewer genes were identified, but they belonged to similar pathways than those found in native plants. A. tequilana showed a depletion in several genes belonging to carbon metabolism, secondary metabolite biosynthesis and xenobiotic degradation suggesting that its lower microbial diversity might be linked to functional losses. However, this species also showed an enrichment in biofilm and quorum sensing in the epiphytic compartments, and evidence for nitrogen fixation in the rhizosphere. Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic markers were represented by Rhizobiales (Methylobacterium) and Rhodospirillales (Belnapia) in the phyllosphere, while photosystem genes were widespread in Bacillales and Cyanobacteria. Nitrogen fixation and biofilm formation genes were mostly related to Proteobacteria. These analyses support the idea of niche differentiation in the rhizosphere and phyllosphere of agaves and cacti and shed light on the potential mechanisms by which epiphytic microbial communities survive and colonize plants of arid and semiarid ecosystems. This study establishes a guideline for testing the relevance of the identified functional traits on the microbial community and the plant fitness.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests are acknowledged to be the largest global source of isoprene (C5H8) and monoterpenes (C10H16) emissions, with current synthesis studies suggesting few tropical species emit isoprenoids (20-38\%) and do so with highly variable emission capacities, including within the same genera. This apparent lack of a clear phylogenetic thread has created difficulties both in linking isoprenoid function with evolution and for the development of accurate biosphere-atmosphere models. In this work, we present a systematic emission study of "hyperdominant" tree species in the Amazon Basin. Across 162 individuals, distributed among 25 botanical families and 113 species, isoprenoid emissions were widespread among both early and late successional species (isoprene: 61.9\% of the species; monoterpenes: 15.0\%; both isoprene and monoterpenes: 9.7\%). The hyperdominant species (69) across the top five most abundant genera, which make up about 50\% of all individuals in the Basin, had a similar abundance of isoprenoid emitters (isoprene: 63.8\%; monoterpenes: 17.4\%; both 11.6\%). Among the abundant genera, only Pouteria had a low frequency of isoprene emitting species (15.8\% of 19 species). In contrast, Protium, Licania, Inga, and Eschweilera were rich in isoprene emitting species (83.3\% of 12 species, 61.1\% of 18 species, 100\% of 8 species, and 100\% of 12 species, respectively). Light response curves of individuals in each of the five genera showed light-dependent, photosynthesis-linked emission rates of isoprene and monoterpenes. Importantly, in every genus, we observed species with light-dependent isoprene emissions together with monoterpenes including β-ocimene. These observations support the emerging view of the evolution of isoprene synthases from β-ocimene synthases. Our results have important implications for understanding isoprenoid function-evolution relationships and the development of more accurate Earth System Models.},

	abstract = {The search for mates and food is mediated by volatile chemicals. Insects sense food odorants and sex pheromones through odorant receptors (ORs) and pheromone receptors (PRs), which are expressed in olfactory sensory neurons. Molecular phylogenetics of ORs, informed by behavioral and functional data, generates sound hypotheses for the identification of semiochemicals driving olfactory behavior. Studying orthologous receptors and their ligands across taxa affords insights into the role of chemical communication in reproductive isolation and phylogenetic divergence. The female sex pheromone of green budworm moth Hedya nubiferana (Lepidoptera, Totricidae) is a blend of two unsaturated acetates, only a blend of both elicits male attraction. Females produce in addition codlemone, which is the sex pheromone of another tortricid, codling moth Cydia pomonella. Codlemone also attracts green budworm moth males. Concomitantly, green budworm and codling moth males are attracted to the host plant volatile pear ester. A congruent behavioral response to the same pheromone and plant volatile in two tortricid species suggests co-occurrence of dedicated olfactory channels. In codling moth, one PR is tuned to both compounds, the sex pheromone codlemone and the plant volatile pear ester. Our phylogenetic analysis finds that green budworm moth expresses an orthologous PR gene. Shared ancestry, and high levels of amino acid identity and sequence similarity, in codling and green budworm moth PRs offer an explanation for parallel attraction of both species to the same compounds. A conserved olfactory channel for a sex pheromone and a host plant volatile substantiates the alliance of social and habitat signals in insect chemical communication. Field attraction assays confirm that in silico investigations of ORs afford powerful predictions for an efficient identification of behavior-modifying semiochemicals, for an improved understanding of the mechanisms of host plant attraction in insect herbivores and for the further development of sustainable insect control.},

The aim of this study was to perform non-destructive monitoring of algal culture systems, in the presence and absence of grazers, to identify potential biomarkers of incipient pond crashes. Here, we report ten volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are robustly generated by the marine alga, Microchloropsis salina, in the presence and/or absence of the marine grazer, Brachionus plicatilis. We cultured M. salina with and without B. plicatilis and collected in situ volatile headspace samples using thermal desorption tubes over the course of several days. Data from four experiments were aggregated, deconvoluted, and chromatographically aligned to determine VOCs with tentative identifications made via mass spectral library matching. VOCs generated by algae in the presence of actively grazing rotifers were confirmed via pure analytical standards to be pentane, 3-pentanone, 3-methylhexane, and 2-methylfuran. Six other VOCs were less specifically associated with grazing but were still commonly observed between the four replicate experiments. Through this work, we identified four biomarkers of rotifer grazing that indicate algal stress/death. This will aid machine learning algorithms to chemically define and diagnose algal mass production cultures and save algae cultures from imminent crash to make biofuel an alternative energy possibility.},

Odorant receptors (ORs), which are located on the dendritic membranes of olfactory sensory neurons in insects, are essential genes for recognizing attractants and repellents. In the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis, ORs that respond to sex pheromones have been characterized, but general ORs for plant odorants, especially for repellents, have not been identified. Nonanal is a plant volatile of maize that could result in avoidance of the oviposition process for female adults in O. furnacalis. In this study, we identified a female-biased OR that responds to nonanal using a Xenopus oocyte expression system. In addition, we found that OfurOR27 was also sensitive to two other compounds, octanal and 1-octanol. Behavioral analysis showed that octanal and 1-octanol also caused female avoidance of oviposition. Our results indicated that OfurOR27 is an OR that is sensitive to repellents. Moreover, the two newly identified repellents may help to develop a chemical ecology approach for pest control in O. furnacalis. PMID:32231586},

In contrast, less is known about the emission and source of acetic acid (AA). In this study, Populus trichocarpa (California poplar) leaves in different developmental stages were desiccated and quantified for total meOH and AA emissions together with bulk cell wall acetylation and methylation content. While young leaves showed high emissions of meOH (140 μmol m-2) and AA (42 μmol m-2), emissions were reduced in mature (meOH: 69\%, AA: 60\%) and old (meOH: 83\%, AA: 76\%) leaves. In contrast, the ratio of AA/meOH emissions increased with leaf development (young: 35\%, mature: 43\%, old: 82\%), mimicking the pattern of O-acetyl/methyl ester ratios of leaf bulk cell walls (young: 35\%, mature: 38\%, old: 51\%), which is driven by an increase in O-acetyl and decrease in methyl ester content with age. The results are consistent with meOH and AA emission sources from cell wall de-esterification, with young expanding tissues producing highly methylated pectin that is progressively demethyl-esterified. We highlight the quantification of AA/meOH emission ratios as a potential tool for rapid phenotype screening of structural carbohydrate esterification patterns.},

A DAMP can be any molecule that is usually not exposed to cells such as cell wall components, peptides, nucleic acid fragments, eATP and other compounds. DAMPs might be revealed upon tissue damage or during attack. Typically, DAMPs are derived from the injured organism. Almost all eukaryotes can generate and respond to DAMPs, including plants. Besides the molecules mentioned, certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be considered as DAMPs. Due to their chemical nature, VOCs are supposed to act not only locally and systemically in the same plant but also between plants. Here, we focus on damage-induced volatiles (DIVs) that might be regarded as DAMPs; we will review their origin, chemical nature, physiochemical properties, biological relevance and putative function in plant–plant communications. Moreover, we discuss the possibility to use such airborne DAMPs as eco-friendly compounds to stimulate natural defenses in agriculture in order to avoid pesticides. PMID:33178248},

Volatiles rapidly indicate competition or potential threat before these can take place, and they regulate and coordinate adaptation responses in neighbouring plants, fine‐tuning them to match the exact stress encountered. Ecological specificity and context‐dependency of plant–plant communication mediated by volatiles represent important factors that determine plant performance in specific environments. In this review, we synthesise the recent progress made in understanding the role of plant volatiles as mediators of plant interactions at the individual and community levels, highlighting the complexity of the plant receiver response to diverse volatile cues and signals and addressing how specific responses shape plant growth and survival. Finally, we outline the knowledge gaps and provide directions for future research. The complex dialogue between the emitter and receiver based on either volatile cues or signals determines the outcome of information exchange, which shapes the communication pattern between individuals at the community level and determines their ecological implications at other trophic levels.

	abstract = {Simple Summary Upon insect herbivory plants release herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) to elicit either direct antiherbivore defenses by intoxicating the herbivore or indirect defenses by attracting natural enemies. Insect herbivores use sophisticated detoxification systems, including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), to cope with plant defensive chemicals and insecticides. Many behaviors of insects are manipulated to a large extent by olfaction. However, few studies concern the role of olfaction in insect adaptation to xenobiotics. In this study we show that olfactory exposure of Helicoverpa armigera, a devastating pest of many important crop plants that has developed high levels of resistance to various insecticides, to four plant volatile compounds limonene, nerolidol, 2-heptanone and cis-3-hexenyl acetate dramatically increases larval tolerance to carbamate insecticide methomyl. Inhibition of P450s by piperonyl butoxide (PBO), a well-known P450 inhibitor, compromises the effects of volatile exposure. Exposure to the four volatiles upregulates multiple detoxification systems, including cytochrome P450s. Our findings indicate that induction of insecticide-detoxifying P450s by plant volatiles prior to actually inflicting plant damage may confer insect larvae more time to pre-activate insect detoxification systems prior to the ingestion or contact of insecticides, leading to increased larval tolerance to insecticides. Abstract Plants release an array of volatile chemicals into the air to communicate with other organisms in the environment. Insect attack triggers emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). How insect herbivores use these odors to plan their detoxification systems is vital for insect adaptation to environmental xenobiotics. Here we show that the larvae of Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), a broadly polyphagous lepidopteran herbivore, have the capacity to use plant volatiles as cues to upregulate multiple detoxification systems, including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), for detoxification of insecticides. Olfactory exposure of the fifth instars to two terpene volatiles limonene and nerolidol, and two green-leaf volatiles 2-heptanone and cis-3-hexenyl acetate significantly reduced larval susceptibility to the insecticide methomyl. However, larval pretreatment with piperonyl butoxide (PBO), a known P450 inhibitor, neutralized the effects of volatile exposure. Furthermore, larval exposure to the four plant volatiles enhanced activities of P450 enzymes in midguts and fatbodies, and upregulated expression of CYP6B2, CYP6B6 and CYP6B7, P450s involved in detoxification of the insecticide. Larval exposure to 2-heptanone and limonene volatiles also enhanced activities of glutathione-s-transferase and carboxylesterase. Our findings suggest that olfactory exposure to HIPVs enhances larval insecticide tolerance via induction of detoxification P450s. PMID:33808968},

	abstract = {Abstract Odorant receptors (ORs) are essential for plant–insect interactions. However, despite the global impacts of Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) as major herbivores and pollinators, little functional data are available about Lepidoptera ORs involved in plant-volatile detection. Here, we initially characterized the plant-volatile-sensing function(s) of 44 ORs from the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera, and subsequently conducted a large-scale comparative analysis that establishes how most orthologous ORs have functionally diverged among closely related species whereas some rare ORs are functionally conserved. Specifically, our systematic analysis of H. armigera ORs cataloged the wide functional scope of the H. armigera OR repertoire, and also showed that HarmOR42 and its Spodoptera littoralis ortholog are functionally conserved. Pursuing this, we characterized the HarmOR42-orthologous ORs from 11 species across the Glossata suborder and confirmed the HarmOR42 orthologs form a unique OR lineage that has undergone strong purifying selection in Glossata species and whose members are tuned with strong specificity to phenylacetaldehyde, a floral scent component common to most angiosperms. In vivo studies via HarmOR42 knockout support that HarmOR42-related ORs are essential for host-detection by sensing phenylacetaldehyde. Our work also supports that these ORs coevolved with the tube-like proboscis, and has maintained functional stability throughout the long-term coexistence of Lepidoptera with angiosperms. Thus, beyond providing a rich empirical resource for delineating the precise functions of H. armigera ORs, our results enable a comparative analysis of insect ORs that have apparently facilitated and currently sustain the intimate adaptations and ecological interactions among nectar feeding insects and flowering plants.

Here, we investigated aspects of the chemical and molecular basis of resistance against the exotic rust fungus Austropuccinia psidii in Melaleuca quinquenervia, with a focus on terpenes. Foliar terpenes of resistant and susceptible plants were quantified, and we assessed whether chemotypic variation contributed to resistance to infection by A. psidii. We found that chemotypes did not contribute to the resistance and susceptibility of M. quinquenervia. However, in one of the chemotypes (Chemotype 2), susceptible plants showed higher concentrations of several terpenes including α-pinene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, and viridiflorol compared with resistant plants. Transcriptome profiling of these plants showed that several TPS genes were strongly induced in response to infection by A. psidii. Functional characterization of these TPS showed them to be mono- and sesquiterpene synthases producing compounds including 1,8-cineole, β-caryophyllene, viridiflorol and nerolidol. The expression of these TPS genes correlated with metabolite data in a susceptible plant. These results suggest the complexity of resistance mechanism regulated by M. quinquenervia and that modulation of terpenes may be one of the components that contribute to resistance against A. psidii.},

	abstract = {Entomopathogenic fungi are gaining acceptance in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) systems as effective and environmental safety biological control agents to protect a great variety of crops against pest insects. Many of these insect-pathogenic fungi can establish themselves as endophytes and thereby may induce the plant immune system. The activation of plant defenses by the fungal endophytic colonization can have a direct impact on herbivores and plant pathogens. An integral component of many plant defense responses is also the release of volatile organic compounds, which may serve as an indirect defense by attracting the natural enemies of herbivores. Here we investigated the effect of endophytic colonization by the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana on the volatile emission by melon and cotton plants, either unharmed or after being damaged by sap-sucking aphids or leaf chewing caterpillars. We found that when the plants are colonized by B. bassiana they emit a different blend of volatile compounds compared to uncolonized control plants. Some of the emitted compounds have been reported previously to be released in response to herbivory and have been implicated in natural enemy attraction. Several of the compounds are also known to have antimicrobial properties. Therefore, endophytic colonization by B. bassiana might help to not only direct control insect pests but also increase the resistance of plants against agronomically important pests and phytopathogens.

	abstract = {In response to herbivore attack, plants release large amounts of volatiles that can serve as attractants for the natural enemies of the attacking herbivores. Such responses are typically triggered by damage- and insect-associated factors. Cotton plants are somewhat peculiar because they release specific blends of volatiles in two waves in response to caterpillar attack. They first emit constitutively stored volatile compounds, and after about 24 h a second wave that includes various de novo synthesized compounds. The relative importance of damage-associated and insect associated-factors in this induction of cotton volatile emissions is not yet fully clear. We evaluated how cotton plants respond to mechanical damage and to the application of the oral secretion from the generalist lepidopteran pest Spodoptera exigua, by measuring the local and systemic emissions of volatile compounds from their leaves. Our results confirm that cotton plants respond to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) as well as to herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) present in the caterpillars’ oral secretion. Interestingly, a stronger response was observed for cotton plants that were treated with oral secretion from cotton-fed caterpillars than those fed on maize. We tested the possibility that volicitin, a common fatty acid-derived elicitor in caterpillar regurgitant plays a role in this difference. Volicitin and volicitin-like compounds were detected in equal amounts in the oral secretion of S. exigua fed on either cotton or maize leaves. We conclude that other elicitors must be involved. The identification of these eliciting cues is expected to contribute to the development of novel strategies to enhance the resistance of cotton plants to insect pests. PMID:34413869},

	abstract = {Methyl salicylate (MeSA) is a volatile shown to act as an inducer of plant defense against pathogens and certain herbivores, particularly aphids. It has been shown to have potential for aphid pest management, but knowledge on its mode of action is lacking, particularly induced plant-mediated effects. This study investigated the effects of exposing plants to MeSA on the host searching, host acceptance and feeding behavior of the bird cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi. Barley plants were exposed to volatile MeSA for 24 h, after which biological effects were tested immediately after the exposure (Day 0), and then 1, 3 and 5 days after the end of the exposure. Aphid settling on MeSA-exposed plants was significantly reduced on days 0, 1 and 3, but not on day 5. In olfactometer tests, aphids preferred the odor of unexposed plants on days 1 and 3, but not on day 0 or 5. Analysis of volatiles from exposed and unexposed plants showed higher levels of MeSA from exposed plants, most likely absorbed and re-released from plant surfaces, but also specific changes in other plant volatiles on days 0, 1 and 3. High doses of MeSA did not affect aphid orientation in an olfactometer, but lower doses were repellent. Analysis of aphid feeding by Electronic penetration graph (EPG) showed that MeSA exposure resulted in resistance factors in barley plants, including surface factors and induced systemic factors in other tissues including the phloem. The results support the potential of MeSA as a potential tool for management of aphid pests. PMID:34484270},

An improved soil carbon budget serves the dual purpose of promoting soil health, which supports crop productivity, and constituting a pool from which carbon can be converted to recalcitrant forms for long-term storage as a mitigation measure for global warming. In this perspective, we propose the design of crop ideotypes with the dual functionality of being highly productive for the purposes of food, feed, and fuel, while at the same time being able to facilitate higher contribution to soil carbon and improve the below ground ecology. We advocate a holistic approach of the integrated plant-microbe-soil system and suggest that significant improvements in soil carbon storage can be achieved by a three-pronged approach: (1) design plants with an increased root strength to further allocation of carbon belowground; (2) balance the increase in belowground carbon allocation with increased source strength for enhanced photosynthesis and biomass accumulation; and (3) design soil microbial consortia for increased rhizosphere sink strength and plant growth-promoting (PGP) properties.},

	abstract = {The majority of insects rely on a highly complex and precise olfactory system to detect various volatile organic compounds released by host and non-host plants in environments. The odorant receptors (ORs) are considered to play an important role in odor recognition and the molecular basis of ORs, particularly in coleopterans they are relatively poorly understood. The red palm weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is one of the most destructive pests of the global palm industry. Although feeding and egg oviposition behaviors of RPW can be repelled by some non-palm plant volatiles, such as α-pinene, geraniol, or 1-octen-3-ol, there is limited understanding of how RPW recognizes the non-host plant volatiles. In this study, three candidate RferOrs were identified from the Rfer-specific clade, and the tissue expression analysis used was mainly expressed in the antennae of both sexes. Functional characterization of RferOr6, RferOr40, and RferOr87 was analyzed by using the Xenopus oocyte expression system, and the results indicated that RferOr6/RferOrco was narrowly tuned to α-pinene. The behavioral experiment showed that α-pinene at the concentrations of 10 and 100 μg/μl can cause a significantly repelled behavioral response of RPW. In conclusion, this study reveals that RferOr6 is an antenna-biased expressed OR used by RPW to detect the volatile compound α-pinene in non-palm plants, and our results provide a foundation for further in vivo functional studies of Or6 in RPW, including in vivo knockout/knockdown and feeding/ovipositing behavioral studies of RPW and further pest control.

	abstract = {Simple Summary Some species of insect herbivores can feed on a wide variety of plant species. Over evolutionary time, insect herbivores can associate preferentially with different host-plant species, which frequently leads to genetic divergence between populations of an herbivore species. This phenomenon, referred to as host-associated differentiation (HAD), not only affects insect herbivores, but can also impact their associated natural enemies, particularly predatory or parasitic insects, which are responsible for biological control in agroecosystems. Although the mechanisms underlying HAD in populations of herbivores and associated natural enemies remain underexplored, we argue that the chemical communication between plants, herbivores, and natural enemies likely plays a major role. Chemical cues emitted by plants and insect herbivores influence natural enemy foraging behavior, and divergent chemical cues can lead to natural enemy HAD, ultimately shaping biological control. In this synthesis paper, we explore how the chemical ecology of HAD could influence classical, conservation, and augmentative biological control, and propose research agendas to further biological control efficacy through natural enemy selection. Abstract Host-associated differentiation (HAD) refers to cases in which genetically distinct populations of a species (e.g., herbivores or natural enemies) preferentially reproduce or feed on different host species. In agroecosystems, HAD often results in unique strains or biotypes of pest species, each attacking different species of crops. However, HAD is not restricted to pest populations, and may cascade to the third trophic level, affecting host selection by natural enemies, and ultimately leading to HAD within natural enemy species. Natural enemy HAD may affect the outcomes of biological control efforts, whether classical, conservation, or augmentative. Here, we explore the potential effects of pest and natural enemy HAD on biological control in agroecosystems, with emphases on current knowledge gaps and implications of HAD for selection of biological control agents. Additionally, given the importance of semiochemicals in mediating interactions between trophic levels, we emphasize the role of chemical ecology in interactions between pests and natural enemies, and suggest areas of consideration for biological control. Overall, we aim to jump-start a conversation concerning the relevance of HAD in biological control by reviewing currently available information on natural enemy HAD, identifying challenges to incorporating HAD considerations into biological control efforts, and proposing future research directions on natural enemy selection and HAD.

	abstract = {Simple Summary Odorant receptors (ORs) are at the core of the high-efficiency and sensitive olfactory system in insects. The expression and specific function of ORs largely contribute to the habits and speciation of one species. Although being predominantly expressed in the antennae, ORs in non-olfactory organs are suggested to have particular roles in promoting the reproduction or host fitness of insects. Our previous work has identified four ORs in the mouthpart organs of Helicoverpa armigera. Here, we amplified the full-length sequences of HarmORs from the proboscis. Further functional characterization suggested that HarmOR30 narrowly tuned to indole, the vital nitrogen-containing compounds that mediate tritrophic interactions. Our study deepens the insight into the olfactory perception of H. armigera, and explored a candidate functional receptor target for studying the interaction between insects and their plant hosts. Abstract Helicoverpa armigera is a serious agricultural pest with polyphagous diets, widespread distribution, and causing severe damage. Among sixty-five candidate ORs in H. armigera, the co-receptor HarmOrco and three specific ORs with partial sequences were identified to be expressed in the proboscis by our previous work, whereas their exact function is not known yet. In this study, we first confirmed the expression of these ORs in the proboscis by full-length cloning, which obtained the complete coding region of HarmOrco, OR24, and OR30. We then performed functional identification of HarmOR24 and OR30 by co-expressing them respectively with HarmOrco in Xenopus oocytes eukaryotic expression system combined with two-electrode voltage-clamp physiology. By testing the response of HarmOR24/OR30-expressing oocytes against eighty structural-divergent compounds, respectively, HarmOR30 was characterized to narrowly tune to indole and showed a specific tuning spectrum compared to its ortholog in Spodoptera littoralis. As indole is a distinctive herbivore-induced plant volatile and floral scent component, HarmOR30 might play roles in foraging and mediating the interactions between H. armigera with its surrounding environment.

	abstract = {Plants are able to respond to herbivore damage with de novo biosynthesis of an herbivore-characteristic blend of volatiles. The signal transduction initiating volatile biosynthesis may involve the activation of the octadecanoid pathway, as exemplified by the transient increase of endogenous jasmonic acid (JA) in leaves of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) after treatment with the macromolecular elicitor cellulysin. Within this pathway lima bean possesses at least two different biologically active signals that trigger different biosynthetic activities. Early intermediates of the pathway, especially 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (PDA), are able to induce the biosynthesis of the diterpenoid-derived 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene. High concentrations of PDA result in more complex patterns of additional volatiles. JA, the last compound in the sequence, lacks the ability to induce diterpenoid-derived compounds, but is highly effective at triggering the biosynthesis of other volatiles. The phytotoxin coronatine and amino acid conjugates of linolenic acid (e.g. linolenoyl-l-glutamine) mimic the action of PDA, but coronatine does not increase the level of endogenous JA. The structural analog of coronatine, the isoleucine conjugate of 1-oxo-indanoyl-4-carboxylic acid, effectively mimics the action of JA, but does not increase the level of endogenous JA. The differential induction of volatiles resembles previous findings on signal transduction in mechanically stimulated tendrils of Bryonia dioica. PMID:10482670},

The neuronal network, which reformats the input from antenna neurons in the brain, did not improve pheromone salience. We postulate that moth olfactory system evolved to increase sensitivity and encode fast changes of concentration at some cost for signal extraction.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The galling insect manipulates the host plant tissue to its own benefit, building the gall structure where it spends during most of its life cycle. These specialist herbivore insects can induce and manipulate plant structure and metabolism throughout gall development and may affect plant volatile emission. Consequently, volatile emission from altered metabolism contribute to eavesdropping cueing. Eavesdropping can be part of adaptive strategies used by evolution for both galling insects and the entire-associated community in order to cue some interaction response. This is in contrast to some herbivores associated with delayed induced responses, altering plant metabolites during the short time while they feed. Due to the different lifestyles of the galling organism, which are associated with different plant tissues and organs (e.g leaves, flowers or fruits), a distinct diversity of organisms may eavesdrop on induced volatiles interacting with the galls. Furthermore, the eavesdropping cues may be defined according to the phenological coupling between galling organism and host plant, which results from the development of a gall structure. For instance, when plants release volatile-induced defenses after galling insects’ activity, another interactor may perceive these volatiles and change its behavior and interactions with host plants and galls. Thus, natural enemies could be attracted by different volatiles emitted by the gall tissues. Considering the duration of the life cycle of the galling organism and the gall, the temporal extent of gall-induced volatiles may include more persistent volatile cues and eavesdropping effects than the volatiles induced by non-galling herbivores. Accordingly, from chemical ecology perspective we expect that galling herbivore-induced volatiles may exhibit robust effects on neighboring-plant interactions including those ones during different plant developmental or phenological periods. Information about multitrophic interactions between insects and plants supports the additional understanding of direct and indirect effects, and allows insight into new hypotheses. PMID:31538533},

Routine monitoring for radiation and radioactive or chemical substances was conducted on the Laboratory site and in the surrounding region to determine compliance with appropriate standards and permit early identification of possible undesirable trends. Results and interpretation of the data for 1979 on penetrating radiation, chemical and radiochemical quality of ambient air, surface and ground water, municipal water supply, soils and sediments, food, and airborne and liquid effluents are included. Comparisons with appropriate standards and regulations or with background levels from natural or other non-LASL sources provide a basis for concluding that environmental effects attributable to LASL operations are minor and cannot be considered likely to result in any hazard to the population of the area. Results of several special studies provide documentation of some unique environmental conditions in the LASL environs.},

E,H and S concerns affecting the achievement of National PV Program goals or the viability of specific PV technologies are emphasized. The report is limited to near-term manufacturing process alternatives for crystalline silicon PV materials, addresses flat-plate and concentrator collector designs, and reviews system deployment in grid-connected, roof-mounted, residential and ground-mounted central-station applications. The PV life-cycle phases examined include silicon refinement and manufacture of PV collectors, system deployment, and decommissioning. The primary E,H and S concerns that arise during collector fabrication are associated with occupational exposure to materials of undetermined toxicity or to materials that are known to be hazardous, but for which process control technology may be inadequate. Stricter exposure standards are anticipated for some materials and may indicate a need for further control technology development. Minimizing electric shock hazards is a significant concern during system construction, operation and maintenance, and decommissioning.},

Each faculty fellow spent at least 10 weeks at JSC engaged in a research project in collaboration with a NASA/JSC colleague. In addition to the faculty participants, the 1995 program included five students. This document is a compilation of the first fifteen of twenty-seven final reports on the research projects completed by the faculty fellows and visiting students during the summer of 1995. The reports of two of the students are integral with that of the respective fellow. Three students wrote separate reports included in Volume 2.},

We propose to continue controlling undesirable vegetation using a program of Integrated Vegetation Management (IVM) which includes manual, biological and chemical treatment methods. BPA has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) (DOE/EA-1257) evaluating the proposed project. Based on the analysis in the EA, BPA has determined that the proposed action is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969. Therefore, the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is not required and BPA is issuing this FONSI.},

	abstract = {Bonneville is responsible for maintaining a network of 24,000 kilometers (km) or 15,000 miles (mi.) of electric transmission lines and 350 substations in a region of diverse vegetation. This vegetation can interfere with electric power flow, pose safety problems for us and the public, and interfere with our ability to maintain these facilities. We need to (1) keep vegetation away from our electric facilities; (2) increase our program efficiency and consistency; (3) review herbicide use (under increased public scrutiny); and (4) maximize the range of tools we can use while minimizing environmental impact (Integrated Vegetation Management). This Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) establishes Planning Steps for managing vegetation for specific projects (to be tiered to this Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)). In addition to No Action (current practice), alternatives are presented for Rights-of-way, Electric Yards, and Non-electric Facilities (landscaping, work yards). Four vegetation control methods are analyzed manual, mechanical, herbicide, and biological. Also evaluated are 23 herbicide active ingredients and 4 herbicide application techniques (spot, localized, broadcast, and aerial). For rights-of-way, we consider three sets of alternatives: alternative management approaches (time-driven or establishing low-growing plant communities); alternative method packages; and, if herbicides are in a methods package, alternative vegetation selections (noxious weeds, deciduous, or any vegetation). For electric yards, one herbicide-use alternative is considered. For non-electric facilities, two method package alternatives are considered. For rights-of-way, the environmentally preferred alternative(s) would use manual, mechanical, and biological control methods, as well as spot and localized herbicide applications for noxious and deciduous plant species; the BPA-preferred alternative(s) would add broadcast and aerial herbicide applications, and would use herbicides on any vegetation. Both would favor a management approach that fosters low-growing plant communities.},

	abstract = {Maize (Zea mays) emits a mixture of volatile compounds upon attack by the Egyptian cotton leafworm (Spodoptera littoralis). These substances, primarily mono- and sesquiterpenes, are used by parasitic wasps to locate the lepidopteran larvae, which are their natural hosts. This interaction among plant, lepidopteran larvae, and hymenopteran parasitoids benefits the plant and has been termed indirect defense. The committed step in the biosynthesis of the different skeletal types of mono- and sesquiterpenes is catalyzed by terpene synthases, a class of enzymes that forms a large variety of mono- and sesquiterpene products from prenyl diphosphate precursors. We isolated a terpene synthase gene, terpene synthase 1 (tps1), from maize that exhibits only a low degree of sequence identity to previously identified terpene synthases. Upon expression in a bacterial system, the encoded enzyme produced the acyclic sesquiterpenes, (E)-β-farnesene, (E,E)-farnesol, and (3R)-(E)-nerolidol, the last an intermediate in the formation of (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene. Both (E)-β-farnesene and (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene are prominent compounds of the maize volatile blend that is emitted after herbivore damage. The biochemical characteristics of the encoded enzyme are similar to those of terpene synthases from both gymnosperms and dicotyledonous angiosperms, suggesting that catalysis involves a similar electrophilic reaction mechanism. The transcript level of tps1 in the maize cv B73 was elevated after herbivory, mechanical damage, and treatment with elicitors. In contrast, the increase in the transcript level of the tps1 gene or gene homolog in the maize cv Delprim after herbivory was less pronounced, suggesting that the regulation of terpene synthase expression may vary among maize varieties.

	abstract = {Background Plant volatiles play an important role in defending plants against insect attacks by attracting their natural enemies. For example, green leaf volatiles (GLVs) and terpenoids emitted from herbivore-damaged plants were found to be important in the host location of parasitic wasps. However, evidence of the functional roles and mechanisms of these semio-chemicals from a system of multiple plants in prey location by the parasitoid is limited. Little is known about the potential evolutionary trends between herbivore-induced host plant volatiles and the host location of their parasitoids. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study includes hierarchical cluster analyses of plant volatile profiles from seven families of host and non-host plants of pea leafminer, Liriomyza huidobrensis, and behavioral responses of a naive parasitic wasp, Opius dissitus, to some principal volatile compounds. Here we show that plants can effectively pull wasps, O. dissitus, towards them by releasing a universally induced compound, (Z)-3-hexenol, and potentially keep these plants safe from parasitic assaults by leafminer pests, L. huidobrensis. Specifically, we found that volatile profiles from healthy plants revealed a partly phylogenetic signal, while the inducible compounds of the infested-plants did not result from the fact that the induced plant volatiles dominate most of the volatile blends of the host and non-host plants of the leafminer pests. We further show that the parasitoids are capable of distinguishing the damaged host plant from the non-host plant of the leafminers. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that, as the most passive scenario of plant involvement, leafminers and mechanical damages evoke similar semio-chemicals. Using ubiquitous compounds, such as hexenol, for host location by general parasitoids could be an adaptation of the most conservative evolution of tritrophic interaction. Although for this, other compounds may be used to improve the precision of the host location by the parasitoids. PMID:17786223},

	abstract = {Continuous mechanical damage initiates the rhythmic emission of volatiles in lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) leaves; the emission resembles that induced by herbivore damage. The effect of diurnal versus nocturnal damage on the initiation of plant defense responses was investigated using MecWorm, a robotic device designed to reproduce tissue damage caused by herbivore attack. Lima bean leaves that were damaged by MecWorm during the photophase emitted maximal levels of β-ocimene and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate in the late photophase. Leaves damaged during the dark phase responded with the nocturnal emission of (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, but with only low amounts of β-ocimene; this emission was followed by an emission burst directly after the onset of light. In the presence of 13CO2, this light-dependent synthesis of β-ocimene resulted in incorporation of 75\% to 85\% of 13C, demonstrating that biosynthesis of β-ocimene is almost exclusively fueled by the photosynthetic fixation of CO2 along the plastidial 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-P pathway. Jasmonic acid (JA) accumulated locally in direct response to the damage and led to immediate up-regulation of the P. lunatus β-ocimene synthase gene (PlOS) independent of the phase, that is, light or dark. Nocturnal damage caused significantly higher concentrations of JA (approximately 2–3 times) along with enhanced expression levels of PlOS. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana transformed with PlOS promoter∷β-glucuronidase fusion constructs confirmed expression of the enzyme at the wounded sites. In summary, damage-dependent JA levels directly control the expression level of PlOS, regardless of light or dark conditions, and photosynthesis is the major source for the early precursors of the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-P pathway.

	abstract = {It is of adaptive value for a plant to prepare its defenses when a threat is detected, and certain plant volatiles associated with insect damage, such as cis-jasmone (CJ), are known to switch-on defense metabolism. We used aphid and aphid parasitoid responses to Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system for studying gene expression and defense chemistry and its impact at different trophic levels. Differential responses to volatiles of induced Arabidopsis occurred for specialist and generalist insects: the generalist aphid, Myzus persicae, was repelled, whereas the specialist, Lipaphis erysimi, was attracted; the generalist aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi was attracted, but the specialist parasitoid Diaeretiella rapae was not affected. A. ervi also spent longer foraging on induced plants than on untreated ones. Transcriptomic analyses of CJ-induced Arabidopsis plants revealed that a limited number of genes, including a gene for a cytochrome P450, CYP81D11, were strongly up-regulated in the treated plants. We examined transgenic Arabidopsis lines constitutively overexpressing this gene in bioassays and found insect responses similar to those obtained for wild-type plants induced with CJ, indicating the importance of this gene in the CJ-activated defense response. Genes involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis and catabolism are unaffected by CJ and, because these genes relate to interactions with herbivores and parasitoids specific to this family of plants (Brassicaceae), this finding may explain the differences in behavioral response of specialist and generalist insects.

	abstract = {The induction of plant defences involves a sequence of steps along a signal transduction pathway, varying in time course. In this study, the effects of induction of an early and a later step in plant defence signal transduction on plant volatile emission and parasitoid attraction are compared. Ion channel-forming peptides represent a class of inducers that induce an early step in signal transduction. Alamethicin (ALA) is an ion channel-forming peptide mixture from the fungus Trichoderma viride that can induce volatile emission and increase endogenous levels of jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid in plants. ALA was used to induce an early step in the defence response in Brussels sprouts plants, Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera, and to study the effect on volatile emission and on the behavioural response of parasitoids to volatile emission. The parasitoid Cotesia glomerata was attracted to ALA-treated plants in a dose-dependent manner. JA, produced through the octadecanoid pathway, activates a later step in induced plant defence signal transduction, and JA also induces volatiles that are attractive to parasitoids. Treatment with ALA and JA resulted in distinct volatile blends, and both blends differed from the volatile blends emitted by control plants. Even though JA treatment of Brussels sprouts plants resulted in higher levels of volatile emission, ALA-treated plants were as attractive to C. glomerata as JA-treated plants. This demonstrates that on a molar basis, ALA is a 20 times more potent inducer of indirect plant defence than JA, although this hormone has more commonly been used as a chemical inducer of plant defence.

	abstract = {When attacked by insects, plants release mixtures of volatile compounds that are beneficial for direct or indirect defense. Natural variation of volatile emissions frequently occurs between and within plant species, but knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms is limited. We investigated intraspecific differences of volatile emissions induced from rosette leaves of 27 accessions of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) upon treatment with coronalon, a jasmonate mimic eliciting responses similar to those caused by insect feeding. Quantitative variation was found for the emission of the monoterpene (E)-β-ocimene, the sesquiterpene (E,E)-α-farnesene, the irregular homoterpene 4,8,12-trimethyltridecatetra-1,3,7,11-ene, and the benzenoid compound methyl salicylate. Differences in the relative emissions of (E)-β-ocimene and (E,E)-α-farnesene from accession Wassilewskija (Ws), a high-(E)-β-ocimene emitter, and accession Columbia (Col-0), a trace-(E)-β-ocimene emitter, were attributed to allelic variation of two closely related, tandem-duplicated terpene synthase genes, TPS02 and TPS03. The Ws genome contains a functional allele of TPS02 but not of TPS03, while the opposite is the case for Col-0. Recombinant proteins of the functional Ws TPS02 and Col-0 TPS03 genes both showed (E)-β-ocimene and (E,E)-α-farnesene synthase activities. However, differential subcellular compartmentalization of the two enzymes in plastids and the cytosol was found to be responsible for the ecotype-specific differences in (E)-β-ocimene/(E,E)-α-farnesene emission. Expression of the functional TPS02 and TPS03 alleles is induced in leaves by elicitor and insect treatment and occurs constitutively in floral tissues. Our studies show that both pseudogenization in the TPS family and subcellular segregation of functional TPS enzymes control the variation and plasticity of induced volatile emissions in wild plant species.

	abstract = {Volatile methyl esters are common constituents of plant volatiles with important functions in plant defense. To study the biosynthesis of these compounds, especially methyl anthranilate and methyl salicylate, we identified a group of methyltransferases that are members of the SABATH enzyme family in maize (Zea mays). In vitro biochemical characterization after bacterial expression revealed three S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferases with high specificity for anthranilic acid as a substrate. Of these three proteins, Anthranilic Acid Methyltransferase1 (AAMT1) appears to be responsible for most of the S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase activity and methyl anthranilate formation observed in maize after herbivore damage. The enzymes may also be involved in the formation of low amounts of methyl salicylate, which are emitted from herbivore-damaged maize. Homology-based structural modeling combined with site-directed mutagenesis identified two amino acid residues, designated tyrosine-246 and glutamine-167 in AAMT1, which are responsible for the high specificity of AAMTs toward anthranilic acid. These residues are conserved in each of the three main clades of the SABATH family, indicating that the carboxyl methyltransferases are functionally separated by these clades. In maize, this gene family has diversified especially toward benzenoid carboxyl methyltransferases that accept anthranilic acid and benzoic acid. PMID:20519632},

	abstract = {Background Volatiles emitted by herbivore-infested plants are highly attractive to parasitoids and therefore have been proposed to be part of an indirect plant defense strategy. However, this proposed function of the plant-provided signals remains controversial, and it is unclear how specific and reliable the signals are under natural conditions with simultaneous feeding by multiple herbivores. Phloem feeders in particular are assumed to interfere with plant defense responses. Therefore, we investigated how attack by the piercing-sucking cicadellid Euscelidius variegatus influences signaling by maize plants in response to the chewing herbivore Spodoptera littoralis. Results The parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris strongly preferred volatiles of plants infested with its host S. littoralis. Overall, the volatile emissions induced by S. littoralis and E. variegatus were similar, but higher levels of certain wound-released compounds may have allowed the wasps to specifically recognize plants infested by hosts. Expression levels of defense marker genes and further behavioral bioassays with the parasitoid showed that neither the physiological defense responses nor the attractiveness of S. littoralis infested plants were altered by simultaneous E. variegatus attack. Conclusions Our findings imply that plant defense responses to herbivory can be more robust than generally assumed and that ensuing volatiles convey specific information about the type of herbivore that is attacking a plant, even in complex situations with multiple herbivores. Hence, the results of this study support the notion that herbivore-induced plant volatiles may be part of a plant's indirect defense stratagem. PMID:21078181},

	abstract = {Background Odorant-Degrading Enzymes (ODEs) are supposed to be involved in the signal inactivation step within the olfactory sensilla of insects by quickly removing odorant molecules from the vicinity of the olfactory receptors. Only three ODEs have been both identified at the molecular level and functionally characterized: two were specialized in the degradation of pheromone compounds and the last one was shown to degrade a plant odorant. Methodology Previous work has shown that the antennae of the cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis, a worldwide pest of agricultural crops, express numerous candidate ODEs. We focused on an esterase overexpressed in males antennae, namely SlCXE7. We studied its expression patterns and tested its catalytic properties towards three odorants, i.e. the two female sex pheromone components and a green leaf volatile emitted by host plants. Conclusion SlCXE7 expression was concomitant during development with male responsiveness to odorants and during adult scotophase with the period of male most active sexual behaviour. Furthermore, SlCXE7 transcription could be induced by male exposure to the main pheromone component, suggesting a role of Pheromone-Degrading Enzyme. Interestingly, recombinant SlCXE7 was able to efficiently hydrolyze the pheromone compounds but also the plant volatile, with a higher affinity for the pheromone than for the plant compound. In male antennae, SlCXE7 expression was associated with both long and short sensilla, tuned to sex pheromones or plant odours, respectively. Our results thus suggested that a same ODE could have a dual function depending of it sensillar localisation. Within the pheromone-sensitive sensilla, SlCXE7 may play a role in pheromone signal termination and in reduction of odorant background noise, whereas it could be involved in plant odorant inactivation within the short sensilla.

	abstract = {Mating induces profound physiological changes in a wide range of insects, leading to behavioural adjustments to match the internal state of the animal. Here, we show for the first time, to our knowledge, that a noctuid moth switches its olfactory response from food to egg-laying cues following mating. Unmated females of the cotton leafworm (Spodoptera littoralis) are strongly attracted to lilac flowers (Syringa vulgaris). After mating, attraction to floral odour is abolished and the females fly instead to green-leaf odour of the larval host plant cotton, Gossypium hirsutum. This behavioural switch is owing to a marked change in the olfactory representation of floral and green odours in the primary olfactory centre, the antennal lobe (AL). Calcium imaging, using authentic and synthetic odours, shows that the ensemble of AL glomeruli dedicated to either lilac or cotton odour is selectively up- and downregulated in response to mating. A clear-cut behavioural modulation as a function of mating is a useful substrate for studies of the neural mechanisms underlying behavioural decisions. Modulation of odour-driven behaviour through concerted regulation of odour maps contributes to our understanding of state-dependent choice and host shifts in insect herbivores. PMID:22319127},

	abstract = {Indirect plant defenses are those facilitating the action of carnivores in ridding plants of their herbivorous consumers, as opposed to directly poisoning or repelling them. Of the numerous and diverse indirect defensive strategies employed by plants, inducible volatile production has garnered the most fascination among plant-insect ecologists. These volatile chemicals are emitted in response to feeding by herbivorous arthropods and serve to guide predators and parasitic wasps to their prey. Implicit in virtually all discussions of plant volatile-carnivore interactions is the premise that plants “call for help” to bodyguards that serve to boost plant fitness by limiting herbivore damage. This, by necessity, assumes a three-trophic level food chain where carnivores benefit plants, a theoretical framework that is conceptually tractable and convenient, but poorly depicts the complexity of food-web dynamics occurring in real communities. Recent work suggests that hyperparasitoids, top consumers acting from the fourth trophic level, exploit the same plant volatile cues used by third trophic level carnivores. Further, hyperparasitoids shift their foraging preferences, specifically cueing in to the odor profile of a plant being damaged by a parasitized herbivore that contains their host compared with damage from an unparasitized herbivore. If this outcome is broadly representative of plant-insect food webs at large, it suggests that damage-induced volatiles may not always be beneficial to plants with major implications for the evolution of anti-herbivore defense and manipulating plant traits to improve biological control in agricultural crops.

A major focus of the lab is on WNT signaling, a fundamental pathway that orchestrates embryonic patterning and morphogenesis, promotes stem cell self-renewal and tissue regeneration, and can be a potent cancer driver when it becomes dysregulated. We use powerful genetic screens in human cells to discover new regulatory mechanisms and probe their molecular underpinning through biochemistry and cell biology. We seek to unravel how this new regulation determines physiological outcomes using organoid cultures and animal models.

	abstract = {The Department of Energy (DOE) has implemented programs for encouraging the development and commercialization of coal-related technologies, which include coal gasification demonstration-scale activities. In support of commercialization activities the Environmental Analysis for Pipeline Gas Demonstration Plants has been prepared as a reference document to be used in evaluating potential environmental and socioeconomic effects from construction and operation of site- and process-specific projects. Effluents and associated impacts are identified for six coal gasification processes at three contrasting settings. In general, impacts from construction of a high-Btu gas demonstration plant are similar to those caused by the construction of any chemical plant of similar size. The operation of a high-Btu gas demonstration plant, however, has several unique aspects that differentiate it from other chemical plants. Offsite development (surface mining) and disposal of large quantities of waste solids constitute important sources of potential impact. In addition, air emissions require monitoring for trace metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, and other emissions. Potential biological impacts from long-term exposure to these emissions are unknown, and additional research and data analysis may be necessary to determine such effects. Possible effects of pollutants on vegetation and human populations are discussed. The occurrence of chemical contaminants in liquid effluents and the bioaccumulation of these contaminants in aquatic organisms may lead to adverse ecological impact. Socioeconomic impacts are similar to those from a chemical plant of equivalent size and are summarized and contrasted for the three surrogate sites.},

The understanding of pheromone production has evolved from identifying biochemical pathways towards unraveling the molecular biology of key regulatory enzymes. In one system, a genomics approach is initiated. The understanding of the regulation of pheromone production has advanced from simply knowing that a particular hormone increased pheromone production in a few species to developing an understanding of which enzymes are regulated at the molecular level. The understanding of pheromone reception had undergone dramatic change with the proposal that pheromone binding proteins (PBPs) and pheromone degrading enzymes transported and inactivated pheromonal signals within the sensilla. The general framework of this process is known to be widespread for most insects and for the reception of pheromones, plant volatiles, and other odorants. Biochemical transduction pathways are identified including the important olfactory receptor proteins. A marriage of molecular genetics and genomics with biomechanics, behavior, anatomy, and physiology is giving new understanding of how pheromones are detected.},

	abstract = {The meadow moth Loxostege sticticalis is a serious agricultural pest that feeds on the leaves of many economic crops, such as sugar beet, soybean, sunflower, and potato. In addition to the rapid migration of adult moths, the collective foraging behavior of the larvae is also thought to be involved in the search for new food sources and substantially contributes to the expansion of the infested area. However, whether and how the chemical signals take part in this process remains unknown. In this study, two larva-specific expressed odorants, LstiOR5 and LstiOR6, were successfully cloned and deophanized. A heterologous study on Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that several host plant volatiles could evoke LstiOR responses in a dose-dependent manner. One herbivore-induced plant volatile (HIPV) of soybean leaves, methyl salicylate (MeSA), exerted attractive effects on the L. sticticalis larvae at all tested concentrations. Further foraging choice assays showed that the L. sticticalis larvae preferred foraged soybean leaves over unforaged leaves. When MeSA was artificially added to unforaged leaves, the unforaged leaves were preferred over the foraged leaves. In addition, GC-MS analysis demonstrated that MeSA was induced by the foraging behavior of the larvae and acted as a collective food signal in L. sticticalis. Moreover, in situ hybridization showed that LstiOR5 was highly expressed in larval antenna neurons. When LstiOR5 was silenced, both the electrophysiological response of the antenna to MeSA and the preference for foraged leaves were significantly decreased, suggesting that LstiOR5 is involved in the collective foraging behavior of L. sticticalis. Our results clarified the chemical signals that trigger the collective foraging behavior of L. sticticalis and provided more evidence for the molecular mechanism underlying the expansions of their infested areas at a peripheral olfactory sensing level. These findings could facilitate the development of potential control strategies for controlling this pest and provide a potential gene target that correlates with the collective foraging behavior of L. sticticalis, which might lead to better pest management.},

	abstract = {The Xenopus oocyte and the Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cell expression systems are frequently used for functional characterization (deorphanization) of insect odorant receptors (ORs). However, the inherent characteristics of these heterologous systems differ in several aspects, which raises the question of whether the two systems provide comparable results, and how well the results correspond to the responses obtained from olfactory sensory neurons in vivo. Five candidate pheromone receptors were previously identified in the primitive moth Eriocrania semipurpurella (Esem) and their responses were characterized in HEK cells. We re-examined the responses of these five EsemORs in Xenopus oocytes. We showed that in both systems, EsemOR1 specifically responded to the plant volatile β-caryophyllene. EsemOR3 responded stronger to the pheromone component (S,Z)-6-nonen-2-ol than to its enantiomer (R,Z)-6-nonen-2-ol, the second pheromone component. However, EsemOR3 also responded secondarily to the plant volatile β-caryophyllene in the oocyte system, but not in the HEK cell system. EsemOR4 was unresponsive in the HEK cells, but responded primarily to (R,Z)-6-nonen-2-ol followed by (S,Z)-6-nonen-2-ol in the oocytes, representing a discovery of a new pheromone receptor in this species. EsemOR5 was broadly tuned in both systems, but the rank order among the most active pheromone compounds and antagonists was different. EsemOR6 showed no response to any compound in either system. We compared the results obtained in the two different heterologous systems with the activity previously recorded in vivo, and performed in situ hybridization to localize the expression of these OR genes in the antennae. In spite of similar results overall, differences in OR responses between heterologous expression systems suggest that conclusions about the function of individual ORs may differ depending on the system used for deorphanization.},

Basic results on the existence, uniqueness, non-negativity and boundedness of the solutions, local and global stability of coexistence equilibrium points and limit cycles emerging through Hopf bifurcation are investigated. Stability behavior around coexistence equilibrium point changes with varying fractional order (α). Also the existence of Hopf bifurcation is established by considering the fractional order α as a bifurcation parameter. Moreover, the attraction factor of plant volatile to carnivore and predation rate for plant-herbivore are responsible for changing the system dynamics. Numerical simulations using matlab software are performed to support the analytical findings.},

	abstract = {Insect alarm pheromones are chemical substances that are synthesized and released in response to predators to reduce predation risk. Alarm pheromones can also be perceived by predators, who take advantage of alarm cues to locate prey. While selection favors evolution of alarm pheromone signals that are not easily detectable by predators, predator evolution selects for better prey detection ability. Here, we review the diversity of alarm signals, and consider the behavioral and ecological conditions under which they have evolved. We show that components of alarm pheromones are similar across many insects, although aphids exhibit different behavioral responses to alarm cues compared to social insects. The effects of alarm pheromones on prey behavior depend on factors such as the concentration of pheromones and the density of conspecifics. We also discuss the molecular mechanisms of alarm pheromone perception underlying the evolutionary arms race between predators and prey, and the function of olfactory proteins and receptors in particular. Our review provides a novel synthesis of the diversity and function of insect alarm pheromones, while suggesting avenues that might better allow researchers to exploit population-level responses to alarm signaling for the sustainable management of pests and vector-borne pathogens.},

	abstract = {Plants respond adaptively to herbivore stress in order to maintain fitness. Upon herbivore attack, plants emit blends of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that differ from those that are constitutively emitted. These defense responses are typically specific to the identity of the attacking herbivore and often linked to the herbivore's feeding guild (e.g. chewing, phloem-feeding). Herbivores use plant volatiles to locate suitable host plants and changes in volatile emissions can affect host-plant location. Therefore, herbivores from separate feeding guilds can interact indirectly through the modulation of plant responses. In this study we tested how damage by an herbivore from one feeding guild affected the host-plant choice of an herbivore from a separate feeding guild, and vice versa. A chewing herbivore, the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), and a phloem feeding herbivore, the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), were assayed in olfactometers to assess behavioral responses to odors emitted by potato plants (Solanum tuberosum) that were damaged by herbivores from the other feeding guild. Leptinotarsa decemlineata oriented more frequently towards undamaged plants compared to M. persicae damaged plants. Surprisingly, M. persicae preferred plants that were damaged by L. decemlineata, although previous studies had shown that they perform worse on these plants. Distinct differences were detected in the volatile profiles of herbivore-damaged and undamaged plants. Leptinotarsa decemlineata induced stronger volatile emissions compared to undamaged control plants, while M. persicae tended to suppress volatile emissions. These herbivores demonstrate contrasting induction of plant volatiles and behavioral responses. Exploring the nature of co-occurring herbivores and how they perceive potential hosts can play a significant role in understanding the ecological functions and community dynamics of plant plasticity and interactions with a variety of herbivores.},

In this study, two different methods were used to investigate the effect of plant volatiles and P. neoaphidis-sporulating cadavers on (1) the colonisation of Vicia faba plants by Acyrthosiphon pisum and (2) P. neoaphidis transmission. This study indicates that A. pisum does not avoid bean plants containing P. neoaphidis and that transmission of conidia occurs during plant colonisation and, to a lesser extent, during in situ feeding.

Natural enemies often utilize the volatiles that released from plants to locate the profitable patches for foraging. The lady beetle Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) is a dominant generalist predator of various pests in agriculture fields, yet little is known about the chemical cues which the predator employs to locate its prey. In this study, we tested the attractiveness of volatiles emanating from healthy and aphid-infested insectary plant Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cuss. to H. axyridis adults in a Y-tube olfactometer. Next, using coupled gas chromatography – electroantennogram detection (GC-EAD) and gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (GC–MS) identified the volatile components which elicited electrophysiological activity in H. axyridis adults. Lastly, Y-tube olfactometer tests in laboratory and field traps were used to verify the effectiveness of the volatile components. In olfactometer trials, H. axyridis adults preferred healthy and aphid-infested plants versus control. In GC–MS and GC-EAD trials, two antenna-active components (1,2-diethylbenzene and p-diethylbenzene) were detected among the volatile blends emanating from healthy and aphid-infested plants; and in ensuing behavioral assays, H. axyridis adults were attracted to two synthetic volatile compounds. Under field conditions, the number of H. axyridis adults as recorded in traps for two synthetic volatile components at three different concentrations (100 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, and 1 mg/ml) were significantly higher than those for mineral oil (control). These findings could provide an effective means for the cultivation of insectary plants to develop natural enemy attractants and support the biological control in the field.},

Multi-unit electrophysiological recordings from olfactory nerves of adults indicated that strong responses were reliably elicited by volatiles from six plant species. After pairings of plant volatiles with gastro-intestinal malaise, birds exhibited conditioned avoidance in behavioural experiments, and made all possible pairwise discriminations between volatiles of the various plant species. Bilateral olfactory nerve cuts prior to conditioning abolished the ability to acquire avoidance, suggesting that olfactory cues mediated the response to plant species.

In the present study, we aim to identify volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that may act as semiochemicals for these species. Using the dynamic headspace technique, we collected VOCs from Olea europaea L. and Polygala myrtifolia L., highly susceptible plant species to X. fastidiosa, Pinus halepensis Mill., a common plant where N. campestris is found during summer, and from host plant species that are used as cover crops or exist as natural vegetation in olive orchards, such as Cistus creticus L., Medicago sativa L., Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers., Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh., Apium graveolens L. and Petroselinum crispum (Mill.) Fuss. We tested the response of female antennae on those blends with Gas Chromatography-Electroantennographic Detection (GC-EAD). The chemical profile of C. creticus and P. halepensis was rich in terpenes, alcohols, aldehydes, and esters. In the O. europaea profile, the main compounds were terpenes. As for P. myrtifolia, the volatile profile consisted mostly of alkanes and their substitutes. In the volatile profile of M. sativa, C. dactylon and L. arundinaceum, common volatile compounds were detected. Petroselinum crispum and Apium graveolens chemical profiles were dominated by terpenes. Several compounds elicited a consistent response to the female antennae of both species. In total, 65 compounds elicited consistent EAD responses for P. spumarius and 16 compounds for N. campestris. α–pinene was found in all tested plants and elicited consistent EAD responses of P. spumarius in five plants. In addition, antennae of P. spumarius females responded to camphor, limonene, 4-methyl octane and sabinene. These compounds were found in the volatile profile of at least 5 out of 8 examined plant species. Behavioral bioassays using Y-tube olfactometry were performed on volatiles that elicited antennal responses during electrophysiological studies. Among the compounds tested in behavioral studies, namely (−)-α-pinene, (+)-α-pinene, sabinene, (−)-S-limonene and (1R)-(+)-camphor, only the last one elicited a significant attraction response by P. spumarius females. The results achieved shed light on the VOCs from selected host plant species of X. fastidiosa that are perceived by two important insect vectors and a non-host plant, P. crispum. The identification of semiochemicals for manipulating spittlebugs’ behavior contribute to the development of efficient monitoring tools for X. fastidiosa vectors.},

These interactions influence belowground signaling, can create non-linear diffusion profiles, and result in surface adsorbtion and degradation of volatiles in space and time. By examining diffusion and degradation in sand-filled microcosms, we found that the diffusion profiles of E-β-caryophyllene, d-limonene, pregeijerene, α-pinene, germacrene-d, and linalool were affected by moisture and pH. Furthermore, the common plant volatile linalool was non-diffusive below ground. In addition, we discovered a novel pathway for the degradation of linalool into rapidly diffusing belowground signals.

	abstract = {Abstract
Phenotypic plasticity enables invididuals to change their phenotype in response to their environment. These phenotypic changes can affect many interactions between the members of a community. Plants are able to respond towards herbivore attack by defensive mechanisms directly affecting the herbivore and by so-called indirect defences that negatively affect the herbivore by maintenance or attraction of carnivores. The phenotypic changes of plants caused by induced defences may vary with the type of attackers. Different attackers can evoke different plant responses due to specific elicitors or wounding. These different plant responses may be mediated by different choreographies of gene expression. Symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms associated with the plant or the herbivore may play an important role in the induction process. Thus, a plethora of biotic factors affect the physiological, chemical, and molecular characteristics of plants in response to attack. The adaptiveness of phenotypic plasticity in terms of induced responses depends on the balance of their physiological and ecological costs and benefits. An integrated approach is necessary considering ecological, molecular and chemical aspects to gain deeper insight into induced defence and its application in environmentally benign crop protection. Phänotypische Plastizität befähigt Individuen, ihren Phänotyp in Reaktion auf Umweltreize zu ändern. Die phänotypischen Veränderungen können zahlreiche Interaktionen zwischen den Mitgliedern einer Biozönose beeinflussen. Angriffe von Herbivoren können in Pflanzen direkte und indirekte Verteidigungsmechanismen induzieren. Während die direkte Verteidigung sich unmittelbar gegen die Herbivoren richtet, wirkt die indirekte Abwehr über die Beherbergung oder Anlockung von Carnivoren auf die Herbivoren ein. Die induzierten phänotypischen Veränderungen der Pflanze sind je nach Typ des Angreifers sehr unterschiedlich. Unterschiedliche Herbivore können aufgrund verschiedener Fraßverhalten und aufgrund spezifischer Elicitoren jeweils ganz unterschiedliche pflanzliche Reaktionen hervorrufen. Die Vielfalt der pflanzlichen Antworten auf Herbivorenfraß wird bestimmt durch unterschiedliche Muster in der Expression der an der Abwehr beteiligten Gene. Symbiontische und pathogene Mikroorganismen, die mit der Pflanze oder den Herbivoren assoziiert sind, können eine wichtige Rolle im Induktionsprozess spielen. Demnach beeinflusst eine Fülle biotischer Faktoren die physiologischen, chemischen und molekularen Charakteristika der fraßinduzierten pflanzlichen Verteidigung. Der adaptive Wert der phänotypischen Plastizität, die sich in der Vielfalt der induzierten Verteidigungsmechanismen spiegelt, hängt vom Gleichgewicht der physiologischen und ökologischen Kosten und Nutzen der Abwehrreaktionen ab. Zum tieferen Verständnis der induzierten pflanzlichen Abwehr gegen Herbivore sowie zur Nutzung der induzierten Abwehrreaktion im umweltverträglichen Pflanzenschutz ist eine integrierte Herangehensweise notwendig, die sowohl ökologische wie auch molekulare und chemische Aspekte berücksichtigt.},

Almost one-fifth of the atmospheric CO2 fixed by land plants is released back into the air each day as volatiles.

	abstract = {The study of chemical ecology, particularly involving pheromones and other semiochemicals that influence insect behaviour, promises methods of pest control as alternatives to the exclusive use of broad-spectrum toxicants. However, if the potential of semiochemicals in crop protection is to be realised, a greater understanding of insect/insect and insect/plant interactions, and insect chemical ecology generally, is essential. Semiochemicals, when employed alone, often give ineffective or insufficiently robust pest control. Use of semiochemicals should therefore be combined with other approaches in integrated management strategies. The main components of such strategies are pest monitoring, to allow accurate timing of pesticide treatments; combined use of semiochemicals, host plant resistance and trap crops, to manipulate pest behaviour; selective insecticides or biological control agents, to reduce pest populations. The objective is to draw together these approaches into a push-pull or stimulo-deterrent diversionary strategy (SDDS). In an SDDS, the harvestable crop is protected by host-masking agents, repellents, antifeedants or oviposition deterrents. At the same time, aggregative semiochemicals, including host plant attractants and sex pheromones, stimulate colonisation of pests on trap crops or entry into traps where pathogens can be deployed. Because the individual components of the SDDS are not in themselves highly efficient, they do not select for resistance as strongly as conventional toxicant pesticides, thereby making the SDDS intrinsically more sustainable.},

	abstract = {The “nontargeted effects” of ionizing radiation, including bystander effects and genomic instability, predominate after low dose exposures and dominate response outcomes. These effects are unique in that no classic mutagenic event occurs in the cell showing the effect. In the case of bystander effects, cells which were not in the field affected by the radiation show high levels of mutations, chromosome aberrations, ROS, and membrane signaling changes (i.e., horizontal transmission of mutations and information which may be damaging). This can be contrasted with the case of genomic instability, where generations of cells derived from an irradiated progenitor appear normal, but then lethal and nonlethal mutations appear in distant progeny (i.e., vertical transmission). These phenomena are characterized by high yields of mutations and distant occurrences of events both in space and time. This precludes a mutator phenotype or other conventional explanation and appears to indicate a generalized form of ROS-mediated, stress-induced mutagenesis, which is well documented in bacteria. The nature of the signal traveling between irradiated and unirradiated cells and organisms is currently unknown, but recent evidence suggests that there may be a physical component such as a vibration wave involved. UV photon-mediated transmission has also been documented and the latter mechanisms can induce the release of exosomes, which by themselves can induce bystander effects when added to recipient cells. This review will discuss the phenomenology of nontargeted effects both in vitro and in vivo; it includes recent data suggesting that excitation decay-induced photons in the UVA range lead to exosome release, resulting in mitochondrial malfunction and elevated ROS in recipient cells. Photons, calcium, and neurochemicals are important factors in signal production, while the exosome cargo and cytokine mediated pathways, especially TGFb, are implicated in response to the signal. Important clues from the field of chemical ecology are reviewed to highlight the fact that signaling is very widespread in biota, and that many mechanisms and signals are extensively researched in the field. By highlighting some key challenges and controversies concerning the mechanisms and, more importantly, the reason these effects exist, we will discuss current ideas about the wider implications of nontargeted effects in evolution and environmental biology.},

	abstract = {Volatile plant secondary metabolites are detected by the highly sensitive olfactory system employed by insects to locate suitable plants as hosts and to avoid unsuitable hosts. Perception of these compounds depends on olfactory receptor neurones (ORNs) in sensillae, mostly on the insect antennae, which can recognise individual molecular structures. Perception of blends of plant volatiles plays a pivotal role in host recognition, non-host avoidance and ensuing behavioural responses as different responses can occur to a whole blend compared to individual components. There are emergent properties of blend perception because components of the host blend may not be recognised as host when perceived outside the context of that blend. Often there is redundancy in the composition of blends recognised as host because certain compounds can be substituted by others. Fine spatio-temporal resolution of the synchronous firing of ORNs tuned to specific compounds enables insects to pick out relevant host odour cues against high background noise and with ephemeral exposure to the volatiles at varying concentrations. This task is challenging as they usually rely on ubiquitous plant volatiles and not those taxonomically characteristic of host plants. However, such an odour coding system has the advantage of providing flexibility; it allows for adaptation to changing environments by alterations in signal processing while maintaining the same peripheral olfactory receptors.},

As well as having a role in attracting the natural enemies of herbivores, inducible VOCs are also involved in plant-to-plant signalling, pathogen defence and ozone quenching, as well as tropospheric ozone and fine-particle aerosol formation. To relate these diverse observations to active plant defence, a conceptual framework of four functional levels (plant cellular interspace, leaf boundary layer, ecosystem and atmosphere) of inducible VOCs is proposed to aid understanding of the evolutionary role of inducible plant volatiles.},

	abstract = {Plants are faced with a trade-off between on the one hand growth, development and reproduction and on the other hand defence against environmental stresses. Yet, research on insect–plant interactions has addressed plant–pollinator interactions and plant–attacker interactions separately. Plants have evolved a high diversity of constitutive and induced responses to attack, including the systemic emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). The effect of HIPVs on the behaviour of carnivorous insects has received ample attention for leaf-feeding (folivorous) species and their parasitoids and predators. Here, we review whether and to what extent HIPVs affect the interaction of plants in the flowering stage with mutualistic and antagonistic insects. Whereas the role of flower volatiles in the interactions between plants and insect pollinators has received increased attention over the last decade, studies addressing both HIPVs and pollinator behaviour are rare, despite the fact that in a number of plant species herbivory is known to affect flower traits, including size, nectar secretion and composition. In addition, folivory and florivory can also result in significant changes in flower volatile emission and in most systems investigated, pollinator visitation decreased, although exceptions have been found. Negative effects of HIPVs on pollinator visitation rates likely exert negative selection pressure on HIPV emission. The systemic nature of herbivore-induced plant responses and the behavioural responses of antagonistic and mutualistic insects, requires the study of volatile emission of entire plants in the flowering stage. We conclude that approaches to integrate the study of plant defences and pollination are essential to advance plant biology, in particular in the context of the trade-off between defence and growth/reproduction.},

	abstract = {Interactions between spatially-separated aboveground and belowground biota exert important influences on the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Plant root exudates and litter inputs affect root-associated and decomposer sub-communities, which, in turn, regulate nutrient availability and plant growth. Ecosystem services theoretically attributed to specific functional components of aboveground or belowground biota are, therefore, influenced by indirect (plant-mediated) interactions with the wider community. Some recent studies have considered aboveground–belowground interactions in a climate change context, with implications for altered ecosystem service provision. This review is a conceptual discussion of the mechanisms by which aboveground–belowground interactions affect specific ecosystem services: control of herbivores by natural enemies, insect pollination and nutrient mineralization by soil decomposers. While some mechanisms are well-characterized, others are poorly understood. Reducing root and shoot herbivory, in addition to the direct plant benefit, indirectly promotes antagonism of the spatially-separate herbivore by its natural enemies. Soil decomposers and mycorrhizal fungi can increase shoot herbivore performance such that control by natural enemies is weakened, or initiate bottom-up trophic cascades which strengthen antagonism of shoot herbivores. Aboveground herbivory generally stimulates nutrient cycling by decomposers. Root herbivory and mycorrhizal association both appear to increase floral attractiveness to insect pollinators. Mechanisms reflect alterations to plant growth, nutritional quality and chemical defenses. Climate change has considerable potential to alter aboveground–belowground interactions, with largely unexplored implications for biological control, pollination and soil nutrient cycling.},

	abstract = {Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a major currency in plant communication where they mediate above- and below-ground interactions between plants and the surrounding organisms (i.e., other plants, microorganisms, pollinators, seed dispersers, herbivores, and their natural enemies). Considering the multiple interactions mediated by VOCs and their impact on a plant’s reproductive success and survival, they can be a crucial weapon in plant-plant competition. However, this particular role of VOCs is underrepresented in the literature. Mechanisms by which volatiles can mediate plant competition can be direct or indirect. Direct mechanisms include establishing a neighbour’s identity and status to select adequate responses and affecting competitor’s seed germination or growth through VOC-mediated allelopathy. Indirect mechanisms can affect the plant's competitive ability by modifying interactions with other trophic levels, for instance, through associational resistance or chemical camouflage. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and can be seen as part of a continuum. In this review, we present evidence from the literature to illustrate these roles and indicate how they could influence competition in plant communities. We propose new research avenues to test if and how these mechanisms affect competitive outcomes and suggest that, in addition to morphological traits, future competition studies should also incorporate data on plant-volatile emissions and measure their effects on the surrounding plants and other trophic levels. This information would allow us to understand competition from a broader perspective by acknowledging the existence of multiple (possibly coexisting) competition strategies and the role of other trophic levels in shaping competitive outcomes.},

In Grapholita molesta, ph-ORNs are highly sensitive and specific to the individual sex pheromone components, and thus help in the detection and discrimination of the unique conspecific pheromone blend. Plant odors interspersed with a sub-optimal pheromone dose are reported to increase male moth attraction. To determine if the behavioral synergism of pheromone and plant odors starts at the ph-ORN level, single sensillum recordings were performed on Z8-12:Ac and E8-12:Ac ph-ORNs (Z-ORNs and E-ORNs, respectively) stimulated with pheromone–plant volatile mixtures. First, biologically meaningful plant-volatile doses were determined by recording the response of plant-specific ORNs housed in sensilla auricillica and trichodea to several plant odorants. This exploration provided a first glance at plant ORNs in this species. Then, using these plant volatile doses, we found that the spontaneous activity of ph-ORNs was not affected by the stimulation with plant volatiles, but that a binary mixture of sex pheromone and plant odorants resulted in a small (about 15\%), dose-independent, but statistically significant, reduction in the spike frequency of Z-ORNs with respect to stimulation with Z8-12:Ac alone. The response of E-ORNs to a combination of E8-12:Ac and plant volatiles was not different from E8-12:Ac alone. We argue that the small inhibition of Z-ORNs caused by physiologically realistic plant volatile doses is probably not fully responsible for the observed behavioral synergism of pheromone and plant odors.},

The irregular acyclic homoterpenes, 4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT) and 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT), are among the most widespread volatiles produced by angiosperms with emissions from flowers and from vegetative tissues upon herbivore feeding. Special attention has been placed on the role of homoterpenes in attracting parasitoids and predators of herbivores and has sparked interest in engineering homoterpene formation to improve biological pest control. The biosynthesis of DMNT and TMTT proceeds in two enzymatic steps: the formation of the tertiary C15-, and C20-alcohols, (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-geranyl linalool, respectively, catalyzed by terpene synthases, and the subsequent oxidative degradation of both alcohols by a single cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450). In Arabidopsis thaliana, the herbivore-induced biosynthesis of TMTT is catalyzed by the concerted activities of the (E,E)-geranyllinalool synthase, AtGES, and CYP82G1, a P450 of the so far uncharacterized plant CYP82 family. TMTT formation is in part controlled at the level of AtGES expression. Co-expression of AtGES with CYP82G1 at wound sites allows for an efficient conversion of the alcohol intermediate. The identified homoterpene biosynthesis genes in Arabidopsis and related genes from other plant species provide tools to engineer homoterpene formation and to address questions of the regulation and specific activities of homoterpenes in plant–herbivore interactions.},

Moreover, herbivores, pathogens, pollinators and competitors also respond to HIPVs and, in addition, neighbouring plants in native populations also emit volatiles that provide a background odour. These considerations enrich the evolutionary context of HIPVs and complicate predictions about their adaptive value. Molecular advances in our understanding of HIPV signaling and biosynthesis is enabling the creation of HIPV-’mute’ and possibly HIPV-’deaf’ plants.

Nevertheless, recent meta-analyses and empirical work emphasize the importance of parasitoids in structuring interactions among lower trophic levels. Two promising areas of research are particularly ripe for future exploration: a) the potential for microbes to alter the interactions among plants, insect herbivores, and parasitoids, and b) the effects of climate change on phenological (mis)matches among trophic levels.},

The knowledge on the interaction of tobacco plant volatiles and PTM behavior is limited. To clarify the effect of tobacco plant volatiles on the orientation and oviposition behaviors of PTM and to identify potential compounds for PTM control, tobacco plant volatiles were collected by headspace collection method, and volatile compounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Thirteen electrophysiological active compounds were screened by employing coupled gas chromatography-electroantennogram detection and from which nine available compounds were further verified by electroantennogram recording. cis-3-Hexen-1-ol showed significant attractant effect on the orientation behaviors of both male and female moths. Nonanal and decanal could only attract females, while octanal exhibited repellent effect on males. Oviposition selection experiment indicated that nonanal, decanal, decane and methyl hexadecanoate could stimulate the gravid females to lay more eggs, while octanal and 2,6-bis(1,1-dimethylenthyl)-4-methyl phenol inhibited their oviposition. Our study added more compounds to the list that could serve as potential PTM deterrents or attractants.},

	abstract = {Volatile emissions from urban parks and forests can significantly contribute to local and regional air quality due to biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions from vegetation, but the source strength of BVOC of urban habitats is difficult to assess due to a complex mixture of ornamental species with widely varying leaf and whole plant characteristics and taxonomy. Furthermore, there is very limited information of BVOC emission characteristics of subtropical urban sites and overall lack of information of emission capacity of aromatic compounds that are often left out in BVOC screening studies. We investigated BVOC emissions from healthy mature leaves of 45 East-Asian subtropical wide-spread broad-leaved ornamental woody species with contrasting leaf structure and longevity (evergreen vs. deciduous), growth form (shrub vs. tree) and temperature, light and water requirements to characterize the overall frequency of volatile emissions in relation to species characteristics. BVOC emissions were characterized by the share of each compound and compound class in total emissions, absolute emission rates and frequency of emission of different volatiles. Isoprene contributed the greatest share of total emissions (42.6 \%), followed by monoterpenes (29.7 \%), sesquiterpenes (13.8 \%) and aromatic compounds (7.5 \%). However, isoprene was emitted only in 20 \% of species, whereas the other volatile compound classes were emitted in the majority of species (35.6 \%–95.6 \%). The overall emission rates were relatively low for isoprene (up to 1.7 nmol m−2 s-1 and for aromatics (up to 0.2 nmol m−2 s-1) and moderately high for terpenes (up to 0.8 nmol m−2 s-1 for both mono- and sesquiterpenes). Isoprenoid and aromatic compound emissions were positively correlated across the species. Multivariate analyses indicated that species taxonomy poorly explained the emission patterns, but for most compound classes, the emissions were higher in species with structurally more robust leaves (higher leaf dry mass per unit area, and lower leaf water content) and in species capable of growing in environments with higher light, higher temperature and lower water availability. In addition, isoprene emissions were more prevalent in deciduous species and aromatic emissions in evergreens. Overall, the study emphasizes that apart from isoprene, urban ornamentals constitute a large source of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and aromatic compounds and that planting of stress resistant species that require less maintenance might enhance BVOC emissions.},

Grapevine moth males compete heavily during limited time windows for females. The aim of this study was to investigate the perception of host plant volatiles by grapevine moth males and whether such compounds elicit upwind oriented flights. We compared five host plant headspace extracts by means of gas chromatography linked electroantennogram (EAG) recording. We identified 12 common host plant volatiles (aliphatic esters, aldehydes, and alcohols, aromatic compounds and terpenes) that elicit EAG responses from grapevine moth males and that occur in at least three of the host plant volatile headspace extracts tested. Subsequently the behavioural response of grapevine moth males to four these compounds presented singly and in mixtures (1-hexanol, 1-octen-3-ol, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate and (E)-β-caryophyllene) was recorded in a wind tunnel. Grapevine moth males engaged in upwind flights to all of four compounds when released singly at 10,000pg/min and to all, except 1-octen-3-ol, when released at 100pg/min. A blend of the four host plant volatiles released at 10,000pg/min and mixed at a ratio based on the analysis of Vitis vinifera cv. Solaris volatile emissions attracted significantly more males than any single compound. Grapevine moth males perceive and respond to host plant volatiles at biologically relevant levels indicating that host plant volatiles figure as olfactory cues and that L. botrana males can discern places where the likelihood of encountering females is higher.},

This preparing for future competition mechanism affects the behaviour and abundance of herbivore pests and their natural enemies. Previously, such responses were only known to occur in response to volatiles released by damaged plants.

Even though these organisms have been studied for more than 100y, their effective use in the field remains elusive. Recently, however, it has been discovered that many of these entomopathogenic fungi play additional roles in nature. They are endophytes, antagonists of plant pathogens, associates with the rhizosphere, and possibly even plant growth promoting agents. These findings indicate that the ecological role of these fungi in the environment is not fully understood and limits our ability to employ them successfully for pest management. In this paper, we review the recently discovered roles played by many entomopathogenic fungi and propose new research strategies focused on alternate uses for these fungi. It seems likely that these agents can be used in multiple roles in protecting plants from pests and diseases and at the same time promoting plant growth.},

However, the primary function of HIPVs is still subject to much debate, as is the possibility of using these plant-produced cues in crop protection. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of HIPVs in tritrophic interactions from an ecological as well as a mechanistic perspective. This overview focuses on the main gaps in our knowledge of tritrophic interactions, and we argue that filling these gaps will greatly facilitate efforts to exploit HIPVs for pest control.},

	abstract = {Summary
It is increasingly evident that plants interact with their outside world through the production of volatile organic compounds,1, 2, 3, 4, 5 but whether the volatiles have evolved to serve in plant defense is still a topic of considerable debate.3,6, 7, 8 Unharmed leaves constitutively release small amounts of volatiles, but when the leaves are damaged by herbivorous arthropods, they emit substantially more volatiles. These herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) attract parasitoids and predators that kill insect herbivores,9, 10, 11, 12 and this can benefit the plants.13,14 As yet, however, there is no tangible evolutionary evidence that this tritrophic interplay contributes to the selection forces that have shaped the volatile emissions of plants.2,3,5, 6, 7, 8,15 With this in mind, we investigated the evolutionary changes in volatile emissions in invasive common ragwort and the respective defensive roles of its constitutive and inducible volatiles. This Eurasian plant has invaded other continents, where it evolved for many generations in the absence of specialized herbivores and their natural enemies. We found that, compared to native ragworts, invasive plants release higher levels of constitutive volatiles but considerably lower levels of herbivore-induced volatiles. As a consequence, invasive ragwort is more attractive to a specialist moth but avoided by an unadapted generalist moth. Importantly, conforming to the indirect defense hypothesis, a specialist parasitoid was much more attracted to caterpillar-damaged native ragwort, which was reflected in higher parasitism rates in a field trial. The evolution of foliar volatile emissions appears to be indeed driven by their direct and indirect roles in defenses against insects.},

Here we propose that the combined use of plant volatiles and pheromones can efficiently guide insects to these sites, where they will have access to both mates and food. This notion is supported by the fact that plant volatiles can stimulate the release of sex pheromones and can render various insects more receptive to potential mates.},

	abstract = {The multicolored Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), is a common generalist predator in China and is occasionally found gathering on the Chinese pagoda tree, Sophora japonica, in summer. In a field investigation, we found that H. axyridis adults preferred S. japonica during its flowering period even though their optimal prey (aphid) is absent at this time. In addition, male and female adults were attracted to S. japonica flowers to a similar extent in a Y-tube olfactometer assay. Using coupled gas chromatography-electroantennogram detection (GC-EAD), we identified a flower odor component (nonanal) that elicited a significant electrophysiological response in H. axyridis. Electroantennogram (EAG) dose-dependent responses revealed that the amplitude of the adult beetle's EAG response increased with increasing concentration of nonanal, peaking at 10 mg mL−1. In Y-tube olfactometer behavioral tests, H. axyridis adults preferred a 10 mg mL−1 nonanal source over a 100 mg mL−1 diluent. Under field conditions, the adults were significantly attracted to both concentrations (10 and 100 mg mL−1), and high concentrations generally had greater attraction. All these results suggest that nonanal, a volatile compound of S. japonica flowers, greatly attracts H. axyridis adults. This study provides a basis for the development of synthetic attractants of H. axyridis, with the potential to promote biocontrol services of this generalist predator in the native area (e.g., China) and to suppress its population by mass trapping in its invasive areas.},

We first examine the various mechanisms used by aphids for defence against these enemies. We then explore the strategies used by aphidiine parasitoids to exploit their aphid hosts. Finally, we consider the responses of both aphids and parasitoids to ecological constraints induced by seasonal cycles and to environmental variations linked to host plants and climate.

Recent research has focused on the use of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) for the management of biotic stresses plants. The changing climate also calls for a focus on the impact of adverse climatic factors on volatile emissions and their role in plant defense. The work done in this area is broadly discussed with a focus on the biosynthetic pathways; constitutive and induced emissions from leaves, flowers, and roots; their effect on herbivores, natural enemies, and hyperparasitoids; applications in pest management; prospects of genetic manipulation of volatile emission; status of work done in the rice crop; the impact of elevated temperature, CO2, and ozone on volatile emissions; and the negative impacts of manipulating HIPVs. Understanding and utilizing chemical ecology in pest management can pave the way for a sustainable strategy with less impact on the environment.},

Current semiochemically-based management strategies still fail to significantly reduce damages and need to be improved. Here we describe under scanning and transmission electron microscopy the structure and distribution of the sensilla that are displayed on adult antennae. These were similar in size between males (3424.4±135.3μm) and females (3292.1±111.5μm), being segmented into a scape, a pedicel, and a distal filiform flagellum. Eight morphological sensilla types were observed on both sexes: Böhm’s bristles, sensilla squamiformia, sensilla trichodea, sensilla basiconica (two subtypes), sensilla chaetica, sensilla coeloconica, sensilla auricillica, and sensilla styloconica. The main sexual dimorphism was related to the higher abundance of sensilla trichodea in males, twice as abundant as in females. The putative functional significance of the different sensilla types regarding the insect ecology is discussed based on the available literature. This work provides descriptions of the antennae and related sensory structures. We expect these results to help develop further electrophysiological investigations aiming to a better understanding of T. absoluta olfaction.},

While foraging behavior of natural enemies has been extensively studied under controlled conditions, little is known on how odor-guided foraging behavior is influenced by fluctuating weather conditions in the field. Here we investigated how HIPV-guided foraging of Cotesia glomerata parasitoids is influenced by prevailing weather conditions in the field. C. glomerata females were released in 5 m radius circles of cabbage plants infested with Pieris brassicae caterpillars, and host finding success and direction of foraging activity was assessed by recapturing parasitoids on the host-infested plants. Wind speed and direction, humidity, barometric pressure and temperature was recorded and related to parasitoid foraging activity. Parasitoid foraging behavior was studied in more detail by observing individually released parasitoids in 0.5 m circles with host-infested cabbages. Recapture rates and movement direction of parasitoids was influenced by an interaction between humidity, wind speed, temperature and change in barometric pressure. High humidity and low wind speed was generally positively associated with host finding success. Direct observations of parasitoid flight behavior confirmed the influence of humidity and wind speed. Successful host finding in upwind direction was only observed at wind speeds below 3 m/s. Our study highlights the complex ways in which weather variables moderate parasitoid foraging behavior under field conditions. Since unfavorable weather conditions result in a strong reduction in parasitoid foraging efficiency, weather conditions are an important factor in the effectiveness of parasitoids as biocontrol agents.},

The emerging techniques that can be summarized under the concept of metabolomics provide new opportunities to study such environmentally relevant signaling molecules. Especially comparative tools in metabolomics enable the identification of compounds that are regulated during interaction situations and that might play a role as e.g. pheromones, allelochemicals or in induced and activated defenses. This approach helps overcoming limitations of traditional bioassay-guided structure elucidation approaches. But the power of metabolomics is not limited to the comparison of metabolic profiles of interacting partners. Especially the link to other –omics techniques helps to unravel not only the compounds in question but the entire biosynthetic and genetic re-wiring, required for an ecological response. This review comprehensively highlights successful applications of metabolomics in chemical ecology and discusses existing limitations of these novel techniques. It focuses on recent developments in comparative metabolomics and discusses the use of metabolomics in the systems biology of organismal interactions. It also outlines the potential of large metabolomics initiatives for model organisms in the field of chemical ecology.},

The new method is demonstrated with whole-animal male Helicoverpa zea antennal preparations for detection of major pheromone component (cis-11-hexadecenal) and compared to results obtained using traditional EAD recording techniques. Results indicate that chopper stabilization under these circumstances can increase odorant detection performance by a factor of approximately 104 over traditional methods. The time course of the response of the antenna is also better resolved under chopped conditions.

	abstract = {The invasive larger grain borer, Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae), originating from Meso-America, is a devastating stored product pest of maize (Zea mays L.) and cassava (Manihot esculenta). This species can destroy up to 40\% of stored maize within four months. Despite four decades of research, P. truncatus has spread throughout Africa, while decimating maize and cassava production. Given the continuing problems with P. truncatus, the likelihood for its continued range expansion under climate change, and its status as a species of concern in many countries, the objective of this review was to provide an updated and comprehensive freely accessible record of the distribution and spread, biology, development, and ecology, host preferences, chemical ecology, detection, and monitoring, and management of P. truncatus. We conducted a search of the literature from 1911 to 2021 using Google Scholar and Web of Science to find all papers related to key search terms. We found that P. truncatus has been recorded in 36 countries across the globe, including 21 now in Africa. A recent predictive model found that the insect has been limited to tropical and subtropical regions but could likely spread to temperate regions as temperatures rise with climate change. Conspecifics respond to their two component, male-produced aggregation pheromone early after eclosion, but quickly switch to other cues as older adults. At close-range, P. truncatus may use food cues, but host volatiles are not involved in long-range host finding of commodities. Research on managing P. truncatus has mostly focused on chemical control to the detriment of other tactics, with the most promising tactic likely to be the different hermetic storage technologies. Many outstanding areas of basic behavior and ecology remain to be assessed for P. truncatus. We highlight specific areas that should be prioritized for further work in order to better manage and reduce the impact of this invasive insect pest.},

	abstract = {Elucidating the chemical ecology of natural enemies, herbivores and host plants is important in the development of effective and successful integrated pest management (IPM) strategies where abundance and distribution of natural enemies could be manipulated by semiochemicals for improved conservation biological control (CBC). In response to attack by herbivores, plants produce semiochemicals called Herbivore-Induced Plant Volatiles (HIPVs) which act to repel pests and attract their natural enemies. Damaged, and in some cases, intact plants may also produce volatile signals that warn other plants of impending attack. Some of these intact plants are used as intercrops in ‘push–pull’ strategies; cropping systems based on stimulo-deterrent principle, where the target crop is intercropped with herbivore repellent plants (push) while attractant plants (pull) are planted around this intercrop. The intercrop, in addition to repelling the herbivores, attracts and conserves natural enemies thereby ensuring continued suppression of the pests. This natural delivery of semiochemicals for CBC is currently being exploited by smallholder farmers in eastern Africa in the management of cereal stemborers in maize and sorghum. Synthetic HIPVs also have the potential to effectively recruit natural enemies, thereby improving CBC as has been demonstrated in a series of field experiments in vineyards and hop yards in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Potentially, plants could be ‘turned on’ by synthetic HIPV signals, and therefore become sources of natural enemy-recruiting volatiles. With the rapid development of plant molecular biology, modification of secondary plant metabolism is also possible which could allow appropriate semiochemicals to be generated by plants at certain growth stages. By identifying the promoter sequences associated with external plant signals that induce biochemical pathways, plant defense genes could be ‘switched on’ prior to insect attack. We review recent research on ‘push–pull’ strategies and synthetic HIPVs in recruitment of beneficial arthropods and warding off pest attack.},

Understanding these influences thus has significant implications for the sustainable management of natural and agricultural ecosystems and should be a priority for future research.},

Here, we focus on two induced indirect defences, namely the de novo production of volatiles and the secretion of extrafloral nectar, which both mediate interactions with organisms from higher trophic levels (i.e., parasitoids or carnivores). We give an overview on elicitors, early signals, and signal transduction resulting in a complex regulation of indirect defences and discuss effects of cross-talks between the signalling pathways (synergistic and antagonistic effects). In the light of recent findings, we review molecular and genetic aspects of the biosynthesis of herbivore-induced plant volatiles comprising terpenoids, aromatic compounds, and metabolites of fatty acids which act as infochemicals for animals and some of which even induce defence genes in neighbouring plants. Finally, ecological aspects of these two indirect defences such as their variability, specificity, evolution as well as their ecological relevance in nature are discussed.},

However, the increasing population of A. lucorum since growing Bt cotton widely and the increased awareness of ecoenvironment and agricultural product safety makes their population-control very challenging. Therefore this study was conducted to explore a novel ecological approach, synthetic plant volatile analogues, to manage the pest. Here, plant volatile analogues were first designed and synthesized by combining the bioactive components of β-ionone and benzaldehyde. The stabilities of β-ionone, benzaldehyde and analogue 3 g were tested. The electroantennogram (EAG) responses of A. lucorum adult antennae to the analogues were recorded. And the behavior assay and filed experiment were also conducted. In this study, thirteen analogues were acquired. The analogue 3 g was demonstrated to be more stable than β-ionone and benzaldehyde in the environment. Many of the analogues elicited EAG responses, and the EAG response values to 3 g remained unchanged during seven-day period. 3 g was also demonstrated to be attractive to A. lucorum adults in the laboratory behavior experiment and in the field. Its attractiveness persisted longer than β-ionone and benzaldehyde. This indicated that 3 g can strengthen attractiveness to insect and has potential as an attractant. Our results suggest that synthetic plant volatile analogues can strengthen attractiveness to insect. This is the first published study about synthetic plant volatile analogues that have the potential to be used in pest control. Our results will support a new ecological approach to pest control and it will be helpful to ecoenvironment and agricultural product safety. PMID:24911460},

This study evaluated the VOC emissions produced by Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Col-0 subjected to 3 temperature regimes (17, 22, and 27°C) in the presence and absence of Plutella xylostella larvae over 2 time intervals (0–4 and 4–8 h), in comparison to control plants. The analyses of VOCs emitted by Arabidopsis plants were made by headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). It was found that certain volatile groups (e.g., alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, and terpenes) are induced by both single factors (temperature or larval infestation) and combined factors (temperature and larvae interactions), whereas other volatile groups (e.g., isothiocyanates [ITCs] and nitrile) were specific to the experimental conditions. ITCs (mainly 4-methylpentyl isothiocyanate) were emitted from plants subjected to larval infestation at 17 and 27°C after the 2 time intervals. The proportions of sulfides (mainly dimethyl disulfide) and 4-(methylthio) butanenitrile were significantly higher on herbivore-infested plants at 22°C compared to the other treatments. Overall, our findings indicate that changes in all experimental conditions caused significant changes to the VOC emissions of Arabidopsis plants. Therefore, the interaction between temperature and larval feeding may represent an important factor determining the variability of volatile emissions by plants subjected to multiple simultaneous factors.

Transcriptional reprogramming was characterized using co-expression analysis in damaged and undamaged leaves at two times in response to mechanical wounding and four insect species. In all, 2778 (10.6\%) of annotated genes on the array were differentially expressed in at least one treatment. Responses differed mainly between aphid and caterpillar and sampling times. Responses to aphids and caterpillars shared only 10\% of up-regulated and 8\% of down-regulated genes. Responses to two caterpillars shared 21 and 12\% of up- and down-regulated genes, whereas responses to the two aphids shared only 7 and 4\% of up-regulated and down-regulated genes. Overlap in genes expressed between 6 and 24 h was 3–15\%, and depended on the insect species. Responses in attacked and unattacked leaves differed at 6 h but converged by 24 h. Genes responding to the insects are also responsive to many stressors and included primary metabolism. Aphids down-regulated amino acid catabolism; caterpillars stimulated production of amino acids involved in glucosinolate synthesis. Co-expression analysis revealed 17 response networks. Transcription factors were a major portion of differentially expressed genes throughout and responsive genes shared most of the known or postulated binding sites. However, cis-element composition of genes down regulated by the aphid M. persicae was unique, as were those of genes down-regulated by caterpillars. As many as 20 cis-elements were over-represented in one or more treatments, including some from well-characterized classes and others as yet uncharacterized. We suggest that transcriptional changes elicited by wounding and insects are heavily influenced by transcription factors and involve both enrichment of a common set of cis-elements and a unique enrichment of a few cis-elements in responding genes.},

	abstract = {Methanol is the second most abundant volatile organic compound in the troposphere and plays a significant role in atmospheric chemistry. While there is consensus about the dominant role of living plants as the major source and the reaction with OH as the major sink of methanol, global methanol budgets diverge considerably in terms of source/sink estimates, reflecting uncertainties in the approaches used to model and the empirical data used to separately constrain these terms. Here we compiled micrometeorological methanol flux data from eight different study sites and reviewed the corresponding literature in order to provide a first cross-site synthesis of the terrestrial ecosystem-scale methanol exchange and present an independent data-driven view of the land–atmosphere methanol exchange. Our study shows that the controls of plant growth on production, and thus the methanol emission magnitude, as well as stomatal conductance on the hourly methanol emission variability, established at the leaf level, hold across sites at the ecosystem level. Unequivocal evidence for bi-directional methanol exchange at the ecosystem scale is presented. Deposition, which at some sites even exceeds methanol emissions, represents an emerging feature of ecosystem-scale measurements and is likely related to environmental factors favouring the formation of surface wetness. Methanol may adsorb to or dissolve in this surface water and eventually be chemically or biologically removed from it. Management activities in agriculture and forestry are shown to increase local methanol emission by orders of magnitude; however, they are neglected at present in global budgets. While contemporary net land methanol budgets are overall consistent with the grand mean of the micrometeorological methanol flux measurements, we caution that the present approach of simulating methanol emission and deposition separately is prone to opposing systematic errors and does not allow for full advantage to be taken of the rich information content of micrometeorological flux measurements.},

	abstract = {Jasmonic acid (JA) plays a central role in induced plant defence e.g. by regulating the biosynthesis of herbivore-induced plant volatiles that mediate the attraction of natural enemies of herbivores. Moreover, exogenous application of JA can be used to elicit plant defence responses similar to those induced by biting-chewing herbivores and mites that pierce cells and consume their contents. In the present study, we used Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) plants to explore how application of a low dose of JA followed by minor herbivory by spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) affects transcript levels of P. lunatus (E)-β-ocimene synthase (PlOS), emission of (E)-β-ocimene and nine other plant volatiles commonly associated with herbivory. Furthermore, we investigated the plant’s phytohormonal response. Application of a low dose of JA increased PlOS transcript levels in a synergistic manner when followed by minor herbivory for both simultaneous and sequential infestation. Emission of (E)-β-ocimene was also increased, and only JA, but not SA, levels were affected by treatments. Projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of other volatiles showed overlap between treatments. Thus, a low-dose JA application results in a synergistic effect on gene transcription and an increased emission of a volatile compound involved in indirect defence after herbivore infestation.

Despite orders of magnitude difference in atmospheric reactivity and great diversity in biological functioning, little is known about monoterpene speciation in tropical forests. Here we report vertically resolved ambient air mixing ratios for 12 monoterpenes in a central Amazon rainforest including observations of the highly reactive cis-β-ocimene (160 ppt), trans-β-ocimene (79 ppt), and terpinolene (32 ppt) which accounted for an estimated 21\% of total monoterpene composition yet 55\% of the upper canopy monoterpene ozonolysis rate. All 12 monoterpenes showed a mixing ratio peak in the upper canopy, with three demonstrating subcanopy peaks in 7 of 11 profiles. Leaf level emissions of highly reactive monoterpenes accounted for up to 1.9\% of photosynthesis confirming light-dependent emissions across several Amazon tree genera. These results suggest that highly reactive monoterpenes play important antioxidant roles during photosynthesis in plants and serve as near-canopy sources of secondary organic aerosol precursors through atmospheric photooxidation via ozonolysis.},

	abstract = {For a communication system to be stable, senders should convey honest information. Providing dishonest information, however, can be advantageous to senders, which imposes a constraint on the evolution of communication systems. Beyond single populations and bitrophic systems, one may ask whether stable communication systems can evolve in multitrophic systems. Consider cross-species signalling where herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) attract predators to reduce the damage from arthropod herbivores. Such plant signals may be honest and help predators to identify profitable prey/plant types via HIPV composition and to assess prey density via the amount of HIPVs. There could be selection for dishonest signals that attract predators for protection from possible future herbivory. Recently, we described a case in which plants release a fixed, high amount of HIPVs independent of herbivore load, adopting what we labelled a ‘cry-wolf’ strategy. To understand when such signals evolve, we model coevolutionary interactions between plants, herbivores and predators, and show that both ‘honest’ and ‘cry-wolf’ types can emerge, depending on the assumed plant–herbivore encounter rates and herbivore population density. It is suggested that the ‘cry-wolf’ strategy may have evolved to reduce the risk of heavy damage in the future. Our model suggests that eco-evolutionary feedback loops involving a third species may have important consequences for the stability of this outcome. PMID:26538597},

	abstract = {Olfaction plays a dominant role in the mate-finding and host selection behaviours of the codling moth (Cydia pomonella), an important pest of apple, pear and walnut orchards worldwide. Antennal transcriptome analysis revealed a number of abundantly expressed genes related to the moth olfactory system, including those encoding the olfactory receptors (ORs) CpomOR1, CpomOR3 and CpomOR6a, which belong to the pheromone receptor (PR) lineage, and the co-receptor (CpomOrco). Using heterologous expression, in both Drosophila olfactory sensory neurones and in human embryonic kidney cells, together with electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging, we characterize the basic physiological and pharmacological properties of these receptors and demonstrate that they form functional ionotropic receptor channels. Both the homomeric CpomOrco and heteromeric CpomOrco + OR complexes can be activated by the common Orco agonists VUAA1 and VUAA3, as well as inhibited by the common Orco antagonists amiloride derivatives. CpomOR3 responds to the plant volatile compound pear ester ethyl-(E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate, while CpomOR6a responds to the strong pheromone antagonist codlemone acetate (E,E)-8,10-dodecadien-1-yl acetate. These findings represent important breakthroughs in the deorphanization of codling moth pheromone receptors, as well as more broadly into insect ecology and evolution and, consequently, for the development of sustainable pest control strategies based on manipulating chemosensory communication.

Because of their cryptic habits, control with conventional methods is difficult; therefore, alternative and environmentally friendly control strategies are highly desirable. The study of proteins that participate in the recognition of odorants, such as odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), offers interesting opportunities to identify new compounds with the potential to modify pest behavior and computational screening of compounds, which is commonly used in drug discovery, may help to accelerate the discovery of new semiochemicals. Here, we report the discovery of four OBPs in H. elegans as well as six new volatiles released by its native host Nothofagus obliqua (Mirbel). Molecular docking performed between OBPs and new and previously reported volatiles from N. obliqua revealed the best binding energy values for sesquiterpenic compounds. Despite remarkable divergence at the amino acid level, three of the four OBPs evaluated exhibited the best interaction energy for the same ligands. Molecular dynamics investigation reinforced the importance of sesquiterpenes, showing that hydrophobic residues of the OBPs interacted most frequently with the tested ligands, and binding free energy calculations demonstrated van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions to be the most important. Altogether, the results suggest that sesquiterpenes are interesting candidates for in vitro and in vivo assays to assess their potential application in pest management strategies. PMID:27012867},

Codling moth, Cydia pomonella, is a worldwide pest of apple, pear and walnut, and behavior-modifying semiochemicals are used for environmentally safe control. We produced an Illumina-based transcriptome from antennae of males and females as well as neonate head tissue, affording a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the codling moth chemosensory receptor repertoire. We identified 58 ORs, 20 GRs and 21 IRs, and provide a revised nomenclature that is consistent with homologous sequences in related species. Importantly, we have identified several OR transcripts displaying sex-biased expression in adults, as well as larval-enriched transcripts. Our analyses have expanded annotations of the chemosensory receptor gene families, and provide first-time transcript abundance estimates for codling moth. The results presented here provide a strong foundation for future work on codling moth behavioral physiology and ecology at the molecular level, and may lead to the development of more precise biorational control strategies.

	title = {Above and belowground connections and species interactions: {Controls} over ecosystem fluxes},
	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1333888},
	abstract = {The ultimate goal of this work was to quantify soil and volatile organic compound fluxes as a function of tree species and associated mycorrhizal associations in an intact forest, but also to describe the physical and biological factors that control these emissions. The results of this research lay the foundation toward an improved mechanistic understanding of carbon pathways, fluxes, and ecosystem function, ultimately improving the representation of forest ecosystems in Earth System models. To this end, a multidisciplinary approach was necessary to fill a critical gap in our understanding of how soil and root processes may influence whole-ecosystem carbon-based volatile fluxes in the face of a rapidly changing climate. We developed a series of novel sampling protocols and coupled a variety of advanced analytical techniques, resulting in findings relevant across disciplines. Furthermore, we leveraged existing infrastructure, research sites, and datasets to design a low-cost exploratory project that links belowground processes, soil volatile emissions, and total ecosystem carbon budgets. Measurements from soil collars installed across a species/mycorrhizal gradient at the DOE-supported Moran Monroe State Forest Ameriflux tower site suggest that leaf litter is the primary source of belowground and forest floor volatile emissions, but the strength of this source is significantly affected not only by leaf litter type, but the strength of the soil as a sink. Results suggest that the strength of the sink is influenced by tree species-specific associated microbial communities that change throughout the season as a function of temperature, soil moisture, leaf litter inputs, and phenology. The magnitude of the observed volatile fluxes from the forest floor is small relative to total aboveground ecosystem flux, but the contribution of these emissions to volatile-mediated ecological interactions and soil processes (e.g. nitrification) varies substantially across the growing season. This research lays the foundation to answer important questions regarding the impacts of seasonality and forest composition on belowground volatile source-sink dynamics in mediating nutrient cycling and biogeochemistry dynamics—critical components of overall ecosystem functioning. In collaboration with the Environmental Simulations Unit (EUS) at the Helmholtz Zentrum in Munich, Germany (headed by Prof. Dr. Joerg-Peter Schinitzler), we investigated carbon investment in above and belowground plant volatile compounds in response to environmental conditions and mycorrhizal associations. Using the sophisticated phytotron facility and on-line trace gas instruments, we conducted controlled laboratory experiments that showed that biotic stresses, such as herbivore feeding, can alter the magnitude of belowground volatile emissions as well as carbon allocation towards these volatiles. We saw no effect of mycorrhizae on any induced response, suggesting that microbial effects were unrelated to source-sink dynamics driving terpene emissions. Furthermore, the results suggest that even though enzyme activity responsible for root volatile synthesis is up-regulated following herbivory, the sink strength of the soil can significantly impact what is measured at the soil/atmosphere interface and thereby what enters the atmosphere. This is important as scientists may be underestimating the magnitude of belowground volatile emissions and their influence on belowground interactions due to limitations associated with current sampling techniques. These key findings are being integrated with results from a hydroxyl radical reactivity-VOC campaign and a late season litter removal experiment to offer a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the sources and controls over soil volatile emissions, particularly during times of the year when vegetative aboveground emissions are low (leaf senescence). Ultimately, these coupled field and laboratory experiments offer insights into seasonal dynamics of volatile emissions and the mechanisms that control carbon allocation to these compo},

Simultaneous impact of the insect damage and pathogenic bacteria in infected host plants induce volatiles that modify not only the behavior of its insect vector but also of their natural enemies, such as parasitoid wasps. Therefore, it is essential to understand how insects such as the predator ladybird beetle responds to volatiles emitted from a host plant and how the disease transmission alters the interactions between predators, vector, pathogens, and plants. In this study, we investigated the response of Propylaea japonica to volatiles from citrus plants damaged by Diaphorina citri and Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus through olfactometer bioassays. Synthetic chemical blends were also used to determine the active compounds in the plant volatile. The results showed that volatiles emitted by healthy plants attracted more P. japonica than other treatments, due to the presence of high quantities of D-limonene and beta-ocimene, and the lack of methyl salicylate. When using synthetic chemicals in the olfactory tests, we found that D-limonene attracted P. japonica while methyl salicylate repelled the predator. However, beta-ocimene attracted the insects at lower concentrations but repelled them at higher concentrations. These results indicate that P. japonica could not efficiently search for its host by using volatile cues emitted from psyllids- and Las bacteria-infected citrus plants. PMID:28083006},

	abstract = {Understanding intra-plant variations in δ15N is essential for fully utilizing the potential of δ15N as an integrator of the terrestrial nitrogen (N) cycle and as an indicator of the relative limitation of N and phosphorous (P) on plant growth. Studying such variations can also yield insights into N metabolism by plant as a whole or by specific organs. However, few researchers have systematically evaluated intra-plant variations in δ15N and their relationships with organ nutrient contents. We excavated whole plant architectures of Nitraria tangutorum Bobrov, a C3 species of vital regional ecological importance, in two deserts in northwestern China. We systematically and simultaneously measured N isotope ratios and N and P contents of different parts of the excavated plants. We found that intra-plant variations in δ15N of N. tangutorum were positively correlated with corresponding organ N and P contents. However, it was the N × P interaction, not N and P individually or their linear combination, that was the strongest predictor of intra-plant δ15N. Additionally, we showed that root δ15N increased with depth into soil, a pattern similar to profiles of soil δ15N reported by previous studies in different ecosystems. We hypothesized that the strong positive intra-plant δ15N–N and P relationships are caused by three processes acting in conjunction: (1) N and P content-driven fractionating exchanges of ammonia between leaves and the atmosphere (volatilization) during photorespiration, (2) resorption and remobilization of N and P from senescing leaves, and (3) mixture of the re-translocated foliar N and P with existing pools in stems and roots. To test our hypothesis, future studies should investigate plant N volatilization and associated isotope fractionation and intra-plant variations in δ15N in different species across ecosystems and climates.},

We found changes in the relative proportions of different classes of VOC in apical branches vs. apical bud galls. H. foliosus VOCs had mainly monoterpene hydrocarbons such as p-cymene, a recognized herbivore deterrent. We also found oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the H. foliosus volatile mixture. H. foliosus modifies its fragrance composition when parasitized by gall midges, showing an increased proportion of some monoterpene hydrocarbons, e.g. limonene and camphene, while others such as α-thujene, p-cymene and γ-terpinene were down-expressed in apical bud gall VOCs. We discuss these results considering gall signaling and chemical ecology hypotheses, including the potential role of plant defenses as well as gall midge-derived modification for host plant VOCs, and comment on the ecological relevance of our findings.},

Although several volatile chemicals emitted from tea plants have been reported to be attractive to E. obliqua moths, no synthetic attractants for E. obliqua moths have been developed. By measuring the behavioral responses of the moth to a series of chemicals in the lab, we found that a blend containing a ternary mixture containing (Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenyl hexanoate and benzyl alcohol clearly attracted to E. obliqua moths of both sex and that (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate could enhance the attractiveness of the ternary blend. Moreover, we found that the volatiles emitted from the plant-E. obliqua larva complex have the same attractiveness as: 1) the blend of volatiles containing the ternary mixture and 2) the blend containing (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate plus the ternary mixture to both male and female moths. In a field bioassay, more male moths were observed on traps that were baited with the blend containing (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate plus the ternary mixture than on control traps. Our study raises the tantalizing possibility that synthetic blends could be deployed as attractants for pests in the field.},

Position-dependent and morph-specific EAG responses were elicited in both species. The nepetalactol and nepetalactone isomers elicited large EAG responses at all three recording positions in males of both species, such that primary rhinaria as well as secondary rhinaria appeared to respond. Asexual female morphs showed relatively smaller EAG responses to these compounds. The secondary rhinaria, which have been reported as sex pheromone receptors in males, were not very different in their number and distribution between gynoparae and alate virginoparae, but the gynoparae showed significantly larger EAG responses to nepetalactol and nepetalactone. The alate virginoparae showed EAG responses that were similar to those of apterous virginoparae, which lack secondary rhinaria. Taking the EAG response profiles together with the distribution of the secondary rhinaria, it is suggested that the function of secondary rhinaria differs between the morphs. Secondary rhinaria appear to detect sex pheromone components in males and gynoparae but not in the alate virginoparae. If they are functional in the latter morph, they are likely to play a role in detecting specific, but as yet unknown, volatile compounds. Some 30 plant volatiles were tested but none evoked an EAG response that could be allocated to the secondary rhinaria. In contrast to the very different EAG response profiles to the pheromone compounds between morphs, EAG responses to (E)-2-hexenal were similar in all forms and both species. These findings suggest that this plant volatile was detected only by the two primary rhinaria, which are common to all morphs. The present study showed that EAG responses were not a simple summation of receptor potentials between recording and reference electrodes in aphids. The localised distribution pattern of olfactory receptor neurones around the recording electrode was also likely to contribute to the EAG responses.},

	abstract = {Plant-inhabiting predatory mites (Acari, Phytoseiidae) are important natural enemies of herbivorous mites and insects and globally used in biological control in diverse agro-ecosystems. Foraging predatory mites predominantly use chemical cues to find plants harboring prey, to locate prey patches within plants and to detect prey individuals within patches. While a great deal of research has been dedicated to the response of predatory mites to herbivore-induced plant volatiles, comparatively little is known about close range chemosensory orientation such as the response to kairomones emanating from prey bodies. We addressed this issue in the interaction between the predatory mite Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot and its prey Western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande. First, we assessed the predators’ innate response to polar and non-polar fractions of whole-body extracts of thrips, which were generated by four solvents, i.e. hexane (strongly non-polar), ethyl acetate (moderately non-polar), ethanol (moderately polar) and distilled water (strongly polar). The predators avoided the non-polar hexane extract, did not show a clear response to the ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts, and were strongly attracted by the polar water extract. Second, we evaluated the effects of early life experience with the aversive hexane and attractive water extracts on the foraging behavior of adult predators presented live thrips. The predators memorized which type of cue they had experienced early in life. Experience of the aversive hexane extract reduced, whereas experience of the attractive water extract enhanced, the attack likelihood and predation rate on thrips, relative to thrips extract-naïve predators. GC–MS analysis of the hexane extract revealed six major compounds, i.e. decyl acetate, dodecyl acetate, linolenic acid, pentacosan, heptacosane and an unidentified unsaturated acetate. Decyl acetate and dodecyl acetate are well known compounds released by thrips upon predation threat; whether the other four compounds convey any information to the predators is unknown. Our study provides evidence that polar and non-polar fractions of thrips’ chemical cues elicit opposite responses in foraging predatory mites. The finding that early learning of thrips chemical cues profoundly changes the predators’ foraging success later in life may be exploited to optimize biological control of thrips.},

	abstract = {Summary
Chrysomelidae are a taxon with an enormous plethora of highly specialised herbivorous species. The present study provides an overview of the knowledge available so far on cues guiding chrysomelids to locate a host plant. Host location behaviour will be addressed from different trophic perspectives. Cues from undamaged host plants are distinguished from cues released from damaged ones. The role of host plant cues is considered with respect to the surrounding vegetation and to the presence of competitors. Only very little is known on how enemies searching for prey influence a chrysomelid's choice for a plant. Finally, also the impact of phytopathogens on host location in Chrysomelidae is addressed. The pheno- and genotypic plasticity of chrysomelid host location behaviour might have facilitated pioneering new host plants. For a better understanding of adaptive evolution, we conclude that future studies on host plant location by chrysomelids need to address in addition to ecological and behaviourals aspects more intensively also the molecular questions of adaptation.
Zusammenfassung
Chrysomelidae (Blattkäfer) bilden ein Taxon mit einer enormen Fülle an hoch spezialisierten herbivoren Arten. Diese Studie bietet eine Zusammenstellung des verfügbaren Wissens über Signale, die Chrysomeliden zur Wirtpflanzensuche nutzen. Die Wirtsuche wird dabei auf verschiedenen trophischen Ebenen analysiert. Signale ausgehend von unbeschädigten Pflanzen werden unterschieden von Signalen beschädigter Pflanzen. Die Rolle von pflanzlichen Signalen wird auch im Kontext der umgebenden Vegetation und der Gegenwart von Konkurrenten betrachtet. Es ist nur wenig darüber bekannt, wie die Gegenwart von Fraßfeinden die Wirtspflanzensuche der Blattkäfer beeinflusst. Auch der Einfluss von Phytopathogenen auf die Wirtssuche von Chrysomeliden wird skizziert. Die große phäno- und genotypische Plastizität des Wirtssuchverhaltens von Blattkäfern könnte das Erobern neuer Wirtspflanzenarten erleichtert haben. Die bisher vorwiegend verhaltensbiologischen und ökologischen Studien zeigen, dass es für ein besseres Verständnis der adaptiven Evolution der Chrysomelidae in Zukunft von besonderer Bedeutung sein wird, auch auf molekularer Ebene die Anpassung von Blattkäfern an ihre Wirtspflanzen noch intensiver zu untersuchen.},

	abstract = {Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is one of the most important staple crops worldwide. It constitutes the major source of carbohydrates for millions of low-income people living in rural areas, as well as a cash crop for smallholders in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations predicts that cassava plantations will increase and production systems will intensify in the future, highlighting the need for developing strategies that improve the sustainability of production. Plant chemical defenses hold the potential for developing pest management strategies, as these plant traits can influence the behavior and performance of both pests and beneficial arthropods. Cassava plants are well-defended and produce a number of compounds involved in direct defense, such as cyanogenic glycosides, flavonoid glycosides, and hydroxycoumarins. In addition, volatile organic compounds induced upon herbivory and the secretion of extrafloral nectar act as indirect defense against herbivores by recruiting natural enemies. Here, cassava chemical defenses against pest arthropods are reviewed, with the aim of identifying gaps in our knowledge and areas of research that deserve further investigation for developing sound pest control strategies to improve sustainable production of this crop, and how these defenses can be used to benefit other crops. Cyanogenic content in cassava is also highly toxic to humans, and can cause irreversible health problems even at sub-lethal doses when consumed over prolonged periods. Therefore, the promotion of chemical defense in this crop should not aggravate these problems, and must be accompanied with the education on processing methods that reduce human exposure to cyanide.},

	abstract = {The Acari are of significant economic importance in crop production and human and animal health. Acaricides are essential for the control of these pests, but at the same time, the number of available pesticides is limited, especially for applications in animal production. The Acari consist of two major groups, the mites that demonstrate a wide variety of life strategies, i.e., herbivory, predation and ectoparasitism, and ticks which have evolved obligatory hematophagy. The major sites of chemoreception in the acarines are the chelicerae, palps and tarsi on the forelegs. A unifying name, the “foretarsal sensory organ” (FSO), is proposed for the first time in this review for the sensory site on the forelegs of all acarines. The FSO has multiple sensory functions including olfaction, gustation, and heat detection. Preliminary transcriptomic data in ticks suggest that chemoreception in the FSO is achieved by a different mechanism from insects. There are a variety of laboratory and field bioassay methods that have been developed for the identification and characterization of attractants but minimal techniques for electrophysiology studies. Over the past three to four decades, significant progress has been made in the chemistry and analysis of function for acarine attractants in mites and ticks. In mites, attractants include aggregation, immature female, female sex and alarm pheromones; in ticks, the attraction–aggregation–attachment, assembly and sex pheromones; in mites and ticks host kairomones and plant allomones; and in mites, fungal allomones. There are still large gaps in our knowledge of chemical communication in the acarines compared to insects, especially relative to acarine pheromones, and more so for mites than ticks. However, the use of lure-and-kill and lure-enhanced biocontrol strategies has been investigated for tick and mite control, respectively, with significant environmental advantages which warrant further study.},

The chemical cues were explored for both years: (1S)-(−)-β-pinene and (R)-(+)-limonene both clearly affected PPM egg-laying, reducing the number of egg masses per tree. Pine tree height and distance from the plantation's edge also proved to be influential, with highest trees, and trees closest to the plantation edge, having greater numbers of egg masses.

Plants represent an interesting example of phenotypic plasticity which also directly represents and affects the dynamics of biological interactions occurring in a community. Insects, which interact with plants, manifest phenotypic plasticity in their developmental, physiological, morphological or behavioral traits in response to the various host plant defenses induced upon herbivory. However, plant-insect interactions are generally more complex and multidimensional because of their dynamic association with their respective microbiomes and macrobiomes. Moreover, these associations can alter plant and insect responses towards each other by modulating the degree of phenotypic plasticity in their various traits and studying them will provide insights into how plants and insects reciprocally affect each other’s evolutionary trajectory. Further, we explore the consequences of phenotypic plasticity on relationships and interactions between plants and insects and its impact on their development, evolution, speciation and ecological organization.

	abstract = {Eight-carbon volatiles are characteristic of the odour profile of many filamentous fungi. They derive from enzymatic or non-enzymatic lipid oxidation and are thus termed volatile oxylipins. Collectively, non-volatile and volatile fungal oxylipins are important hormone-like factors that regulate the phenotypic status of a fungus, i.e. growth, morphological differentiation and secondary metabolite production. Given this intimate link between oxylipin formation and phenotypic change, we propose that the release of volatile oxylipins is an important means by which fungi may influence the course and outcome of interactions with animals. Such invertebrate – fungus interactions are intricate inter–kingdom relationships where either one depends on the other, or both on each other, where one is to the others benefit or detriment – eventually having even consequences on third parties and thus influencing whole foodwebs. In this review, we first highlight the connections between oxylipin formation and fungal phenotypic changes, how they affect invertebrate interactions and vice versa. We then expand this by implementing eight-carbon volatiles as infochemicals. Infochemicals are cues or signals perceived by the invertebrates' chemical senses, that are to the invertebrates' or the fungus’ benefit or detriment, through the behavioural responses they elicit. We point out, with various examples, that there is a strong analogy between fungus-invertebrate interactions mediated by fungal eight-carbon volatiles and plant-herbivore interactions mediated by six-carbon green-leaf volatiles released from wounded or stressed plants.},

The same engineered proteins may also find applications in the slow release of pheromones and other chemicals in the environment, as well as in the fine purification of drugs, including the resolution of racemates.

Since stimuli usually are nontoxic, either “push” or “pull” components, the strategy is usually companied by population-reduced methods, such as using insecticides, exploiting nature enemies, and placing traps. Among them, methods of biological control are the most preferred. The “push–pull” strategies maximize efficacy of behavior-modifying stimuli through the additive and synergistic effects of integrating the use of methods for population reduction. In this review, the principles of the “push–pull” strategy were firstly described, then the potential behavior-modifying stimuli for “push” and “pull” components were introduced. The stimuli for use in “push–pull” strategies primarily include visual cues and chemical cues (synthetic or plant- or insect-derived semiochemicals). Visual stimuli, repellent and trap plants, host and non-host volatiles, insect pheromones, and antifeedants and oviposition deterrents are usually applied as the potential stimuli in the “push–pull” strategy for pest control. The stimuli are grouped as long-range stimuli and short-range stimuli. In addition, we also summarize models of “push–pull” habitat management strategy, such as agriculture, horticulture and forestry, of pest control and some successful case studies in applying of “push–pull” strategy and its potential ecological benefits. The “push–pull” technology (PPT), so far the most effective “push–pull” strategy in practice by farmers, developed for management of both stemborers and Striga hermonthica in maize-based farming system in eastern Africa were reviewed. The PPT uses an intercrop of repellent plants and border crops of attractive trap plants. Stemborer moths are effectively repelled away from the maize crop (push) by Desmodium and molasses grass, and are subsequently attracted (or trapped) to (pull) by the Napier grass and Sudan grass which emit the green leaf volatiles (GLVs) showing attractant properties. Finally, the problems in current research and future perspectives of the “push–pull” habitat management strategy are discussed in the present paper.},

	abstract = {Wood borers are important forest insect pests and difficult to be controlled owing to their concealed behavior. However, parasitic wasps can effectively ascertain and parasitize wood borers as well as other concealed pests by using special searching, finding and attacking mechanisms, which have been developed during the course of long-term coevolution with their hosts. The present paper summarizes the behavioral mechanisms of parasitic wasps involved in searching and locating their concealed hosts. Parasitic wasps can accurately find the location of their hidden hosts and then parasitize them, usually by using olfactory semiochemicals from hosts (lavare and adults), host frass and symbiotic microorganisms in host galleries; visual signals from color contrast of plant surface; contact stimuli from characters of host physical defense; substrate vibrations produced by host feeding and movement; infrared radiation from host activities and metabolizability. Some parasitic wasps may integrate the information of several stimuli from different sources to enhance the reliability and accuracy of host locations. In addition, the potentials for utilizing the host location signals of parasitoids in biological control are discussed.},

Describing insects as survivors, these torch-bearers of extreme adaptations for survivorship could provide man the right cues and clues for efficient survivorship. The spectrum of ecologies that they have occupied on this planet provides them the status of unique adaptations. Their status as pests of benevolent ones to humanity is understood from a human perspective. The agricultural importance of insects relates to their depredation in crops and ectoparasitism in animals. These opportunistic associations of various genera and species of insects in annual crops and seasonal occurrence in perennial crops make for worrisome biotic stress, and farmers must invest more to secure crops and animals from these noxious insects. Alternatively, natural enemies of insects that parasitize or prey upon insect pests of crops or ectoparasites of animals shall be a boon to farmers to regulate and effectively suppress the pest increase and to efficiently manage crop yields. Crop pollination by a number of insect pollinators is the benefit by using biological pest control options by withholding toxic chemical insecticides from the crops. Enhancing crop pollination with natural insect pollination would be possible if biological pest management is adopted, by which synthetic chemical pesticides could be averted in crop husbandry.},

Here, we quantified (1) the effects of female age on the attraction of female melon fly, Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Diptera: Tephritidae) to volatiles emitted by intact and mechanically damaged tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), eggplant (S. melongena), zucchini (Cucurbita pepo), bitter melon (Momordica charantia), and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) fruit, and (2) the influence of time elapsed since fruit damage on the outcome. The investigations were conducted under semi-natural conditions in Hawai’i. Results from the first experiment revealed that, for freshly damaged tomato, eggplant, and zucchini, the level of female response was comparatively low and was not affected by female age. For bitter melon and cucumber, higher levels of response to freshly damaged fruit were documented, and the response levels gradually increased as female age increased from 1 to 4 weeks, reaching 70\% for 4-week-old females exposed to cucumber odor. Results from our second experiment indicated that, on average, 56\% of the females released responded in 20 min when cucumbers were freshly sliced, and the level of response was reduced 6-fold within a couple of hours. Females did not respond to tomato and cucumber odor when fruits were damaged {\textgreater}8 h before testing. Fruit volatiles involved in female Z. cucurbitae attraction seem to be released shortly upon mechanical damage and they are short-lived. The plasticity of the olfaction-driven behavior observed in Z. cucurbitae depending on female age and on the strength of the olfactory cues associated with preferred and less preferred hosts, adds another dimension to our understanding of the host-seeking behavior of this invasive species.},

	abstract = {Olfactory orientation by insects may be guided by specific volatile blends released from sites where resources are present. Such blends need to be recognized against the odorous background of the habitat. The egg parasitoid Closterocerus ruforum is known to be attracted to plant volatiles induced by egg deposition of its herbivorous host, the pine sawfly Diprion pini. The parasitoid has to detect this volatile signal against a background of other pine volatiles (i.e. odour from pine without host eggs). Previous studies have shown that attractive resource-indicating odour (pine with host eggs) and nonattractive habitat odour (pine without eggs) differ only by enhanced quantities of (E)-β-farnesene in the resource-indicating odour. However, (E)-β-farnesene per se was not attractive. We studied the relevance of quantitative ratios of (E)-β-farnesene and other pine volatiles present in the habitat for parasitoid orientation by electrophysiological methods (EAG) and behavioural (olfactometer) assays. Seven of 12 terpenoid pine volatiles elicited an EAG response. In tests of the parasitoid's behavioural response to EAG-active volatiles, a blend of five components (including (E)-β-farnesene) was sufficient to attract the parasitoid but only when the ratio of (E)-β-farnesene and the other compounds matched that in odour from egg-laden pine. Since the quantities of volatiles from egg-laden and egg-free pine are not significantly different except for (E)-β-farnesene, our results show that the quantity of a resource-indicating key compound (here (E)-β-farnesene) is validated by its ratio to quantities of background volatiles emitted by both the resource and the habitat.},

Observations in a wind tunnel demonstrated that G. haesitator females were attracted by larval frass of C. nigricana, wing scales of adult pea moths, and herbivore-induced plant volatiles of pea plants (HIPVs). Twenty-four volatiles emitted by those sources were identified, eight of which elicited antennal responses in the female wasps. Behavioural importance of these eight compounds was verified in the wind tunnel testing a synthetic blend for G. haesitator attraction. We also evaluated parasitoid species and rates of parasitism on overwintered pea moth cocoons in two pea-growing regions in Germany and Norway. The parasitism rates were as high as 29\% for G. haesitator, showing that this species is an important biological control agent of pea moth. Total parasitism in the regions was up to 71\%. The overall results are discussed considering applied aspects of pea moth management combining semiochemicals and conservation biological control strategies related to natural parasitoid populations.},

Previously, we cloned three PBPs from Spodoptera litura (Slit), and showed that SlitPBP1 is much more abundant than the other two, particularly in male antennae. To investigate the ligand specificity of SlitPBP1, we expressed the protein in a bacterial system and performed binding experiments with the three components of the specific sex pheromones (Z9-14:Ac, Z9,E11–14:Ac and Z9,E12–14:Ac), as well as with 26 volatile ligands. The results indicated that SlitPBP1 bound all three sex pheromone components with dissociation constants between 0.6 and 1.1μM. The same protein also bound with comparable affinities several pheromone analogs, but not plant volatiles. The presence of a double bond was the most important element for a strong binding, while its position and configuration also affected the affinity. Finally, the binding of pheromone components is strongly affected by pH, showing a critical pH value corresponding to isoelectric point of the protein. This suggests that a pH-dependent conformational mechanism might exist in SlitPBP1 for pheromone binding and release.},

	abstract = {Parasitoids are a significant mortality factor in the population dynamics of many arthropods involved in key ecological processes such as herbivore-plant and predator-prey interactions. Parasitoids are therefore widely used in biocontrol programs. Global change phenomena influence these natural and anthropocentric roles of parasitoids and here we review the effects of the main drivers and their interplay. Land use intensification modifies landscape structure and elevates agroecosystem loads of fertilisers and pesticides creating risks for parasitism and loss of biocontrol services. Climate change can affect parasitoids directly, affecting physiology and survival, or indirectly via phenological and other effects (plant chemistry, herbivore-induced plant volatiles HIPVs) on their hosts, endosymbionts and plants. Biological invasions have the potential to modify native host-parasitoid systems and elevate risk of novel pest dynamics, requiring restoration of biocontrol. The interplay between these global change drivers may thus exacerbate the overall risk to parasitism in future agricultural landscapes. To make more accurate predictions, future studies could focus on the impact of interacting global change drivers on parasitoids and the biocontrol services they provide. Moreover, host and parasitoid specificity appear to be a key driver in assessing the effects of global change on parasitoids.},

Competitive binding assays with 113 odorant chemicals indicated that HarmOBP5 has strong affinity to some special plant volatiles, including (E)-ß-farnesene, ethyl butyrate, ethyl heptanoate, and acetic acid 2-methylbutyl ester. Based on three-dimensional (3D) model of AaegOBP1 from Aedes aegypti, a 3D model of HarmOBP5 was predicted. The model revealed that some key binding residues in HarmOBP5 may play important roles in odorant perception of H. armigera. This study provides clues for better understanding physiological functions of OBPs in H. armigera and other insects.},

	abstract = {Plant immunity is modulated by several abiotic factors, and microbiome has emerged as a major biotic driver of plant resistance. Recently, a few studies showed that plants also modify resistance to pests and pathogens in their neighborhood. Several types of neighborhood could be identified depending on the biological processes at play: intraspecific and interspecific competition, kin and stranger recognition, plant-soil feedbacks, and danger signaling. This review highlights that molecules exchanged aboveground and belowground between plants can modulate plant immunity, either constitutively or after damage or attack. An intriguing relationship between allelopathy and immunity has been evidenced and should merit further investigation. Interestingly, most reported cases of modulation of immunity by the neighbors are positive, opening new perspectives for the understanding of natural plant communities as well as for the design of more diverse cultivated systems.},

In response to attack, plants evolved highly effective, inducible defense systems. Two plant hormones modulating inducible defenses are salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). Current thinking is that SA induces resistance against biotrophic pathogens and some phloem feeding insects and JA induces resistance against necrotrophic pathogens, some phloem feeding insects and chewing herbivores. Signaling crosstalk between SA and JA commonly manifests as a reciprocal antagonism and may be adaptive, but this remains speculative. We examine evidence for and against adaptive explanations for antagonistic crosstalk, trace its phylogenetic origins and provide a hypothesis-testing framework for future research on the adaptive significance of SA–JA crosstalk.},

	abstract = {Targeted livestock grazing is a proven tool for manipulating rangeland vegetation, and current knowledge about targeted livestock grazing is extensive and expanding rapidly. Targeted grazing prescriptions optimize the timing, frequency, intensity, and selectivity of grazing (or browsing) in combinations that purposely exert grazing/browsing pressure on specific plant species or portions of the landscape. Targeted grazing differs from traditional grazing management in that the goal of targeted grazing is to apply defoliation or trampling to achieve specific vegetation management objectives, whereas the goal of traditional livestock grazing management is generally the production of livestock commodities. A shared aim of targeted livestock grazing and traditional grazing management is to sustain healthy soils, flora, fauna, and water resources that, in turn, can sustain natural ecological processes (e.g., nutrient cycle, water cycle, energy flow). Targeted grazing prescriptions integrate knowledge of plant ecology, livestock nutrition, and livestock foraging behavior. Livestock can be focused on target areas through fencing, herding, or supplement placement. Although practices can be developed to minimize the impact of toxins contained in target plants, the welfare of the animals used in targeted grazing must be a priority. Monitoring is needed to determine if targeted grazing is successful and to refine techniques to improve efficacy and efficiency. Examples of previous research studies and approaches are presented to highlight the ecological benefits that can be achieved when targeted grazing is applied properly. These cases include ways to suppress invasive plants and ways to enhance wildlife habitat and biodiversity. Future research should address the potential to select more adapted and effective livestock for targeted grazing and the associated animal welfare concerns with this practice. Targeted livestock grazing provides land managers a viable alternative to mechanical, chemical, and prescribed fire treatments to manipulate rangeland vegetation.},

	abstract = {Entomopathogenic bacteria are commonly used as biological agents to control different insect pests. However, little is known about the role of bacterial entomopathogens as endophytes in regulating both plant growth and resistance against insect pests. Here, we applied the entomopathogenic bacterium Serratia marcescens S-JS1 via rice seed inoculation and evaluated its effects on host plant growth and resistance against the rice pest Nilaparvata lugens. Furthermore, the induction of defense-related secondary metabolites by the bacterium was assessed by GC–MS/MS. We showed that S-JS1 was able to endophytically colonize the roots and shoots of rice seedlings following seed inoculation. Colonized plants showed increased seed germination (9.4–13.3 \%), root (8.2–36.4 \%) and shoot lengths (4.1–22.3 \%), and root (26.7–69.3 \%) and shoot fresh weights (19.0–49.0 \%) compared to plants without inoculation. We also identified the production of indole-3-acetic acid by S-JS1, which is likely involved in enhancing rice plant growth. In a two-choice test, N. lugens adults preferred to feed on untreated control plants than on plants treated with S-JS1. In the no-choice feeding tests, the survival of N. lugens nymphs that fed on S-JS1-treated plants was significantly lower than that of nymphs that fed on untreated plants. Additionally, seeds treated with 109 cfu/mL S-JS1 resulted in elevated levels of secondary metabolites, which may be associated with N. lugens resistance in rice plants. Therefore, we suggest that the entomopathogenic bacterium S. marcescens be considered a potentially promising endophyte for use in an innovative strategy for the integrated management of insect pests.},

In particular, we model how the spatial and temporal patterns of the odour information emerging in the glomeruli of the antennal lobe (AL) rely on the glomerular morphology, the connectivity and the complex dynamics of the AL circuits. We study how weak signals can be amplified, how different odours can be discriminated, based on stochastic (resonance) dynamics and the connectivity of the network.

To determine the volatile compounds involved in this attraction, electroantennography (EAG) responses to seven synthetic volatiles released from vetiver plants were examined. Our results indicated that the responses of C. suppressalis adult antennae to the different compounds varied widely. The compounds elicited strong EAG responses in female antennae were subsequently selected for further EAG response tests, namely, caryophyllene, β-ocimene, linalool and α-pinene. EAG responses to a combination of these four compounds did not differ significantly from the individual compounds. However, pair combination tests indicated that 0.01 μg μL−1 linalool and 50 μg μL−1 α-pinene, 50 μg μL−1 caryophyllene and 0.01 μg μL−1 linalool, 0.01 μg μL−1 β-ocimene and 0.01 μg μL−1 linalool, and 0.01 μg μL−1 β-ocimene and 50 μg μL−1 caryophyllene elicited significantly greater EAG responses in 3-day female moths compared to the 1-day female.

Research in the last decade has started to disentangle the mechanisms underlying the insect-virus interaction, particularly focusing on the effects of the baculovirus infection in the host's physiology. Among crucial physiological functions, olfaction has a key role in reproductive tasks, food source detection and enemy avoidance. In this work, we describe that Spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV) induces expression changes in some odorant receptors (ORs) - the centrepiece of insect's olfaction - when infecting larvae from its natural host Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Different ORs are up-regulated in larvae after SeMNPV infection, and two of them, SexiOR35 and SexiOR23, were selected for further functional characterization by heterologous expression in empty neurons of Drosophila melanogaster coupled to single-sensillum recordings. SexiOR35 appears to be a broadly tuned receptor able to recognise multiple and different chemical compounds. SexiOR23, although correctly expressed in Drosophila neurons, did not display any significant response to a panel of 58 stimuli. Behavioural experiments revealed that larvae infected by SeMNPV exhibit altered olfactory-driven behaviour to diet when it is supplemented with the plant volatiles linalool or estragole, two of the main SexiOR35 ligands, supporting the hypothesis that viral infection triggers changes in host perception through changes in the expression level of specific ORs.},

We report that larvae of the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella are attracted to their natural sex pheromone and to their major component (Z)-11-hexadecenal, but only in a food context. For such task they use two general odorant-binding proteins (GOBPs), abundantly expressed in the three major sensilla basiconica of the larval antenna, as shown by whole-mount immunostaining and immunocytochemistry experiments. None of the three genes encoding pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs) are expressed at this stage. Both recombinant GOBPs bind (Z)-11-hexadecenal and the corresponding alcohol, but not the acetate. Binding experiments performed with five mutants of GOBP2, where aromatic residues in the binding pocket were replaced with leucine showed that only one or two amino acid substitutions can completely abolish binding to the pheromone shifting the affinity to plant-derived compounds. We hypothesise that detection of their species-specific pheromone may direct larvae to the sites of foraging chosen by their mother when laying eggs, to find better food, as well as to reduce competition with individuals of the same or other species sharing the same host plant. We also provide evidence that GOBP2 is a narrowly tuned binding protein, whose affinity can be easily switched from linear pheromones to branched plants terpenoids, representing a tool better suited for the simple olfactory system of larvae, as compared to the more sophisticated organ of adults.},

This chapter focuses on the olfactory communication between flowering plants and their insect pollinators taking into account the odor signal complexity, pheromone mimicry, and the evolution of chemical deception, and discusses examples of nonpheromonal odors important in plant–pollinator chemical communication. The chemical composition of floral odors is more complex than insect pheromones. The chapter discusses how behaviorally relevant “signal” may be extracted from chemical “noise” and distinguishes between the two major classes of flower-visiting animals. These animals range from those foraging for food and those performing reproductive functions, and contrast the odors that attract these animals to flowers. The floral odor signals like specific allelic combinations or novel phenotypes represent fitness peaks for their plants in an adaptive landscape, which is subject to various forms of natural selection. The chapter gives some examples of direct and deceptive odor signals representing distinctive peaks in the adaptive landscape of floral scent.},

An improved EAG technique is described and evaluated using alate virginoparae of the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae, and a series of plant volatiles. EAG recording with fine-tip glass electrodes inserted into the surface of the intact antenna of a whole insect preparation gave stable EAG peaks of a few mV and EAG peak amplitude decreased by only 22\% over an 8 hour recording period. The EAG responses showed typical dose-dependent characteristics. There was variation in EAGs from different preparations, so normalisation of the EAG responses against a standard stimulus is still necessary. The thirty compounds tested elicited an EAG response profile largely similar to that reported previously from excised antennae. EAG responses recorded with the electrode at three different positions, between the 5th–6th (A), 4th–5th (B), and 3rd–4th (C) antennal segments, were smaller when recorded closer to the head.

This protein family (CSPs) is also involved in many other systems that are not linked to olfactory receptors in olfactory sensilla. The brown planthopper (BPH) is a monophagous pest of rice that causes damage by sucking phloem sap and transmitting a number of diseases caused by viruses. In this study, fluorescence competitive binding assay and fluorescence quenching assay at acidic pH were performed as well as homology modelling to describe the binding affinity of NlugCSP10. Fluorescence competitive binding assay (FCBA) demonstrated that NlugCSP10 bound strongly to nonadecane, farnesene, and 2-tridecanone at acidic pH. The results of FCBA indicated that NlugCSP10 bound different ligands at the physiological pH (5.0) of the bulk sensillum lymph. Fluorescence quenching assay demonstrated that NlugCSP10 generated a stable complex with 2-tridecanone, while two ligands nonadecane and farnesene collided due to molecular collisions. The interaction of selected ligands with the modelled structure of NlugCSP10 was also analyzed, which found the key amino acids (Gln23, Gln24, Gln25, Asn27, Met33, Ser34, Ile35, Tyr36, Asn42, Met43, Val45, Asn46, Asn93, Arg96, Ala97, Lys99, and Ala100) in NlugCSP10 that were involved in binding of volatile compounds.

	abstract = {The distribution, fine structure and function of the sensilla present on the antennal club of Rhynchophorus palmarum were studied. No sex dimorphism was observed. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed five types of hair-like structures, four of which were evenly distributed on the antennal club. Two types of hair (IV and V) showed wall pores, a characteristic of olfactory sensilla. The antenna numbers 11,190 ± 3040 type IV and 7360 ± 1500 type V hairs. Using single sensillum recording, we identified 17 types of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) on the basis of their responses to pheromone and host plant odors, triggering synergic behavioral responses. We characterized highly specific and sensitive ORNs tuned to the aggregation pheromone (18\% ORNs; 0.01–1 ng response threshold) and to host plant odors such as ethyl acetate, ethanol, acetoin and guaiacol (10\% ORNs; 1–10 ng response threshold). Eleven percent of the ORNs were more generalist, responding to several odors with low sensitivity. Nine percent of the ORNs showed a complex pattern of responses, being co-activated by the pheromone and plant odors. This suggests an interaction at the sensory neuron level between pheromone and plant odors, triggering synergic behavioral responses.},

Animals may also be tempted to cheat by producing signals that mislead receivers into making decisions that benefit the sender. However, if a signal’s dishonest use increases sufficiently, receivers will be selected to ignore it, and the signaling system will collapse. The problem of signal honesty has become one of the most important issues in current studies of animal communication systems. This article reviews the history of evolutionary thinking about the question of whether animal signals provide reliable information, summarizes the signaling game-theoretic models that have described the conditions under which largely honest signals can persist, and presents some of the better examples of both highly reliable signals and cheating.},

In this review we highlight recent advances in this field focusing on both plant-driven and parasitoid-driven outcomes that flow up and down the trophic web, respectively. From the bottom-up, plant metabolites can impact parasitoid success by altering host immune function; however, few have considered the potential effects of other plant defense strategies such as tolerance on parasitoid ecology and behavior. From the top-down, parasitoids have long been considered plant bodyguards, but in reality the consequences of parasitism for herbivory rates and induction of plant defensive chemistry are far more complicated with cascading effects on community-level interactions.},

	abstract = {Plants can facilitate attraction of herbivore predators and parasites with herbivore-induced volatiles (HIPVs). However, a central unknown of manipulating a natural environment is how the interactive effects of multiple plant stressors impacts belowground multi-trophic interactions. Agricultural systems, while disturbed, are useful model systems for investigating the effects of multiple stressors on plants and their related interactions because of the redundancy of pests and pathogens and thus, the predictability of the species occurring in these environments. Chemical communication among plants and animals belowground remains behind analogous current understanding of terrestrial systems both fundamentally, and from an applied perspective. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) infect and kill insects with the aid of symbiotic bacteria and can serve a biological control function in agro-ecosystems. EPNs are known to respond to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that act as attractant cues increasing nematodes numbers in response to herbivory and concurrently increasing mortality of root pests. Microcosm and semi-field investigations have shown evidence that small scale numerical increases of EPN can be artificially caused by targeted applications or increases in HIPV production near the location of herbivore feeding. Community scale field experiments will be necessary to fully describe plant-herbivore-EPN interactions that also include other players such as plant parasitic nematodes (PPNs) and nematophagous fungi (NF), which may have unintended, negative consequences on plant production and natural enemy numerical response, respectively. Drawing upon the existing body of information on multi-trophic belowground communication, we propose development of a method to strategically and dynamically manipulate systems in a manner analogous to ‘tuning an audio mixer’ with hypothetical ‘knobs’ that could be adjusted by the user for human benefit. We suggest that biological control could be artificially up-regulated or down regulated by the action of a pest management practitioner using external forces such as HIPVs to regulate predator-prey interactions with the ultimate goal of sustainable plant production.},

Orchids are one of the most significant plants in ecologically adopted every habitation on earth.

Even though biochemistry of floral volatiles is still new field for investigation.Due to importance of the plant biology orchid floral scent research were deeply needed. Analysis of the biosynthesis mechanisms involved in floral scent is necessary to understand the fine-scale molecular functions and to breed to new cultivars through floral volatile genetic engineering approaches. Now a days many researchers developed floral scent models in plants. However, little is known about the pathways responsible for floral scent in orchids, due to the long life cycle and large genome size. Only some terpenoid pathways were reported in orchids. In this review, we mainly concentrated orchid floral volatile regulation and compounds synthesis responsible pathways.

The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between acceptance and suitability of six stemborer species attacking cultivated sorghum (C. partellus, Busseola fusca, Sesamia calamistis, and S. nonagrioides) or Napier grass (Busseola phaia and Sciomesa piscator) to C. flavipes. Although all stemborer species were equally accepted for ovipositor probing by C. flavipes, only C. partellus and S. calamistis were suitable and produced parasitoids. In olfactometric bioassays, C. flavipes females were more attracted to stemborer-infested than uninfested plants. Analyses of the volatile compounds showed that they produced richer volatile profiles, mainly comprising C5–C6 alcohols, terpenoids, aromatic and aliphatic compounds, than uninfested plants. It can be concluded that stemborer species, that were accepted for oviposition but were unsuitable for parasitoid development, form a reproductive sink and that the exotic parasitoid would not establish in areas where these are the predominant species.},

However, the respective importance of these phylogenetic signals in the host range of the parasitoid has been scarcely described. In this context, we evaluated the effect of phylogenetic (and taxonomic) signals of plants and host species on parasitoid host range (assessing parasitoid ability to produce offspring) in three aphid parasitoids (Aphelinus abdominalis, Aphidius ervi and A. rhopalosiphi) exposed to 16 plant-aphid complexes encompassing their ecological host range. The parasitoids were all categorized as oligophagous species and a phylogenic signal was detected in plant and aphid species phylogenies for A. rhopalosiphi and A. abdominalis host ranges, respectively. Aphelinus abdominalis specialized on aphids belonging to the Dactynotine subtribe and A. rhopalosiphi on species feeding on Poaceae. By contrast, no cluster was detected in the host range of A. ervi. Similar results were found when considering taxonomic signals, suggesting that taxonomic data are equally useful for assessing parasitoid host specificity. Identifying phylogenetic (or taxonomic) signals that dictate parasitoid host specificity could be useful for detecting non-target species at risk in the framework of classical biological control programs and targeting pest species in the context of such programs.},

The composition of these pheromones is summarized here for several species of weevil. Weevil aggregation pheromones often have multiple components and their effect can be synergized by the presence of host-plant volatiles. In this chapter, the uses of insect pheromones in integrated pest management are discussed.

Only anisole and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate were attractive to T. papilionis wasps when used separately in olfactometer experiments. The wasps showed a significant attraction to a blend of anisole and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate at a ratio of 25 μL/100 μL. There was no significant response to the other bled ratios of that combination of chemicals. Greenhouse studies showed that the wasps were not significantly attracted to anisole alone, but exhibited short-distance attraction to the above blend.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic global warming (AGW) represents a major threat to biodiversity at all levels of organization. Attendant changes with climate warming are abiotic effects such as changes in the duration and intensity of precipitation events, wind intensity and heat waves. Most importantly, AGW may unravel food webs by differentially affecting the biology and ecology of species involved in intimate interactions, where reciprocal selection forces are often strong. Amongst insects, plant–herbivoreparasitoid interactions fulfill this criterion, as many herbivores and parasitoids are highly specialized on specific food plants and hosts, respectively. Here, focusing on temperature-related effects of AGW, I discuss several potentially important eco-physiological herbivore and parasitoid responses to high temperatures. These include effects on plant traits such as volatile emissions and primary and secondary metabolism. In turn, how these will impact insect herbivores, their parasitoids, and thus trophic interaction webs is discussed. The possible direct metabolic effects of heat waves on insects are also described. I also argue that climate change does not affect biodiversity independently of other human-mediated environmental threats, including habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive species, and overuse of pesticides. Thus, the conservation of multitrophic interactions is critically dependent on reducing the impact of multiple anthropogenic stresses.},

Inducible defences allow plants to be phenotypically plastic. Inducible indirect defence of plants by attracting carnivorous enemies of herbivorous arthropods can vary with plant species and genotype, with herbivore species or instar and potentially with other environmental conditions. So far, inducible indirect defence has mostly been studied for simple linear food chains. However, ultimately, ecologists should address inducible indirect defence in a food web context, where more than one organism (different herbivores and pathogens) may attack a plant and where a plant that emits herbivore-induced volatiles is surrounded by other plants that emit odours that can mix with the herbivore-induced volatiles from the attacked plant. Evolutionary ecologists are interested in the costs and benefits of interactions between plants and their attackers. These may be investigated by comparing different plant genotypes. The best comparison is between plant individuals that differ in only a single or restricted number of known traits. Such genotypes are difficult to obtain by conventional methods. However, rapid progress in the study of mechanisms of plant-attacker interactions and in the field of molecular genetics and genomics provides new tools that can be exploited by ecologists. For instance, genomic knowledge on Arabidopsis thaliana and the availability of characterized mutants and transgenes that are altered in one or a restricted number of genes can be exploited to address functional aspects of inducible indirect defence. In this paper we review progress in the knowledge of mechanisms of inducible indirect defence of plants and its importance for investigating the functional aspects of plant responses to herbivorous arthropods. Finally we identify some of the ecological questions that can be addressed by exploiting mechanistic aspects of inducible indirect defence. Induzierbare Abwehr ermöglicht Pflanzen phänotypische Plastizität. Bei der induzierbaren indirekten Abwehr von Pflanzen gegen Herbivore werden carnivore Feinde der herbivoren Arthropoden angelockt. Diese indirekte Abwehrreaktion kann je nach Art und Genotyp der Pflanze variieren, je nach Art und Stadium der Herbivoren und potentiell auch mit anderen Umweltfaktoren. Bisher wurde induzierbare indirekte Abwehr zumeist in einfachen, linearen Nahrungsketten untersucht. Letztlich sollten Ökologen induzierbare indirekte Abwehr aber im Kontext von Nahrungsnetzen untersuchen und berücksichtigen, dass mehr als ein Organismus (verschiedene Herbivore und Pathogene) die Pflanze attackieren können. Weiterhin ist eine Pflanze, die durch Herbivorenbefall induzierte Düfte freisetzt, auch noch umgeben von anderen Pflanzen, die ebenfalls flüchtige Verbindungen abgeben, die sich mit den Düften der induzierten Pflanze mischen können. Evolutionäre Ökologen sind an den Kosten und Nutzen der Interaktionen zwischen Pflanzen und ihrer Angreifern interessiert. Kosten-Nutzen-Analysen können anhand eines Vergleichs verschiedener Genotypen durchgeführt werden. Am besten werden Pflanzenindividuen verglichen, die sich nur in einem oder einer sehr begrenzten Zahl von Merkmalen unterscheiden. Solche Genotypen sind aber mit konventionellen Methoden schwer erhältlich. Aber die schnellen Fortschritte sowohl bei den Studien der Mechanismen von Pflanzen-Angreifer-Interaktionen als auch in der Molekulargenetik und Genomforschung eröffnen neue Möglichkeiten, die auch von Ökologen genutzt werden können. Um funktionale Aspekte der induzierbaren indirekten Verteidigung zu analysieren, kann man z.B. die Kenntnisse zum Genom von Arabidopsis thaliana nutzen sowie die Verfügbarkeit bestimmter Mutanten und transgener Individuen von A. thaliana, die nur in einem Gen oder einer bestimmten Anzahl von Genen verändert sind. Diese Publikation gibt einen Überblick der Kenntnisse über die Mechanismen der induzierbaren indirekten Verteidigung von Pflanzen und ihre Bedeutung für Analysen funktionaler Aspekte der pflanzlichen Reaktionen auf herbivore Arthropoden. Abschließend verweisen wir auf ökologische Fragen, die man untersuchen kann, wenn man mechanistische Aspekte der induzierbaren indirekten Antwort nutzt.},

	abstract = {Vegetation complexity is characterized by two major traits, i.e., plant chemical and plant structural complexity. Plant species diversity strongly determines these traits. Furthermore, plant structures affect microclimatic conditions, which in turn influence the emission and dispersion of plant volatiles (e.g., chemical complexity). Plant volatile chemical complexity may significantly affect orientation of herbivorous and carnivorous arthropods. Therefore, the way in which plant chemical and plant structural complexity act “in concert” may influence foraging and mating success of arthropods, and thus, finally, community composition. This review emphasizes an integrative view on the relationship between plant species diversity, plant structural complexity, plant volatiles (chemical complexity) and their effects on arthropods. Three new hypotheses are raised, which predict possible relations between plant volatile complexity and plant species diversity: (1) saturation-, (2) step-by-step, (3) incoherence-hypothesis. We conclude that arthropod orientation in natural environments is strongly determined by the relationship between plant volatile diversity and plant species diversity. Furthermore, we emphasize that structural complexity of the vegetation affects plant volatile diversity and thus, arthropod orientation. We review available information on how insects actually respond to complexity during olfactory and visual search and ask for both laboratory and field studies to further unravel the mechanisms of interactions between vegetation traits and their impact on arthropod orientation.
Zusammenfassung
Die Vegetationskomplexität ist hauptsächlich durch zwei Komponenten charakterisiert: chemische und strukturelle Komplexität der Pflanzen. Beide Komponenten werden im Besonderen durch die Pflanzenartendiversität bestimmt. Darüber hinaus beeinflussen Pflanzenstrukturen die mikroklimatischen Bedingungen, welche auf die Freisetzung und Verteilung von Pflanzendüften und damit auf die pflanzliche Duftkomplexität (=Chemische Komplexität) einwirken. Die pflanzliche Duftkomplexität wiederum kann die Orientierung von herbivoren und karnivoren Insekten beeinflussen. Die Art und Weise, wie die chemische und strukturelle Komplexität der Pflanzen zusammen wirken, kann den Erfolg von Arthropoden bei der Nahrungs-, Eiablageplatz-oder Partnersuche und damit die Zusammensetzung der gesamten Arthropodengemeinschaft beeinflussen. Dieser Review beleuchtet integrativ die Beziehung zwischen Pflanzenartendiversität, struktureller Komplexität und chemischer Diversität der Pflanzen sowie ihrer Effekte auf Arthropoden. Dabei werden drei neue Hypothesen aufgestellt, die mögliche Beziehungen zwischen Pflanzenartendiversität, pflanzlicher struktureller Komplexität und pflanzlicher chemischer Diversität vorhersagen: (1) Sättigungs-, (2) Stufenmodell-, (3) Inkohärenz-Hypothese. Wir kommen dabei zum Schluss, dass die Orientierung von Arthropoden in natürlichen Umwelten durch den Zusammenhang von Pflanzenartendiversität und pflanzlicher Duftdiversität der Vegetation bestimmt wird. Es bedarf weiterer Untersuchungen in Labor und Freiland um die Mechanismen der Interaktionen zwischen diesen Merkmalen der Vegetation und ihrer Wirkung auf die Orientierung von Arthropoden aufzuklären.},

However, HIPVs can also affect the behavior of arthropod herbivores and possibly higher-order natural enemies, potentially complicating the use of HIPVs in biological control. The aim of our work is to understand the effects of one HIPV on the abundance of arthropods at three trophic levels. Of particular interest are effects on herbivores and enemies of natural enemies. A field experiment was carried out in turnip Brassica rapa L. (Brassicaceae) (cv. Green Globe). A randomized block design was used with a treatment of synthetic methyl salicylate (MeSA), and a control consisting of the crop alone. Yellow sticky traps were used for sampling aerial brassica pests, their natural enemies and fourth trophic-level natural enemies within the crop. Our results showed that the abundance of the diamondback moth parasitoid, Diadegma semiclausum Hellén (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), the brassica leafmining pest Scaptomyza flava Fallén (Diptera: Drosophilidae), and the lacewing parasitoid, Anacharis zealandica Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Figitidae), increased significantly in the MeSA-treatment compared with the controls. Significantly more D. semiclausum females were attracted to MeSA than were males. However, it still remains unclear whether it is MeSA and/or volatiles produced by induced host plants that are attractive to the arthropods. These results are highly relevant to potential future application of HIPVs in pest management, as the attraction of arthropods within ‘untargeted’ trophic-levels may disrupt trophic cascades and challenges the ideas that the deployment of synthetic HIPVs in pest management may enhance biological control.},

	abstract = {Two field experiments were conducted to assess whether a concept termed ‘attract and reward’ (A\&R) could enhance conservation biological control (CBC). In A\&R, a synthetically-produced herbivore-induced plant volatile (HIPV) (‘attract’) is combined with a floral resource (‘reward’). It is anticipated that the two will work synergistically, attracting natural enemies into the crop (‘attract’) and maintaining them within it (‘reward’). The study was conducted in Canterbury, New Zealand and the system consisted of brassica crop, commonly occurring brassica herbivores, their natural enemies and higher order natural enemies. The HIPV deployed was methyl salicylate (MeSA) and the floral resource was buckwheat Fagopyrum esculentum. The first experiment assessed the abundance of arthropods from three trophic levels and the second evaluated herbivore abundance, parasitism and hyper-parasitism rates. No synergistic effect of ‘attract’ and ‘reward’ was observed in either experiment. Populations of three parasitoids, one hoverfly and one lacewing from the third trophic level and a fourth trophic level lacewing parasitoid increased significantly in treatments with buckwheat. One hoverfly species was significantly more abundant in treatments with MeSA, but less abundant in treatments with buckwheat. The effect of MeSA on Diadegma semiclausum abundance depended on sex, with fewer males and more females being caught. Treatments with MeSA had significantly higher aphid parasitism rate. Combining MeSA and buckwheat could be beneficial because the two techniques increase the abundance of different natural enemies. Thus, these results indicate that A\&R has potential as a CBC technique, as long as any unwanted side effects can be managed.},

In this review, we discuss oviposition-site selection behavior by the Heteroptera, focusing on the particular traits of this taxon in comparison with the most studied holometabolous insects. This review takes a multitrophic perspective and focuses on three main factors affecting the behavioral ecology of oviposition-site selection in true bugs: (1) life-history characteristics of the bugs, including host-plant specialization and mobility of larvae; (2) plant characteristics, including morphology and induced responses to feeding and oviposition, and (3) interactions with natural enemies, including parasitoid foraging behavior and strategies of bugs to interfere with the activity of parasitoids. New insights to the “mother knows best” paradigm of the behavioral ecology of oviposition-site selection by insects are provided by comparing the oviposition decisions displayed by true bugs with those of the well-studied Lepidoptera. The review ends with the identification of questions to be addressed in future studies on the behavioral ecology of oviposition by insects.},

The noctuid Helicoverpa assulta is a typical polyphagous moth, regarded as a good model for studying the olfactory reception of plant volatiles. In this study, four full-length genes encoding odorant receptors HassOR24, HassOR40, HassOR41, and HassOR55 expressed in antenna in H. assulta were functionally characterized. The highly expressed HassOR40 was narrowly tuned to a few structurally-related plant volatiles: geranyl acetate, geraniol and nerolidol. By systematically analyzing responses of single neuron in both trichoid sensilla and basiconic sensilla using single sensillum recording, the specific neuron B in one type of short trichoid sensilla was found to be mainly activated by the same chemicals as HassOR40 with high sensitivity, and with no significant difference between male and female neurons. Thus, a clear “receptor-neuron” relationship in H. assulta was demonstrated here, suggesting that HassOR40/HassOrco are expressed in neuron B of short trichoid sensilla. The active tobacco volatile nerolidol, recognized by this receptor-neuron line, elicits significant behavioral attraction of both sexes in H. assulta adults. The results indicate that we identified a receptor-neuron route for the peripheral coding of a behaviorally relevant host volatile in H. assulta.},

Yet, the increasing literature on volatile-mediated interactions in the ground underpins the great importance of chemical signalling in this ecosystem and its potential in pest control. Here, we explore the ecology and physiology of these chemically based interactions. An evolutionary approach reveals interesting patterns in the response of insects to particular classes of volatile or water-soluble organic compounds commonly emitted by roots. Food web analyses reasonably support that volatiles are used as long-range cues whereas water-soluble molecules serve in host acceptance/rejection by the insect; however, data are still scarce. As a case study, the chemical ecology of Diabrotica virgifera virgifera is discussed and applications of belowground signalling in pest management are examined.

	abstract = {Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) are a group of microorganisms that have potential for replacing synthetic chemical pesticides. However, EPF virulence is often insufficient, and therefore adoption of EPF biopesticides has been relatively limited. Previous studies have shown that herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) promoted the virulence of Lecanicillium lecanii, and that extracellular proteases and chitinases are important virulence factors of entomopathogenic fungi. We therefore put forward the hypothesis that HIPVs promote L. lecanii virulence by inducing extracellular protease or/and chitinase activity. Lecanicillium lecanii was treated with tomato HIPVs induced by various numbers/densities of Bemisia tabaci, the effect of HIPVs on L. lecanii virulence and activities of virulence-related enzymes (extracellular proteases and chitinases) was analyzed. Changes in enzyme activities were confirmed by measuring the variations in Pr1 and Chit II genes expression of virulence-related enzymes under the influence of HIPVs. Finally, the correlation between virulence and virulence-related enzymes or genes was analyzed to explore the mechanism of promoting HIPVs in L. lecanii virulence enhancement. The results showed that volatiles produced by the tomato plants induced by 50 B. tabaci adults (50-HIPVs) significantly enhanced the virulence of L. lecanii. When exposed to both 50-HIPVs and L. lecanii, the mortality rate of B. tabaci reached 79.0\% within 7 days compared to 28.87\% in the control group. Additionally, 50-HIPVs significantly promoted the activity of chitinase and the relative expression of Chit II genes, which consequently increased by 62.74\% and 48.55\%, respectively. However, each group of HIPVs had no promoting effect on extracellular protease and Pr1 gene expression. Correlation analysis results showed that the virulence of L. lecanii is significantly correlated with the activity of chitinase and relative expression of Chit II genes. Thus, HIPVs induced virulence of L. lecanii by increasing chitinase activity. This study demonstrates important methods to enhance the virulence of L. lecanii. Moreover, from the perspective of chemical ecology, the findings provide theoretical support for field application of EPF, and also reveal the impact of HIPVs on EPF from a biochemical perspective.},

	abstract = {Electroantennogram (EAG) responses were recorded from alate fundatrigeniae (spring migrants), gynoparae (the winged female form that produces sexual females) and males, the three migratory forms of the damson-hop aphid, Phorodon humuli (Schrank). EAG responses of gynoparae and males showed typical dose response characteristics to (E)-2-hexenal, (−)-R-carvone, hexanenitrile and (1RS,4aR,7S,7aS)-nepetalactol, the sex pheromone of this species. The 34 plant volatiles elicited broadly similar EAG response profiles in the three migratory forms. Green leaf volatiles produced large responses in all forms; however, the relative order of responsiveness varied. EAG responses to isomers of the monoterpene carvone differed between forms, with males being most, and spring migrants least, responsive. The hop-plant volatile and aphid alarm pheromone, (E)-β-farnesene, evoked similar EAG responses in all forms. By contrast, males were most responsive to the three sex pheromone components, (−)-(4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactol, (+)-(4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactone and (1RS,4aR,7S,7aS)-nepetalactol. Males were no more responsive to their own sex pheromone, (1RS,4aR,7S,7aS)-nepetalactol, than to the other aphid sex pheromone components tested. Spring migrants and gynoparae also responded to the three sex pheromone components. This study indicates that migratory forms of P. humuli detect a wide range of volatile compounds, and that they are equally well-adapted for the detection of volatiles associated with host and non-host plants and with other species of aphid.},

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microtubing has been shown to absorb root SLMs selectively in low-disturbance setups, where analytes were extracted from the polymer with methanol. This technique was adapted to isolate SLMs that diffuse in the vapour phase in soil and sand and under various experimental parameters, extracting with a plug of diethyl ether pushed through the length of the silicon tubing. Moisture level had a substrate-dependent effect on the recovery rate of analytes that were applied as synthetic blends of known belowground SLM semiochemicals in the media. Higher amounts of two selected SLMs, (E)-caryophyllene and (−)-thujopsene, were extracted from sand, and increased polymer and solvent volume, as well as sampling duration, resulted in more of these two SLMs recovered by extraction. It was also shown that PDMS tubes lose no extraction capacity after repeated use. The signature compound (E)-caryophyllene was successfully isolated from the rhizosphere of maize plants infested with Diabrotica v. virgifera larvae by extracting the silicon tubing with diethyl ether. Because the tubes are preconditioned to reduce the presence of contaminants, such extracts can be directly analysed by GC and GC–MS and used in electrophysiological and behavioural assays. After further modifications, non-invasive, in situ PDMS probes can be developed that extract SLMs from plant rhizosphere for the study of belowground chemical ecology processes.},

Our objective here was to investigate the synergistic effect of host-derived attractive volatiles in attracting C. chinensis under laboratory and field conditions in Shanxi Province, China. We hypothesized that the ratio and concentration of volatiles derived from Vigna radiata play critical roles for C. chinensis in locating this host. Therefore, we collected and identified the volatiles of mungbean by using headspace collection and GC-MS. The effectiveness of different ratios and concentrations of two compounds (2-hexenal and benzaldehyde) that elicit C. chinensis searching behavior were examined in Y-tube olfactometer assays. The combination of 300 μg μL−1 2-hexenal and 180 μg μL−1 benzaldehyde loadings exhibited a synergistic effect on attracting C. chinensis (82.35\%). Compared to control traps, the adults were significantly attracted to traps baited with blends, and more attraction to females than males was found for blend traps in the field experiments. Our results suggest that blends of this specific concentration and ratio of benzaldehyde and 2-hexenal can be used in traps as attractants for C. chinensis monitoring and control in the field.},

Plants clearly have a long history of relationships with viruses that have shaped their evolution. In wild plants viruses are common but usually asymptomatic. In experimental studies plant viruses are sometimes mutualists rather than pathogens. Virus ecology is closely tied to the ecology of their vectors, and the behavior of insects, critical for transmission of many plant viruses, is impacted by virus–plant interactions. Virulence is probable not beneficial for most host–virus interactions, hence commensal and mutualistic relationships are almost certainly common, in spite of the paucity of literature on beneficial viruses.},

	abstract = {Butterflies and moths differ significantly in their daily activities: butterflies are diurnal while moths are largely nocturnal or crepuscular. This life history difference is presumably reflected in their sensory biology, and especially the balance between the use of chemical versus visual signals. Odorant Binding Proteins (OBP) are a class of insect proteins, at least some of which are thought to orchestrate the transfer of odor molecules within an olfactory sensillum (olfactory organ), between the air and odor receptor proteins (ORs) on the olfactory neurons. A Lepidoptera specific subclass of OBPs are the GOBPs and PBPs; these were the first OBPs studied and have well documented associations with olfactory sensilla. We have used the available genomes of two moths, Manduca sexta and Bombyx mori, and two butterflies, Danaus plexippus and Heliconius melpomene, to characterize the GOBP/PBP genes, attempting to identify gene orthologs and document specific gene gain and loss. First, we identified the full repertoire of OBPs in the M. sexta genome, and compared these with the full repertoire of OBPs from the other three lepidopteran genomes, the OBPs of Drosophila melanogaster and select OBPs from other Lepidoptera. We also evaluated the tissue specific expression of the M. sexta OBPs using an available RNAseq databases. In the four lepidopteran species, GOBP2 and all PBPs reside in single gene clusters; in two species GOBP1 is documented to be nearby, about 100 kb from the cluster; all GOBP/PBP genes share a common gene structure indicating a common origin. As such, the GOBP/PBP genes form a gene complex. Our findings suggest that (1) the lepidopteran GOBP/PBP complex is a monophyletic lineage with origins deep within Lepidoptera phylogeny, (2) within this lineage PBP gene evolution is much more dynamic than GOBP gene evolution, and (3) butterflies may have lost a PBP gene that plays an important role in moth pheromone detection, correlating with a shift from olfactory (moth) to visual (butterfly) communication, at least regarding long distance mate recognition. These findings will be clarified by additional lepidopteran genomic data, but the observation that moths and butterflies share most of the PBP/GOBP genes suggests that they also share common chemosensory-based behavioral pathways.},

The rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome contains about 50 genes encoding putative terpene synthases (TPSs). Here we report that two of the rice sesquiterpene synthase genes, OsTPS3 and OsTPS13, encode (E)-β-caryophyllene synthase and (E,E)-farnesol synthase, respectively. In vitro, the recombinant protein of OsTPS3 catalyzed formation of (E)-β-caryophyllene and several other sesquiterpenes, including β-elemene and α-humulene, all being components of inducible volatiles of rice plants. The transcript levels of OsTPS3 exhibit a circadian rhythm of fluctuation, and its expression was also greatly induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA). In addition, expression of OsTPS3 in transgenic plants of Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in emitting high quantities of OsTPS3 products. We also overexpressed OsTPS3 in rice plants which then produced more (E)-β-caryophyllene after MeJA treatment. Finally, we found that the MeJA-treated transgenic rice plants attracted more parasitoid wasps of Anagrus nilaparvatae than the wild-type. These results demonstrate that OsTPS3, an enzyme catalyzing the formation of volatile sesquiterpenes, plays a role in indirect defense of rice plants.},

An important component of this approach is conservation biological control. This approach encompasses a variety of management practices that protect natural enemy populations in the agro-ecosystem and enhance their fitness and ultimate impact on pests. It represents an alternative to dependence on pesticides which is associated with environmental damage and risks to human health. The interventions used to achieve conservation biological control are commonly based on managing vegetation patterns at the local scale (e.g. flowering strips that promote parasitoids by supplying nectar) or at wider scale (e.g., woodland to serve as donor habitat for natural enemies). Importantly, such vegetation management also offers scope to provide agriculture with additional ecosystem services as diverse as pollination and carbon sequestration. Despite these attractive features and the success of a small number of conservation biological control strategies, it remains underutilized. We identify as barriers to adoption the relative complexity of conservation biological control and challenges with economic evaluation, as well as perceptions and communication. Climate change is a challenge that will demand the development of flexible strategies that can respond to changes in pest distributions and/or food web structure.},

	abstract = {Floral hydrocarbons provide essential signals to attract pollinators. As soon as they are emitted to the atmosphere, however, hydrocarbons are destroyed by chemical reactions involving pollutants such as ozone. It is therefore likely that increased air pollution interferes with pollinator attracting hydrocarbon signals. To test this hypothesis, a Lagrangian diffusion model was used to determine the position of air parcels away from hydrocarbon sources and to estimate the rate of chemical destruction of hydrocarbons as air parcels moved across the landscape. The hydrocarbon compounds linalool, β-myrcene, and β-ocimene were chosen because they are known to be common scents released from flowers. The suppressed ambient abundances of volatile organic compounds were determined in response to increased regional levels of ozone, hydroxyl, and nitrate radicals. The results indicate that the documented increases in air pollution concentrations, from pre-industrial to present times, can lead to reductions in volatile compound concentrations insects detect as they pollinate flowers. For highly reactive volatiles the maximum downwind distance from the source at which pollinators can detect the scents may have changed from kilometers during pre-industrial times to {\textless}200m during the more polluted conditions of present times. The increased destruction of floral signals in polluted air masses may have important implications for both pollinators and signaling plants. When patches of flowers are further apart than the visual range of pollinators, such as in fragmented landscapes, the loss of scent signals may mean that pollinators spend more time searching for patches and less time foraging. This decrease in pollinator foraging efficiency will simultaneously decrease the pollinator's reproductive output and the amount of pollen flow in flowering plants.},

	abstract = {In the field, plants are attacked by several herbivore species both simultaneously and in isolation. Spatial variation in damage to plants by different herbivores may affect the search behaviour of parasitoid wasps, but the consequences of this variation for host–parasitoid interactions are still little understood. We examined the effects of multiple herbivory on the search behaviour of the parasitoid Cotesia glomerata. Reduced parasitism was found in a field tent experiment, when both the host small cabbage white, Pieris rapae, and the nonhost cabbage moth, Mamestra brassicae, were present on Brassica oleracea plants. When hosts and nonhosts occurred on the same or neighbouring plants, this reduction in parasitism was similar, but the underlying behavioural mechanisms were different. In wind tunnel bioassays, parasitoids were equally attracted towards plants infested by the two herbivore species but were more attracted to plants with both herbivore species than to plants with only one. Differences in arrival tendencies therefore could not explain the reduced parasitism in the tent experiment with mixed infestations. Experiments showed that parasitoids readily left nonhost patches, whereas leaving tendencies from mixed patches of hosts and nonhosts were the same as from pure host patches. Therefore, reduced leaving tendencies and reduced host encounters explained the lower parasitism rate in mixed infestations in the tent experiment. Our results show that the spatial context in which hosts and nonhosts attack plants determines the foraging efficiency of parasitoids, with consequences for host–parasitoid interactions.},

We measured the main soil chemical properties, soil microbial biomass, soil enzyme activities involved in carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur mineralization, and the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The results indicated that liming effectively neutralized the soil acidity in the long term and, in combination with no tillage, significantly increased soil microbial biomass and enzyme activities. Twenty-three VOCs were detected using the proton transfer reaction-time of flight (PTR-ToF) technique, and both liming and tillage changed the VOC emission patterns. The greatest difference in VOC emission pattern was observed between no-tilled un-amended soils and tilled lime-amended soils, suggesting the activation of different metabolic pathways within the microbial communities of soils under different management. Differences in VOC emission patterns could be attributed to the decomposition of carbohydrates, which were also sustained by the higher enzyme activities in the lime-amended soils.},

Newly emerged female moths of Spodoptera littoralis were placed singly in jars with either leaves of the host plant, Ricinus communis or leaves of a non-host plant, Adhatoda vasica. The timing and duration of first calling were observed. Females kept with R. communis (Rc) leaves started calling significantly earlier, whereas those kept with A. vasica (Av) leaves started calling significantly later, than the control females, which were kept without any plant leaves. The duration of first calling was also significantly longer in the presence of Rc leaves than in the presence of Av leaves. The time of calling into the scotophase was advanced with age in control females and in the females given the host leaves, but not in females kept with the non-host leaves. The timing and duration of first mating were also observed in moth pairs in the presence of Rc or Av leaves. The moths exhibited significantly delayed mating when Av leaves were supplied, compared to both control moths and moths given Rc leaves. The duration of first mating was not affected by the presence of the non-host leaves, whereas it was significantly longer in moths given the host leaves. The average number of matings acquired by a moth, given one partner throughout the lifetime was significantly higher in the presence of host leaves, compared to non-host leaves or control conditions. Both fecundity and egg viability were significantly reduced, and the female longevity increased, in the presence of non-host leaves. These negative effects of Av leaves imply the possibility of utilizing the plant in pest management.
Zusammenfassung
Frisch geschlüpfte Spodoptera littoralis Weibchen wurden einzeln in Behälter mit Blättern der Wirtspflanze Ricinus communis oder Blättern der Nicht-Wirtspflanze Adhatoda vasica plaziert. Der Zeitpunkt und die Dauer des ersten Lockrufs wurden gemessen. Im Vergleich zu Kontrollweibchen ohne jegliche Blätter begannen Weibchen in Behältern mit R. communis signifikant früher mit dem Rufen, Weibchen in Behältern mit A. vasica signifikant später. Auch die Ruflänge in Gegenwart von R. communis Blättern war signifikant länger als in Gegenwart von A. vasica Blättern. In einer Folge von Skotophasen begannen Weibchen auf Wirtsblättern und Kontrollweibchen zunehmend früher mit dem Rufen, nicht jedoch die Weibchen auf Nichtwirtsblättern. Auch der Zeitpunkt und die Dauer der ersten Verpaarung wurden in Anwesenheit von R. communis oder A. vasica Blättern bestimmt. In Gegenwart von A. vasica Blättern erfolgten Verpaarungen signifikant später als in Gegenwart von R. communis Blättern oder bei den Kontrollpaaren. Die Dauer der ersten Verpaarung wurde durch die Anwesenheit von Nichtwirtsblättern nicht beeinflußt, jedoch war sie signifikant länger mit Wirtsblättern. Die durchschnittliche Anzahl Verpaarungen einer Motte in ihrer Gesamtlebensdauer, unter Bereitstellung eines Partners, war in Gegenwart von Wirtsblättern signifikant höher als bei den anderen beiden Gruppen. In Gegenwart von Nicht-Wirtsblättern war die Lebensdauer signifikant erhöht, Fekundität und Ei-Vitalität signifikant reduziert. Die negativen Effekte von A. vasica Blättern können möglicherweise im Pflanzenschutz genutzt werden.},

(E)-β-Caryophyllene is a sesquiterpene compound widely distributed in plants and functions in plant defence. However, little is known about the sequence and function of (E)-β-caryophyllene synthase in lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus). Here, we report a new full-length cDNA (PlCAHS) encoding (E)-β-caryophyllene synthase, a possible key enzyme of plant defence. The cDNA of PlCAHS contains an open reading frame of 1 761 bp, encoding a protein of 586 amino acids with a predicted mass of 67.95 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence shows 52\% identity with sesquiterpene synthase MtCAHS of Medicago truncatula. Based on phylogenetic analysis, PlCAHS is classified as the terpene synthases (TPS)-a subfamily. The recombinant enzyme, expressed in Escherichia coli, catalysed the formation of a major product (E)-β-caryophyllene (82\%) and a minor product α-humulene (18\%) from farnesyl diphosphate. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis found that the PlCAHS transcript was significantly up-regulated in leaves after treatment with spider mites and alamethicin (ALA), suggesting its ecological function in plant defence.},

	abstract = {Trees are large organisms that structure forest ecosystems by providing an environment for an enormous diversity of animal, microbial and plant species. As these species use trees as their common hosts, many are likely to interact with each other directly or indirectly. From studies on herbaceous plant species we know that microbes can affect the interaction of plants with herbivorous insects, for example via changes in plant metabolite profiles. The consequences of fungal colonization for tree-insect interactions are, however, barely known, despite the importance of these ecological communities. In this review we explore the interaction of leaf-inhabiting pathogenic and endophytic fungi with trees and the consequences for tree-living insect herbivores. We discuss molecular, physiological, chemical, biochemical and ecological aspects of tree-fungus interactions and summarize the current knowledge on the direct and indirect effects of tree-inhabiting fungi on insect herbivores. Our mechanistic understanding of the tripartite interaction of trees with leaf-inhabiting fungi and insect herbivores is still in its infancy. We are currently facing substantial drawbacks in experimental methodology that prevent us from revealing the effect of one single fungal species on a particular insect herbivore species and vice versa. Future studies applying a versatile tooleberbox of modern molecular, chemical analytical and ecological techniques in combined laboratory and field experiments will unequivocally lead to a better understanding of fungus-tree-insect interactions.},

In a previous study, uninfested wheat kernels and their hexane extracts were shown to be attractive to the adult wasps. To contribute to the understanding of the olfactory basis of the host-habitat recognition, the electroantennographic (EAG) responses of both sexes of T. elegans to a range of volatile compounds previously identified from grains of various cereals were recorded. All compounds tested elicited measurable EAG responses. The largest EAG amplitudes were evoked by 2-octanone, 1-hexanol, 2-heptanone, (E)-2-nonenal, decanal, (E)-2-hexenal, propionic acid, (E)-2-octenal and hexanoic acid in males, and by propionic acid, 2-hexanone, (E)-2-heptenal, 2-heptanone, hexanal, (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal, butanal, hexanoic acid and octanal in females. Aromatic compounds were the weaker antennal stimulants in both sexes. Sexual differences in the EAG amplitude to some compounds were found, with males being significantly more responsive to 13 of the 34 compounds tested. Comparison of EAG responses to various chemicals indicated a strong antennal capability to differentiate in respect to structure (aliphatics and aromatics), carbon chain length, functional group (acid, alcohol, aldehyde, ketone) and absence/presence of double bonds (saturated, mono- and di-unsaturated compounds). Possible roles of cereal volatiles in host-habitat location of T. elegans are discussed in relation to the possible future implementation of T. elegans-based biological control strategies.},

	abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may contribute to plant protection against pathogens. However, AM-fungal bioprotection may depend upon AM-fungal species identity and plant-pathosystem. Here, the aim is to determine if AM-fungal composition can alter Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinia’s (Psg) effect on soybean (Glycine max). Two experiments were performed simultaneously. The first experiment assessed the effect of soil treatment on pathogen (Psg) growth. While the second experiment assessed the interactive effects of Psg and soil treatment on soybean growth. In the first experiment, mycorrhizal composition and soil nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) were manipulated for Glycine max under growth chamber conditions. Mycorrhizal treatments included four single species of AM-fungi (Entrophospora infrequens, Funneliformis mosseae, Claroideoglomus claroideum, and Racocetra fulgida) and a mix (Fungal Community) of all four species. Three nutrient addition treatments included nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and nitrogen with phosphorous (NP). Psg colonization was assessed at 40 and 120h post infection (HPI). In the second experiment, also under growth chamber conditions, soybean biomass in response to the interactive effect of Psg and soil environments (AM-fungal community, N, P, NP, and control) was assessed after a four month growing season. AM-fungal species Entrophospora infrequens reduced Psg colonization, while three other fungal species did not (F. mosseae, C. claroideum, and R. fulgida). Addition of supplemental nitrogen inhibited Psg colonization, suggesting a resource provisioning mechanism of AM-fungal bioprotection. Assessment of plant growth revealed that an AM-fungal inoculum mix increases soybean leaf mass over a four month growing period. Meanwhile, Psg markedly increased stem mass. An interaction between AM-fungi and Psg on plant growth was not detected. In mixed communities, AM-fungal sporulation was only detected for a single species (F. mosseae). These findings provide insight onto the role of AM-fungal identity in bioprotection against a foliar pathogen. Although additional work is needed to fully determine ecological processes that provide selective advantages to host plant, these findings indicate that such ecological processes include nutrient provisioning and competition among AM-fungi. Together, these processes may have an underlying role in bioprotection.},

We identified and characterized four terpene synthases (PtTPS1–4) from P. trichocarpa which form major terpene compounds of the volatile blend induced by gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) feeding. The enzymes were heterologously expressed and assayed with potential prenyl diphosphate substrates. PtTPS1 and PtTPS2 accepted only farnesyl diphosphate and produced (−)-germacrene D and (E,E)-α-farnesene as their major products, respectively. In contrast, PtTPS3 and PtTPS4 showed both mono- and sesquiterpene synthase activity. They produce the acyclic terpene alcohols linalool and nerolidol but exhibited opposite stereospecificity. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of the respective terpene synthase genes was induced after feeding of gypsy moth caterpillars.

Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are a group of non-heme, iron-containing enzymes and extensively involved in plant growth and development, ripening and senescence, stress responses, biosynthesis of regulatory molecules and defense reaction. In our previous study, 18 LOXs in melon genome were screened and identified, and five 13-LOX genes (CmLOX08, CmLOX10, CmLOX12, CmLOX13 and CmLOX18) were predicted to locate in chloroplast. Phylogenetic analysis result showed that the five genes have high homology with jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis-related LOXs from other plants. In addition, promoter analysis revealed that motifs of the five genes participate in gene expression regulated by hormones and stresses. Therefore, we analyzed the expressions of the five genes and LOX activity in leaves of four-leaf stage seedlings of oriental melon cultivar Yumeiren under abiotic stress: wounding, cold, high temperature and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and signal molecule treatments: methyl jasmonate (MeJA), abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA). Real time qPCR revealed that wounding and H2O2 induced the expressions of all the five genes. Only CmLOX08 was induced by cold while only CmLOX13 was suppressed by high temperature. ABA induced the expressions of CmLOX10 and CmLOX12 while inhibited CmLOX13 and CmLOX18. MeJA increased the 3 genes expressions except CmLOX08 and CmLOX13, whereas SA decreased the effect, apart from CmLOX12. All the abiotic stresses and signal molecules treatments increased the LOX activity in leaves of oriental melon. In summary, the results suggest that the five genes have diverse functions in abiotic stress and hormone responses, and might participate in defense response. The data generated in this study will be helpful in subcellular localization and transgenic experiment to understand their precise roles in plant defense response.},

We were able to address 23 olfactory glomeruli, functional subunits of the antennal lobe, in each individual female. Next, we studied the relevance of the same odorants with two-choice experiments (odorant versus solvent) in a wind tunnel. Depending on odorant identity, naive moths made attempts to feed or to oviposit at the scented targets. A correlation of wind tunnel results with glomerular activation patterns revealed that feeding and oviposition behaviors are encoded in the moth’s antennal lobe by the activation of distinct groups of glomeruli.},

Plants use volatile compounds in general, and terpenes in particular, to attract pollinators to their flowers and to ward off, directly or indirectly, harmful insect, animal, and microbial pests. We have shown that the Arabidopsis model system is as useful for the study of terpene biosynthesis and emission as it is for so many other areas of plant biology. The availability of the sequence of the entire Arabidopsis genome has allowed us to identify the complete TPS gene family, and to begin to correlate the emission of specific terpenes with the expression of specific AtTPS genes. With the modern tools available for experimentation in Arabidopsis, this model organism constitutes the best system to elucidate the mechanisms regulating the processes of plant-insect interaction via volatiles, which operate in both the vegetative and the reproductive parts of the plants.},

	abstract = {The rice bug, Leptocorisa acuta (Tunberg) (Hemiptera: Alydidae), is a notorious pest in Asia, and it is significantly attracted by the volatiles derived from host plants. However, it remains unknown how L. acuta recognizes host volatile compounds at the molecular level. Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are thought to be responsible for the initial biochemical recognition during olfactory perception. Here, we followed the RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) approach to identify candidate genes encoding OBPs and CSPs from dissected antennae and mouthparts of L. acuta. In total, 26 unigenes were identified coding for OBPs (22 Classic OBPs and four Plus-C OBPs), and 17 unigenes coding for CSPs. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) revealed that 11 OBPs (LacuOBP1, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 20 and 23) and nine CSPs (LacuCSP2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 12) were predominantly expressed in antennae, indicating that they might be essential for detection of general odorants and pheromones. Among these antennae-predominantly expressed genes, LacuOBP11 and LacuOBP13 showed male-biased expression and therefore may play crucial roles in the detection of sex pheromones. Seven LacuOBPs (LacuOBP4, 8, 10, 12, 21, 25 and 26) and two CSPs (LacuCSP7 and LacuOBP11) were predominantly expressed in mouthparts, suggesting that these genes might be involved in taste perception. Our work provides a starting point to facilitate functional study of these OBPs and CSPs in L. acuta at the molecular level in the future.},

Twenty-two electrophysiologically active compounds were located by GC-EAD in the extract of plant samples taken before the rains, while extracts from plant samples taken after the rains contained 12 such active components.

In a first part of this chapter, we review how plant quality affects both female and male life history traits and their respective reproductive success, and how the production and transfer to females of male sperm and associated nongametic substances (spermatophores as nuptial gifts) also depend on the host plant choice. At first glance, it seems that reproductive traits in phytophagous insects should be selected to maximize the success of this short-term interaction between host plant and phytophagous insects. This, however, ignores the fact that variation in reproductive success is detrimental to long-term fitness, which may explain that reproductive traits depart from their short-term expectation in unpredictable environments. Bet-hedging strategies – as exemplified by spatial or temporal dispersal (e.g., prolonged diapause) – can therefore evolve in such environments, as described in the second part of this chapter. The knowledge reviewed in this chapter is also integrated in the broader applied perspective of insect pest population management.},

Odorant binding proteins (OBPs) are believed to be important for transporting semiochemicals through the aqueous sensillar lymph to the olfactory receptor cells within the insect antennal sensilla. No previous study has reported on OBPs in A. hispinarum. In this study, we conducted the large-scale identification of OBP genes from the antennae of A. hispinarum by using transcriptome sequencing. Approximately 28.4 million total raw reads and about 27.3 million total clean reads were obtained, and then 46,363 unigenes were assembled. Of these unigenes, a total of 21,263 can be annotated in the NCBI non-redundant database. Among the annotated unigenes, 16,623 of them can be assigned to GO (Gene Ontology). Furthermore, we identified 8 putative OBP genes, and a phylogenetic tree analysis was performed to characterize the 8 OBP genes. In addition, the expression of the 8 OBP genes in different A. hispinarum body tissues was analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results indicated that the 8 OBP genes were expressed accordingly to sexes and tissues, but all highly expressed in antennae. The finding of this study will lay the foundation for unraveling molecular mechanisms of A. hispinarum chemoperception.},

The furfural emission in this chamber was monitored simultaneously by an online mass-spectrometer.

The responses of Pieris brassicae L. larvae to superparasitism were examined in order to elucidate the ecological significance of this behaviour. Models of tritrophic interactions often imply that attraction of herbivore natural enemies by the plant constitutes a defence. Parasitoid attack on herbivores is assumed to result in a reduction in herbivory and or an increase in plant fitness. Coupled with the active involvement of the plant in producing signals, this can be seen as an indirect mediation of wound induced defence. The results show that superparasitism of P. brassicae by the parasitoid C. glomerata reduced survivorship but increased food consumption and weight growth in P. brassicae larvae. The duration of host larval development was found prolonged as the number of oviposition increased and superparasitized larvae (three to five time parasitized) grew slower than unparasitized larvae or larvae parasitized one or two times.},

In this chapter, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the positive, regulatory roles played by viruses in the environment, as well as the surprising beneficial outcomes derived from some virus–host interactions. A different view of viruses is emerging and more and more studies on the relationships between cellular organisms and the viruses that infect them challenge the portrayal of viruses as only infectious agents of disease. Viruses, without the intervention of human-devised strategies, regulate biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and trace elements, they help cellular organisms cope with abiotic agents of stress; and in some instances, they keep other viruses and cellular pathogens under check. Even more, viruses appear to have shaped the many ways prokaryotes and eukaryotes have changed over time; they have contributed to the emergence of new traits thanks to the exaptation of genes (and hence, proteins) of viral origin. There is a world of yet unknown viruses; forthcoming exploration of viruses across all ecosystems promises to provide further insight into the many dimensions of virus–host relationships.},

However, little is known about the fate of bird-derived nutrients that return to the marine environment and potentially concentrate below the colonies. To attempt to assess the influence of this potential nutrient enrichment of the coastal benthic community, samples of macroalgae, sea urchins (mainly algivores), and hermit crabs (scavengers) were collected at two Arctic localities (Spitsbergen), (1) below a mixed colony of guillemots and kittiwakes, and (2) in an adjacent geomorphologically similar location not influenced by the seabird colony. A much higher nitrogen stable isotope ratio (δ15N) and total nitrogen content were found in terrestrial plants sampled below the colony than away from it. In benthic macroalgae, however, there were no δ15N differences. This might result from the timing of an intensive growth period in macroalgae in late winter/early spring, when there is little or no runoff from the land, and/or ornithogenic nutrients being directly incorporated by phytoplankton. Sea urchins showed higher δ15N and total N in the control site comparing to the colony-influenced area, suggesting differential food sources in their diet and a role of scavenging/carnivory on higher trophic levels there. Opportunistically feeding hermit crabs showed δ15N and total N enrichment below the seabird colony, suggesting dependence on detritus derived from food chains originating from pelagic producers. Our results indicate that seabirds in the Arctic may fertilize coastal benthic communities through pelagic–benthic coupling, while having no direct impact on bottom primary production.},

	abstract = {Although induced defenses are widespread in nature, and a potentially important strategy used by invasive plants, it is unclear how induced defenses vary among populations and whether the intensity and duration of induced defenses depends on herbivore type. For invasive plants, low herbivore loads in their introduced ranges can lead to differences in herbivore defense compared to their native ranges, but we currently know little about how induced defenses vary among native and invasive populations. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to examine variation in one type of induced defense, extrafloral nectar (EFN) production, among native and invasive populations of Chinese tallow tree, Triadica sebifera. We experimentally manipulated herbivory from an exotic generalist scale insect, a native generalist caterpillar, both herbivores, or neither and then examined EFN production by Triadica. Damage from leaf-chewing caterpillars resulted in strongly induced EFN in both native and invasive populations while damage from phloem-feeding scales did not. Extrafloral nectar production and dissolved solute content peaked 4 days after caterpillar herbivory for both native and invasive populations. Number and proportion of leaves producing EFN, EFN volume and concentration of dissolved solutes were similar among native and invasive populations. These results suggest that selection for indirect defenses may be different than selection for other defenses in the introduced ranges of invasive plants, as constitutive and induced EFN production is retained in invasive populations.
Zusammenfassung
Obwohl induzierte Abwehr in der Natur weit verbreitet ist und eine potentiell wichtige Strategie von invasiven Arten darstellt, ist unklar, wie induzierte Abwehr zwischen Populationen variiert und ob die Intensität und Dauer der induzierten Abwehr von der Art des Herbivoren abhängen. Bei invasiven Arten kann geringe Belastung durch Herbivoren im Einwanderungsgebiet zu Unterschieden in der Herbivorenabwehr verglichen mit dem Ursprungsgebiet führen, aber wir wissen gegenwärtig wenig darüber, wie induzierte Abwehr zwischen einheimischen und invasiven Populationen variiert. Wir führten ein Gewächshausexperiment durch, um die Variation bei einer Art der induzierten Abwehr, der Produktion extrafloraler Nektarien (EFN), bei einheimischen und invasiven Populationen des Chinesischen Talgbaumes, Triadica sebifera, zu untersuchen. Wir ließen den Befall durch eine exotische, generalistische Schildlaus, eine einheimische, generalistische Schmetterlingsraupe, beide Herbivoren oder keinen zu und untersuchten dann die EFN-Bildung. Beschädigung durch die blattfressenden Raupen induzierte sowohl bei den einheimischen als auch bei den invasiven Populationen eine starke EFN-Bildung, während dies beim Befall durch Schildläuse nicht der Fall war. Die Bildung von EFN und der Gehalt gelöster Inhaltsstoffe erreichten vier Tage nach dem Raupenbefall einen Spitzenwert bei einheimischen und invasiven Populationen. Auch die Anzahl und der Anteil EFN-produzierender Blätter, das Nektarvolumen und die Konzentration der Inhaltsstoffe waren bei einheimischen und invasiven Populationen ähnlich. Diese Ergebnisse legen nahe, dass sich die Selektion auf die indirekte Abwehr im Invasionsgebiet von der Selektion auf andere Abwehrformen unterscheiden könnte, da konstitutive und induzierte EFN-Bildung in den invasiven Populationen erhalten bleibt.},

Two identical sampling units, named target and reference bulb, are therefore incorporated into the system and consecutively analyzed in monitoring experiments. A number of precautions were considered during these experiments to avoid the application of unwanted stress onto both organisms. Firstly, the system is constructed in such a way that both bulbs are continuously flushed, i.e. before, during and after analysis, with high purity air to avoid any accumulation of emitted volatiles. Moreover, the air is pre-humidified by bubbling it through water to sustain the biological samples for longer periods in the in vitro environment. Sorptive enrichment on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was used to trap the headspace volatiles. The hydrophobic nature of this material permitted easy removal of trapped moisture by direct flushing of the sampling cartridge with dry air before desorption. The system was used to monitor the emissions from in vitro mechanically wounded ivy (Hedera helix) and of in vitro grown tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) upon cotton leafworm (Spodoptera littoralis) feeding. Differences in light and dark floral emissions of jasmine (Jasminum polyanthum) were also studied.},

Thus, exploitation of the information may occur, to the detriment of the plant, leading to costs in addition to benefits.

The heated transfer line is used to prevent condensation of various chemicals in the capillary that would otherwise occur at room temperature. Construction of such a transfer line heater is described using (80/20\%) nickel–chromium heating wire wrapped in a helical coil and powered by a 120/220V ac rheostat.

The coil attributes (radius, width, number of loops, or length of each loop) are input by the user, as well as AWG size of heating wire and desired heater temperature. The program calculates total length of wire in the helix, resistance of the wire, amperage used, and the voltage to set the rheostat.

The ability of a generalist parasitoid to locate different non-related host species by volatile cues was examined in a static four chamber olfactometer with naive females of Lariophagus distinguendus Förster (Pteromalidae), a parasitoid of beetle larvae endophytic in seeds. The following seed-host complexes were tested: Sitophilus granarius in rice grains, Rhyzopertha dominica in wheat grains, and Callosobruchus maculatus in cowpeas. For comparison the non-host Sitotroga cerealella, a moth endophytic in wheat grains, was used. Healthy seeds from rice, wheat, and cowpea all had an arresting effect on L. distinguendus. Infested seeds from the complexes rice-S. granarius and wheat-R. dominica were significantly preferred over healthy seeds, but not from the complexes cowpea-C. maculatus and wheat-S. cerealella. Faeces from all beetle hosts, but not from the moth S. cerealella, had an arresting effect. These results indicate that L. distinguendus females innately react to volatile cues from different hosts and host plants. This is discussed with respect to current hypotheses on the use of chemical cues by generalist parasitoids. Die Fähigkeit eines generalistischen Parasitoiden, verschiedene Wirte mit Hilfe von Geruchsstoffen zu orten, wurde in einem statischen Vierkammer-Olfaktometer mit naiven Weibchen von Lariophagus distinguendus Förster untersucht. L. distinguendus ist ein Parasitoid von Käferlarven, die endophytisch in Samen leben. Als Samen-Wirts-Komplexe wurden Sitophilus granarius in Reis, Rhyzopertha dominica in Weizen und Callosobruchus maculatus in Kuhbohnen getestet. Zum Vergleich wurde als Nichtwirtsart die Getreidemotte Sitotroga cerealella getestet. Diese lebt ebenfalls endophytisch in Weizenkörnern. Gesunde Samen von Reis, Weizen und Bohnen hatten alle eine arretierende Wirkung auf L. distinguendus. Befallene Samen der Komplexe Reis-S. granarius und Weizen-R. dominica wurden signifikant gegenüber gesunden Samen bevorzugt. Dagegen wurden für die Komplexe Kuhbohne-C. maculatus und Weizen-S. cerealella keine Unterschiede zwischen befallenen und gesunden Samen gefunden. Der Kot aller Wirtsarten, aber nicht der Kot der Getreidemotte, hatte eine arretierende Wirkung. L. distinguendus Weibchen reagieren demnach angeboren auf Geruchsstoffe von verschiedenen Wirten und Wirtspflanzen.

	abstract = {Summary
An outstanding feature of orchids is the diversity of their pollination systems [1]. Most remarkable are those species that employ chemical deceit for the attraction of pollinators [2]. The orchid Epipactis helleborine is a typical wasp flower, exhibiting physiological and morphological adaptations for the attraction of pollinating social wasps [3]. As noted by Darwin [1], this species is almost entirely overlooked by other potential pollinators, despite a large nectar reward. Therefore, the mechanism for the attraction of pollinating social wasps was something of a mystery. By using a combination of behavioral experiments, electrophysiological investigations, and chemical analyses, we demonstrate for the first time that the flowers of E. helleborine and E. purpurata emit green-leaf volatiles (GLVs), which are attractive to foragers of the social wasps Vespula germanica and V. vulgaris. GLVs, emitted by damaged plant tissues, are known to guide parasitic wasps to their hosts [4]. Several E. helleborine GLVs that induced response in the antennae of wasps were also emitted by cabbage leaves infested with caterpillars (Pieris brassicae), which are common prey items for wasps [5]. This is the first example in which GLVs have been implicated in chemical mimicry for the attraction of pollinating insects.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
The responsiveness of humans to conspecific chemical cues as well as their rate of production of diverse potential olfactory signals suggests that it may be inappropriate to characterize members of human species as “microsmatic.” Skin glands of presumed semiochemical significance are distributed over the entire body surface, with localized dense aggregations occurring in sites, such as the axillary, scalp, areolar, and pubogenital areas. Topographical variation in the amount of glandular secretions/excretions is correlated with structural and physiological modifications that potentially enhance their communicative efficacy. Perceptible odors emanating from individuals are the result of a complex interaction between genetically influenced factors and environmental variables. Distinctive body odors provide a reliable basis for social discrimination. Animal behaviorists have devised effective testing paradigms and quantifiable behavioral measures for studying overt responsiveness to olfactory stimuli. Assay techniques originally developed to determine the chemical composition of insect pheromones have also been used for analyzing mammalian chemical signals. Neuroanatomical and neuroendocrine manipulations of laboratory animals have afforded insights into the physiological bases of odor perception and implicated chemoreceptive inputs in addition to olfaction sensu stricto in the mediation of social interactions. As any chemical cuing system involves the generation and transmission of chemosignals by a sender, and their detection, identification, and integration by a receiver, this chapter is organized in two parts. The discussion of social olfaction is preceded by a section on emission of potential chemical signals.},

Monitoring and control of clover weevils would be facilitated by semiochemical-based methods.

Here we analyzed the antenna of the white clover (Trifolium repens L.) specialist Apion fulvipes Geoffroy with scanning electron microscopy, and used single sensillum recordings with a set of 28 host compounds to characterize 18 classes of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Nine of the OSN classes responded strongly to synthetic compounds with high abundance in clover leaves, flowers, or buds. Eight classes responded only weakly to the synthetic stimuli, whereas one collective class responded exclusively to volatiles released from a crushed clover leaf. The OSNs showed a remarkable degree of specificity, responding to only one or a few chemically related compounds. In addition, we recorded a marked difference in the temporal dynamics of responses between different neurons, compounds, and doses. The identified physiologically active compounds will be screened for behavioral activity, with the ultimate goal to develop an odor-based control strategy for this pest.},

	abstract = {With the advent of next-generation sequencing, it is now possible to rapidly identify the entire repertoire of olfactory genes likely to be involved in chemical communication of an insect species. It remains, however, a challenge to identify olfactory proteins, such as odorant receptors and odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), vis-à-vis the odorants they detect. It has been reported that exposing the olfactory system to a physiologically relevant odorant alters the transcript levels of odorant receptor(s) involved in the detection of the tested odorant. We applied this paradigm in an attempt to identify putative OBPs from the scarab beetle Holotrichia oblita involved in the reception of plant-derived kairomones. Twenty-nine OBP genes were identified in the H. oblita transcriptome, 20 of which were enriched in antennae compared with nonolfactory tissues. Of these, 2 OBP genes, HoblOBP13 and HoblOBP9, were upregulated upon exposure to one of the female attractants (E)-2-hexenol and phenethyl alcohol; none of the OBP transcripts changed upon exposure to methyl anthranilate, which does not attract H. oblita females. Binding assays showed that HoblOBP13 and HoblOBP9 have high affinity for (E)-2-hexenol and phenethyl alcohol, respectively. RNAi treatment showed that transcripts of both HoblOBP13 and HoblOBP9 declined in a time-course manner 24–72 h postinjection. OBP-dsRNA-treated female beetles showed significantly lower attraction to (E)-2-hexenol and phenethyl alcohol than did water-injected beetles and those treated with GFP-dsRNA. We, therefore, concluded that HoblOBP13 and HoblOBP9 are essential for H. oblita reception of the plant-derived kairomones (E)-2-hexenol and phenethyl alcohol.},

Through a process of optimization of main factors affecting HS-SPME efficiency, the coating divivnilbenzene-carboxen-polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/Car/PDMS) was chosen as the optimum extraction phase, not only in terms of extraction efficiency, but also for its broader analyte coverage. Optimum extraction temperature was 30°C, while an extraction time of 15min provided the best compromise between extraction efficiencies of lower and higher molecular weight compounds. The optimized protocol was demonstrated to be capable of sampling plant material with high reproducibility, considering that most classes of analytes met the 20\% RSD FDA criterion. The optimized method was employed for the analysis of three classes of M. splendens samples, generating a final list of 65 tentatively identified VOC, including alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketones, phenol derivatives, as well as mono and sesquiterpenes. Significant differences were evident amongst the volatile profiles obtained from non-galled leaves (NGL) and leaf-folding galls (LFG) of M. splendens. Several differences pertaining to amounts of alcohols and aldehydes were detected between samples, particularly regarding quantities of green leaf volatiles (GLV). Alcohols represented about 14\% of compounds detected in gall samples, whereas in non-galled samples, alcohol content was below 5\%. Phenolic derived compounds were virtually absent in reference samples, while in non-galled leaves and galls their content ranged around 0.2\% and 0.4\%, respectively. Likewise, methyl salicylate, a well-known signal of plant distress, amounted for 1.2\% of the sample content of galls, whereas it was only present in trace levels in reference samples. Chemometric analysis based on Heatmap associated with Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) provided a suitable tool to differentiate VOC profiles in vegetal material, and could open new perspectives and opportunities in agricultural and ecological studies for the detection and identification of herbivore-induced plant VOC emissions.},

	abstract = {The gall midge Gephyraulus lycantha (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) is a serious gall-forming pest that causes devastating damage in the wolfberry, Lycium barbarum (Solanaceae) in Northwest China. In the present study, the external morphology and ultrastructure of the antennae and the antennal sensilla of G. lycantha were examined by scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the moniliform antenna of G. lycantha consisted of a scape, pedicel, and flagellum, and exhibited obvious sexual dimorphism. The male antennae were significantly longer than those of females. Moreover, male flagellomeres were spheroidal nodes separated by slender internodes, whereas those of females were cylindrical with no obvious internodes. There were sex and individual differences in antennal segment number. Male antennae had 10 − 16 flagellomeres, most of which had 15, while female antennae consisted of 8 − 14 flagellomeres, most of which had 12. Moreover, a pair of antennae in the same individual had different numbers of flagellomeres. Four types of sensilla were observed along the surface of the antennae, including sensilla chaetica, sensilla trichodea, sensilla coeloconica, and sensilla circumfila. Among the types of sensilla, sensilla chaetica were the longest and most prominent sensilla discovered on the antennal flagellum in both sexes. Sensilla trichodea were widely distributed over the antennal surface, including the scape, pedicel, and flagellum. Sensilla coeloconica were categorized into four subtypes: sensilla coeloconica Ⅰ, sensilla coeloconica Ⅱ, sensilla coeloconica Ⅲ, and sensilla coeloconica IV; however, sensilla coeloconica IV was absent in females. Sensilla circumfila were found only on cecidomyiidae insect antennae and were attached to the surface by a series of stalks, forming loops around each flagellomere. The numbers of all four types of sensilla on the male antennal windward side were significantly higher than those on the leeward side. The probable biological functions of these sensilla were discussed herein based on their morphology and ultrastructure. These results provide an important basis for further research on chemical communication and strategies for the control of G. lycantha, and it will be able to serve future group Taxonomy studies (species of cecidomyiidae), providing new taxonomic characters (general ultrastructural morphology, number of sensilla and antennal segments, distribution of different types of setae, types and subtypes sensilla), which varies between species and subspecies.},

	abstract = {Many plant species are used for medicinal purposes without the knowledge of their possible toxic effect. The ethnopharmacologically renowned genus Achillea L. (Asteraceae) is even more troublesome in this respect since different taxa are believed to have the same beneficial properties as A. millefolium. According to the median lethal i.p. dose (LD50=853mg/kg, mice), the volatiles of Achillea umbellata Sibth. et Sm. are more toxic than the thujone-containing essential oils (LD50{\textgreater}960mg/kg). A GC–MS analysis of A. umbellata oil revealed the presence of a series of fragranyl esters (six new natural products). The major constituents of this oil, the rare monoterpene alcohol fragranol and fragranyl acetate, and one more ester (benzoate), as well as the oil itself, showed antianxiety, analgesic and, in some instances, paralyzing properties at 50–150mg/kg but these are very likely sign of intoxication and not of possible beneficial effects of the plant volatiles. Testing of antimicrobial activity demonstrated that the oil possesses moderate activity against pathogenic microorganisms, but the effect of the oil differs in pro- and eukaryotic cells. According to the results obtained, fragranol may be considered as the main active principle responsible for the observed activity/toxicity.},

	abstract = {Insecticide resistance is one of the major obstacles for controlling agricultural pests. There have been a lot of studies on insecticides stimulating the development of insect resistance. Herbicides account for the largest sector in the agrochemical market and are often co-applied with insecticides to control insect pests and weeds in the same cropland ecosystem. However, whether and how herbicides exposure will affect insecticide resistance in insect pests is largely unexplored. Here we reported that after exposure to herbicide butachlor, the lepidopteran Spodoptera litura larvae reduced susceptibility to the insecticide chlorpyrifos. Docking simulation studies suggested that general odorant-binding protein 2 (GOBP2) could bind to butachlor with high binding affinity, and silencing SlGOBP2 by RNA interference (RNAi) decreased larval tolerance to chlorpyrifos. Butachlor exposure induced ecdysone biosynthesis, whose function on increasing chlorpyrifos tolerance was supported in synergism experiments and confirmed by silencing the key gene (SlCYP307A1) for ecdysone synthesis. Butachlor exposure also activated the expression of detoxification enzyme genes. Silencing the genes with the highest herbicide-induced expression among the three detoxification enzyme genes led to increased larval susceptibility to chlorpyrifos. Collectively, we proposed a new mechanism that olfactory recognition of herbicides by GOBP2 triggers insect hormone biosynthesis and leads to high metabolic tolerance against insecticides. These findings provide valuable information for the dissection of mechanisms of herbicide-induced resistance to insecticides and also supplements the development of reduced-risk strategies for pest control.},

	abstract = {The development and use of entomopathogens as classical, conservation and augmentative biological control agents have included a number of successes and some setbacks in the past 15years. In this forum paper we present current information on development, use and future directions of insect-specific viruses, bacteria, fungi and nematodes as components of integrated pest management strategies for control of arthropod pests of crops, forests, urban habitats, and insects of medical and veterinary importance. Insect pathogenic viruses are a fruitful source of microbial control agents (MCAs), particularly for the control of lepidopteran pests. Most research is focused on the baculoviruses, important pathogens of some globally important pests for which control has become difficult due to either pesticide resistance or pressure to reduce pesticide residues. Baculoviruses are accepted as safe, readily mass produced, highly pathogenic and easily formulated and applied control agents. New baculovirus products are appearing in many countries and gaining an increased market share. However, the absence of a practical in vitro mass production system, generally higher production costs, limited post application persistence, slow rate of kill and high host specificity currently contribute to restricted use in pest control. Overcoming these limitations are key research areas for which progress could open up use of insect viruses to much larger markets. A small number of entomopathogenic bacteria have been commercially developed for control of insect pests. These include several Bacillus thuringiensis sub-species, Lysinibacillus (Bacillus) sphaericus, Paenibacillus spp. and Serratia entomophila. B. thuringiensis sub-species kurstaki is the most widely used for control of pest insects of crops and forests, and B. thuringiensis sub-species israelensis and L. sphaericus are the primary pathogens used for control of medically important pests including dipteran vectors. These pathogens combine the advantages of chemical pesticides and MCAs: they are fast acting, easy to produce at a relatively low cost, easy to formulate, have a long shelf life and allow delivery using conventional application equipment and systemics (i.e. in transgenic plants). Unlike broad spectrum chemical pesticides, B. thuringiensis toxins are selective and negative environmental impact is very limited. Of the several commercially produced MCAs, B. thuringiensis (Bt) has more than 50\% of market share. Extensive research, particularly on the molecular mode of action of Bt toxins, has been conducted over the past two decades. The Bt genes used in insect-resistant transgenic crops belong to the Cry and vegetative insecticidal protein families of toxins. Bt has been highly efficacious in pest management of corn and cotton, drastically reducing the amount of broad spectrum chemical insecticides used while being safe for consumers and non-target organisms. Despite successes, the adoption of Bt crops has not been without controversy. Although there is a lack of scientific evidence regarding their detrimental effects, this controversy has created the widespread perception in some quarters that Bt crops are dangerous for the environment. In addition to discovery of more efficacious isolates and toxins, an increase in the use of Bt products and transgenes will rely on innovations in formulation, better delivery systems and ultimately, wider public acceptance of transgenic plants expressing insect-specific Bt toxins. Fungi are ubiquitous natural entomopathogens that often cause epizootics in host insects and possess many desirable traits that favor their development as MCAs. Presently, commercialized microbial pesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi largely occupy niche markets. A variety of molecular tools and technologies have recently allowed reclassification of numerous species based on phylogeny, as well as matching anamorphs (asexual forms) and teleomorphs (sexual forms) of several entomopathogenic taxa in the Phylum Ascomycota. Although these fungi have been traditionally regarded exclusively as pathogens of arthropods, recent studies have demonstrated that they occupy a great diversity of ecological niches. Entomopathogenic fungi are now known to be plant endophytes, plant disease antagonists, rhizosphere colonizers, and plant growth promoters. These newly understood attributes provide possibilities to use fungi in multiple roles. In addition to arthropod pest control, some fungal species could simultaneously suppress plant pathogens and plant parasitic nematodes as well as promote plant growth. A greater understanding of fungal ecology is needed to define their roles in nature and evaluate their limitations in biological control. More efficient mass production, formulation and delivery systems must be devised to supply an ever increasing market. More testing under field conditions is required to identify effects of biotic and abiotic factors on efficacy and persistence. Lastly, greater attention must be paid to their use within integrated pest management programs; in particular, strategies that incorporate fungi in combination with arthropod predators and parasitoids need to be defined to ensure compatibility and maximize efficacy. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) in the genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis are potent MCAs. Substantial progress in research and application of EPNs has been made in the past decade. The number of target pests shown to be susceptible to EPNs has continued to increase. Advancements in this regard primarily have been made in soil habitats where EPNs are shielded from environmental extremes, but progress has also been made in use of nematodes in above-ground habitats owing to the development of improved protective formulations. Progress has also resulted from advancements in nematode production technology using both in vivo and in vitro systems; novel application methods such as distribution of infected host cadavers; and nematode strain improvement via enhancement and stabilization of beneficial traits. Innovative research has also yielded insights into the fundamentals of EPN biology including major advances in genomics, nematode-bacterial symbiont interactions, ecological relationships, and foraging behavior. Additional research is needed to leverage these basic findings toward direct improvements in microbial control.},

Human-parasitic nematodes infect more than one billion people worldwide and cause some of the most common neglected tropical diseases, particularly in low-resource countries [1]. Parasitic nematodes of livestock and crops result in billions of dollars in losses each year [1]. Many nematode infections are treatable with low-cost anthelmintic drugs, but repeated infections are common in endemic areas and drug resistance is a growing concern with increasing therapeutic and agricultural administration [1]. Many parasitic nematodes have an environmental infective larval stage that engages in host seeking, a process whereby the infective larvae use sensory cues to search for hosts. Host seeking is a complex behavior that involves multiple sensory modalities, including olfaction, gustation, thermosensation, and humidity sensation. As the initial step of the parasite-host interaction, host seeking could be a powerful target for preventative intervention. However, host-seeking behavior remains poorly understood. Here we review what is currently known about the host-seeking behaviors of different parasitic nematodes, including insect-parasitic nematodes, mammalian-parasitic nematodes, and plant-parasitic nematodes. We also discuss the neural bases of these behaviors.},

This study analyzes the effects of land-use intensity at both landscape and local scales on the main insect pests, predators and yield of grain sorghum as a summer crop in Uruguay. It represents one of very few landscape studies focused on a reduced intensity production system other than organic agriculture and adds information from an under-studied subtropical region. Piecewise structural equation models were used to compare the direct and indirect effects of intensification at landscape scales and more sustainable practices at a local scale on densities of Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) and Rhopalosiphum maidis (corn leaf aphid), coccinellid abundance and yield over a two-year period in sorghum fields in western Uruguay. Greater landscape intensity resulted in increased S. frugiperda densities. Lower intensity crop-grazing rotation production systems reduced R. maidis densities compared to continuous cropping systems. Additionally, S. frugiperda and R. maidis interacted indirectly through apparent commensalism in continuous cropping systems, but not in crop-grazing rotational systems. Single cropping management resulted in lower S. frugiperda density, while insecticide use had no effect on pest or predator species. Our analysis affirms that agricultural intensification benefits herbivorous arthropod pests at the landscape scale, but that local management practices can mitigate some of these effects.},

Recently it was found that root herbivore may also elicit both local and systemic responses affecting aboveground herbivores and their natural enemies. Using broccoli (Brassica oleracea subsp. italica L.) and turnip (Brassica rapa subsp. rapa L.), two cultivated brassicaceaous plants differing in their chemistry and morphology, we analysed the local and systemic induced responses triggered by Delia radicum L. damage, JA and SA application. We also assessed whether the root induction treatments affected D. radicum larval performance. Both D. radicum damage and JA induced changes in glucosinolate and sugar content as well as affected D. radicum performance, while SA application did not. Despite the uniform chemical responses, the effect on larval performance on broccoli and turnip plants was very different. On broccoli, JA root treatment reduced herbivore performance, whereas in turnips the same treatment enhanced it. JA- and D. radicum-induced responses followed similar patterns, which suggests that the JA signalling pathway is involved in root-induced responses to larval feeding. Glucosinolate induction cannot fully explain the differences found in the performance of D. radicum on the different species. Changes in other resistance factors might significantly contribute to the induced resistance in these brassicaceaeous species as well.},

	abstract = {Silicon (Si) provides several benefits to plants, especially to those under various stresses, despite being considered nonessential for plant growth and development. From a different perspective, Si can be classified as a “multibeneficial” quasiessential element for plants. In the literature, one can find numerous references on how Si helps plants alleviate biotic and abiotic stresses. However, not much is known of how silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) can help plants develop resistance against abiotic stresses. Previous studies indicate that the molecular mechanisms with which Si and SiNPs improve the growth of plants under different biotic and abiotic stresses need further research. To improve the uptake of Si and SiNPs by plants and thereby the derived benefits, understanding the molecular basis of the uptake and transport of Si and SiNPs within plant tissues is needed. Studies in the literature indicate that NPs may also induce NP toxicity and therefore harm plants. SiNPs may cause oxidative damages, decrease photosynthesis and chlorophyll levels in plants, and hinder seed germination and seedling establishment. This chapter summarizes how Si and SiNPs improve plants’ morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits in response to different biotic and abiotic stresses. In addition, the information gaps related to Si and SiNPs in soil and analyzing the current and future aspects of them for the crop productivity are addressed. This chapter provides information that will help direct future research on how better to harness the benefits of Si and SiNPs and develop a more sustainable system for growing crops.},

In this study, we investigated the potential effects of foliar application of nanoselenium for a two-year field experiment on tea plants under pesticide-induced oxidative stress. Compared to control, nano-Se (10 mg/L) markedly enhanced the protein, soluble sugar, carotenoid, tea polyphenols, and catechins contents. High levels of theanine, glutamic acid, proline, and arginine were found to be induced most likely by adjusting the GS-GOGAT cycle. Se-supplementation may promote tea leaves’ secondary metabolism, thus increasing the accumulation of total phenols and flavonoids (apigenin, kaempferol, quercetin, myricetin, and rutin). It also minimized the accumulation of malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide anion by activating the antioxidants enzymes including in the AsA-GSH cycle. Selenium-rich tea also showed better fragrance and flavor. In summary, nano-Se can ameliorate the nutrients quality and abiotic stresses resistance of crops.},

Morphological identification of olfactory receptors was also performed. The third antennal segment (flagellum) bears four types of multiporous sensilla: trichoid, short basiconica, clavate and grooved. Maxillary palps have mechanosensory bristles and multiporous basiconica sensilla. In wind-tunnel bioassays, olive fly responses to volatiles emitted by bacterial filtrate were higher than those to culture medium. Bacterial filtrate was more attractive than ammonium carbonate or a mixture of ethyl acetate and acetic acid in ethanol. GC–MS of bacterial filtrate identified some of the chemicals produced by bacterial activity, including methyl thiolacetate, ammonia, 2-pentanone, 2-heptanone, ethyl tiglate and methyl thiocyanate. Electrophysiological investigations proved that antennal sensilla are responsive to bacterial filtrate odor, methyl thiolacetate, olive leaves and olives, as well as to α-pinene, while acetic acid elicited an inhibitory response. Electropalpgrams recorded a specific response to bacterial filtrate by mated males and females, as well as a dose-dependent response relationship to methyl thiolacetate by mated females. The identification of new active volatile compounds in the semiochemical system of the olive fly is promising for the development of innovative control strategies in area-wide management.},

	abstract = {Soil microorganisms are fundamental to agriculture by improving plant nutrition and health and improving the quality of the soil to produce crops sustainably and safely. Intimate, symbiotic associations involve mycorrhizal and rhizobic bacteria, and nonsymbiotic microorganisms are also clearly shown for the communication or signaling of plants and rhizosphere microbes. Different organisms, including plants, receive signals. Mycorrhizal and rhizobial interkingdom signaling has demonstrated its central role in the creation of associations, and the contemporary discovery of nonsymbiotic communications leads in rhizomicrobiome formation. By secreting and detecting diversified signaling agents, the plant and rhizomicrobiome have strong mutual influence. A clearer understanding of the different tolerance strategies to preserve crop productivity through environmental management can help to preserve, as much as possible, the genetic potential of crops. This chapter covers various inter/intra-communications, like quorum sensing by releasing different signal molecules with particulate phytohormones, bacteriocins, vocals, etc. In addition, significant advances have been made with new technologies, including genomics and genetic transformation, in understanding these complex features in higher plants especially in the field of protection gene expression discussed in this chapter.},

The results showed that alcohols (55.519\%) and aldehydes (81.387\%) were the primary chemicals emitted by R. cymosa and R. multiflora, respectively. An electroantennogram response (EAG) test was used to compare and analyze the responses of male and female beetles to each of the selected fifteen components, and the results showed that only nine of these components triggered significant EAG responses. Sex and volatile concentration-specific responses were observed in B. horsfieldi. Male adults showed the strongest EAG response to 1-octen-3-ol, while female adults expressed the most powerful EAG responses to salicylaldehyde and linalool. These results indicated that the sensitivity of B. horsfieldi to host volatile components was different, and the EAG response was positively correlated with the concentration of the volatile components in a certain range. Male and female adults showed different preferences for the volatile components. Furthermore, B. horsfieldi showed different preferences for volatile components and exhibited diverse recognition reactions to specific functional groups and homologous isomers. This work provided favorable data support for the development of insect attractant, and laid a theoretical foundation for the local forestry ecological protection.},

	abstract = {Plants frequently attract natural enemies of their herbivores, resulting in a reduction in tissue damage and often in enhanced plant fitness. While such indirect defenses can dramatically change as plants develop, only recently have ecologists begun to explore such changes and evaluate their role in mediating plant–herbivore–natural enemy interactions. Here we review the literature documenting ontogenetic patterns in plant rewards (i.e. extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), food bodies (FBs) and domatia) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and identify links between ontogenetic patterns in such traits and the attraction of natural enemies (ants). In the case of reward traits we concentrate in ant–plant studies, which are the most numerous. We report that all indirect defensive traits commonly vary with plant age but ontogenetic trajectories differ among them. Myrmecophytic species, which provide both food and shelter to their defenders, do not produce rewarding traits until a minimum size is reached. Then, a pronounced increase in the abundance of food rewards and domatia often occurs as plants develop, which explains the temporal succession or colony size increase of mutualistic ant species and, in some cases, leads to a reduction in herbivore damage and enhanced fitness as plants age. In contrast, ontogenetic patterns were less consistent in plant species that rely on VOC emissions to attract natural enemies or those that provide only food rewards (EFNs) but not nesting sites to their associated ants, showing an overall decline or lack of trend with plant development, respectively. Future research should focus on uncovering: (i) the costs and mechanisms underlying ontogenetic variation in indirect defenses, (ii) the relative importance of environmental and genetic components shaping these ontogenetic trajectories, and (iii) the consequences of these ontogenetic trajectories on plant fitness. Advances in this area will shed light on the context dependency of bottom-up and top-down controls of herbivore populations and on how natural selection actually shapes the ontogenetic trajectories of these traits.},

Thus, there is a clear need to formulate general principles for synergistically combining traditional and novel IPM actions to improve efforts to optimize plant protection solutions.

	abstract = {Plant structures and chemicals, which are developed from the shoot apical meristem (SAM), form the main barriers to insect feeding. A plant chimera containing cells of different genetic origins in the SAM will be morphologically and chemically different compared with the parents and thus may result in differential resistance to herbivores. In this study, we explore if particular elements of plant resistance are localized in one of the layers of SAM; the replacement of one cell layer in a chimera may be linked to change of a single resistance trait to herbivores. The morphology and glucosinolate profiles of two periclinal chimeras (labeled as TTC and TCC, respectively) and grafted parents tuber mustard (labeled as TTT) and red cabbage (labeled as CCC) were compared and the performance of whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) in host selection, oviposition preference and development were assessed under controlled conditions. Both chimeras possessed leaf trichomes as parent tuber mustard TTT, however, TTC had significantly more trichomes than TCC and parent TTT. Leaf wax content of both chimeras was intermediate between the two parents. Five aliphatic and two indole glucosinolates were detected in both chimeras, whereas three aliphatic glucosinolates (3-methyl-sulfinylpropyl, 4-methyl-sulfinylbutyl and 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl) were not detected in tuber mustard, and one aliphatic glucosinolate (3-butenyl) was not detected in red cabbage. Unexpectedly for a chimera, the quantities of two aliphatic glucosinolates (3-methyl-sulfinylpropyl and 4-methyl-sulfinylbutyl) in both TTC and TCC were 3- to 5-fold higher than parents. In olfactory preference assays, B. tabaci showed preference to CCC, followed by TCC, TTC and TTT, and number of eggs laid showed the same pattern: CCC{\textgreater}TCC{\textgreater}TTC{\textgreater}TTT. Interestingly, more whiteflies landed on TTT plants than the other three types in a free choice experiment and the developmental duration from egg to adult was the shortest on TTT and increased in the order TTT{\textless}TTC{\textless}TCC{\textless}CCC. Our results indicate plant defenses traits of leaf waxes, trichomes and glucosinolates are not controlled by one cell layer of SAM, but are influenced by interactions amongst cell layers. The overall findings suggest that periclinal chimera systems can be a valuable approach for the study of plant-insect interactions and may also be useful for future resistance breeding.},

Much progress has been made in elucidating the molecular mechanisms that mediate chemoreception in insects in the past few decades. In this review, we focus on pheromone reception and detection in moths, from the molecular to the behavioral level. We trace the information pathway from the capture of pheromone by male antennae, binding and transportation to olfactory receptor neurons, receptor activation, signal transduction, molecule inactivation, through brain processing and behavioral response.

To identify putative semiochemicals bound to CcOBP2, a protein specifically expressed in antennae, 14 compounds from the pupae of H. cunea and 11 common volatile compounds from plants were selected for competitive fluorescence binding assay. The result of the binding assay showed that five compounds were able to bind toCcOBP2. The electroantennogram (EAG) demonstrated that the antennae had a significant response to the 3-Carene, a bicyclic monoterpene, and C. cunea could be obviously attracted by this compound. The behavioral response to 3- carene was dramatically weakened when CcOBP2 was specifically knocked down. The molecular docking result indicated that several amino acids especially Ile-81, Val-122, Phe-123 of CcOBP2 were responsible for binding to 3-Carene. Furthermore, there was a repellent effect on the host H. cunea with the treatment of the 3-Carene. This study illustrated that CcOBP2 might be a crucial protein involved in the olfactory signaling pathway and the 3-Carene, secreted from plants, could probably have a potential role in repelling pests as well as attracting natural enemies.},

This chapter discusses the secondary metabolites in plant-insect interactions. It has long been accepted that plant-insect interactions involve the evolution of defensive secondary metabolic pathways in plants to which insects can adapt. New theories are being proposed to account for the wide diversity of such interactions, particularly where production of plant secondary metabolites is inducible. This chapter briefly describes the more widely known mechanisms by which secondary metabolites act, such as direct toxicity, antifeedancy and sequestration. Key areas covered in greater depth involve the volatile secondary metabolites produced by plants, both inherently and in response to the stress of insect feeding and colonization. Interactions described include the location of host plants by insects and the corresponding avoidance of unsuitable host plants. The roles of volatile plant compounds in the attraction of predators and parasitoids to plants already hosting insect populations, and in the synergism of insect pheromone activity, are discussed.},

To better understand the olfactory mechanisms in the cicada Subpsaltria yangi that has a very narrow host range far fewer than diets of most other cicadas, an antennal transcriptome was constructed in this study. We identified 10 unigenes encoding putative odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), 10 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), 8 sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs), 7 gustatory receptors (GRs), 29 odorant receptors (ORs) and 13 ionotropic receptors (IRs). We found that the OBPs were separated into two groups, Classic OBPs and Plus-C OBPs, according to their motifs. Based on sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, we found five Orcos in OR family. However, no pheromone receptor was identified, which may be related to that cicadas are sound-producing insects and acoustic signals other than pheromones play most important role in sexual communication. We used qRT-PCR to examine the expression profile of ten OBPs genes in various organs, and found that they were mainly expressed in olfactory organs such as antennae and mouthparts. Our results make it possible for future research of the olfactory system of S. yangi at the molecular level, and provide important bases for elucidation of the molecular mechanisms and evolution of chemosensation in sap-sucking insects.},

	abstract = {Synthetic elicitors can be used to induce resistance in plants against pathogens and arthropod herbivores. Such compounds may also change the emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles, which serve as important cues for parasitic wasps to locate their hosts. Therefore, the use of elicitors in the field may affect biological control of insect pests. To test this, we treated maize seedlings growing in a subtropical field in Mexico with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), an elicitor of defense responses against many insects, and benzo-(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH), an elicitor of resistance against certain pathogens. Volatile emission, herbivore infestation, pathogen infection, and plant performance (growth and grain yield) of treated and untreated maize plants were measured. Application of BTH slightly reduced volatile emission in maize, while MeJA increased the emission compared to control treatments. Despite the apparent changes in volatile emissions, the elicitor application did not consistently affect infestation by Spodoptera frugiperda larvae, the main insect pest found on the maize seedlings, and had only marginal effects on parasitism rates. Similarly, there were no treatment effects on infestation by other herbivores and pathogens. Results for the six replications that stretched over one summer and one winter season were highly variable, with parasitism rates and the species composition of the parasitoids differing significantly between seasons. This variability, as well as the severe biotic and abiotic stresses on young seedlings might explain why we measured only slight effects of elicitor application on pest incidence and biological control in this specific field study. Indeed, an additional field experiment under milder and more standardized conditions revealed that BTH induced significant resistance against Bipolaris maydis, a major pathogen in the experimental maize fields. Similar affects can be expected for herbivory and parasitism rates.},

	abstract = {The antennae of the rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera : Dynastidae), comprise 4 parts : the scape, the pedicel, a funicle, and a club of 3 lamellate segments. The inner surfaces of the lamellate club segments carry one type of trichoid sensilla, 2 types of sensilla coeloconica, and 3 types of multiporous pore plate sensilla. The total surface occupied by the sensilla on the antenna is 5.2±0.4 mm2 in males (mean±SD) and 5.4±0.5 mm2 in females. With a measured density of 8665±1254 sensilla per mm2 in males and 8952±1642 sensilla per mm2 in females, the total number of pore plate sensilla was estimated to be between 45,000 and 50,000. The structure of the 3 types of pore plate sensilla is described. SP1 are the most abundant type of placoid sensilla. They show a convex and rugged plate whose infoldings form a circle of irregular cavities. SP2 sensilla are characterised by a smooth and convex plate, surrounded by a furrow with a ridge. SP2 are localised on a wide band situated along the straight side of the lamella. The plate of SP3 is nearly flat and there is no furrow. SP3 are confined within a narrow margin along the convex edge of lamellae. The 3 types of pore plate sensilla house 2 neurones whose dendrites branch repeatedly under a plate of thin (0.2 μm) cuticle, which is pitted with numerous pores, 40 nm in diameter. Single sensillum recordings with tungsten microelectrodes revealed the firing activity of 2 neurones. These receptor neurones responded specifically to olfactory stimulus. Olfactory receptor neurones tuned to the male pheromone compound, ethyl 4-methyl octanoate, were found in male and female antennae. Other receptor neurones responded to plant volatiles. Morphological and electrophysiological data suggest the absence of a sexual dimorphism in the olfactory organs. The functional organisation of the olfactory organs is discussed in terms of their adaptation to the ecology of O. rhinoceros.},

	abstract = {Carmine spider mites (Tetranychus cinnabarinus) and cotton aphids (Aphis gossypii) are both serious pests of cotton, and cause reductions in yields of this key agricultural crop. In order to gain insights into how plant defense responses induced by one herbivore species affect the behavior and performance of another, we examined how infestation with T. cinnabarinus influences the development of A. gossypii using cotton as a model. In this study, we measured the activities of several important biochemical markers and secondary metabolites in the leaves of cotton seedlings responding to infestation by T. cinnabarinus. Furthermore, the influences of T. cinnabarinus infestation on the development of A. gossypii in cotton were also examined. Our data showed that the activities of several key defense enzymes, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), peroxidase (POD), lipoxygenase (LOX), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), were substantially increased in cotton seedlings responding to spider mite infestation. Further, the contents of gossypol and condensed tannins, key defensive compounds, were significantly enhanced in leaves of cotton seedlings following T. cinnabarinus infestation. Moreover, the T. cinnabarinus-induced production of defense enzymes and secondary metabolites was correlated with infestation density. The developmental periods of A. gossypii on cotton seedling leaves infested with T. cinnabarinus at densities of 10 and 15 individuals cm−2 were 1.16 and 1.18 times that of control, respectively. Meanwhile, the mean relative growth rates of A. gossypii on cotton leaves infested with T. cinnabarinus at densities of 8, 10 and 15 individuals cm−2 were significantly reduced. Therefore, these data suggested that the developmental periods of A. gossypii were significantly lengthened and the mean relative growth rates were markedly reduced when cotton aphids were reared on plants infested with high densities of spider mites. This research sheds light on the role that inducible defense responses played in plant-mediated interspecific interactions between T. cinnabarinus and A. gossypii.},

	abstract = {Herbivory on the above-ground plant parts can induce the production of volatiles that attract carnivorous enemies of the herbivores. These volatiles may be induced systemically in the damaged plant. In a previous study, we had shown that a systemic elicitor that induces the production of predator-attracting volatiles in lima bean plants can be collected from lima bean leaves by placing spider-mite-infested leaves with their petiole in water. However, it remained unknown to what sites this elicitor was transported within the plant. Here, we show that exposing uninfested lima bean leaves to this elicitor also results in a reduced rate of reproduction in spider mites (Tetranychus urticae). Furthermore, an elicitor can also be collected from whole lima bean plants of which one primary leaf was infested with spider mites, by detaching the other primary leaf and inserting the petiole, that is still connected to the plant, in a vial with distilled water. When uninfested lima bean leaves are incubated in this elicitor solution for three days, this results in the attraction of the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis in an olfactometer. Finally, an elicitor of predator-attracting volatiles was collected from whole infested lima bean plants by placing the plants with their roots in distilled water. Uninfested lima bean plants that were subsequently placed with their roots in this water became attractive to the predatory mite P. persimilis relative to control plants that had been placed with their roots in water in which uninfested bean plants had been incubated previously. These data indicate that herbivore-infested plants may interact with undamaged neighbouring plants through chemical information that is exchanged in the soil. Important issues that need to be addressed next are discussed. The connection of above- and below-ground interactions of plants with other organisms will have important consequences for future ecological studies on multitrophic interactions.},

This paper reviews the interactions between biological control and other forms of pest management, especially induced plant defences and the novel, non-toxic plant protection compounds that may boost these defences; and sterile insect technique. We also cover the cultural methods that offer scope to support synergies between the aforementioned methodological combinations. We conclude that despite the sometimes negative consequences of other pest management techniques for biological control efficacy, there is great scope for new strategies to be developed that exploit synergies between biological control and various other techniques. Ultimately, however, we propose that future use of biological control will involve integration at a greater conceptual scale such that this important form of pest management is promoted as one of a suite of ecosystem services that can be engineered into farming systems and wider landscapes.},

The proposed biosensor measuring overall degree of plant damage is a useful tool for solving the problem. If plants are damaged, for instance by cuts made artificially or by biting or chewing insects, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) will be released to a higher extent and in a different composition compared with undamaged plants. The biosensor based on an electroantennographic technique uses the sensitivity and selectivity of an insect's antenna to detect the changes in composition of the VOC. This method is comparatively simple, inexpensive and sensitive (e.g. 1 ppbv cis-3-hexen-1-ol, dynamic range: 1 ppbv-100 ppmv) with respect to usual mass-spectrometric methods of VOC trace analysis. Moreover, the response time (10 ms) and the measurement cycle time (3 min) are short and the biosensor yields an overall parameter easier to deal with than complex mass-spectrometric data arrays. The lifetime of one antennal preparation, however, is 4 h and has to be improved.

In the chapter, a broad definition of biological control is used to discuss biological control systems on the surfaces of fruits and vegetables. This definition involves not only "one-on-one" relationships between antagonists and pathogens but also host-mediated resistance responses of the host and naturally occurring and induced antimicrobial chemicals. It explores the instances where natural suppressive microbial populations may occur on the surface of fruits and vegetables, which affect disease development. Biological control of plant diseases does not occur in a vacuum. It is a dynamic process involving the microecology of the pathogen and antagonists as well as resistance responses of the host. There is growing evidence that some epiphytic populations on the surfaces of fruits and vegetables are not there incidentally but may be under the genetic control of the host as part of its defense. Nutrient competition is an important means by which epiphytic antagonists suppress plant pathogens. Plants also have the capability to "control" microbial populations through the excretion of constitutive and induced antimicrobial compounds. Such compounds differentially favor "suppressive populations" of antagonists over other saprophytes or pathogens. The ability of plants to signal and attract specific predaceous "bodyguards" against insect attack demonstrates how plants can influence external biological control agents in response to specific pests.},

	abstract = {The beneficial microbiome associated to plants have remarkable prospective to expand the plant resilience and crop yields in an agriculture system. Considerable evidences on the role of plant beneficial microbes on altering the morphology of plant, manage pests and enhancing growth and immunity of plants and positive impact on mineral acquisitions are available. In recent times, advancements in DNA sequencing and editing techniques, played vital role in understanding the influence of the microbiomes both at endosphere and rhizosphere level in model plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana as well as in agriculturally important crops. Different plant beneficial microorganisms, solubilize mineral and nutrients in the soil, mitigate resistance to environmental stresses, suppress pathogens, improve plant growth and yield, therefore can be a potential alternate to increase agricultural productivity. Understanding the microbiome beneficial behavior with associated plants can offer a viable solution to enhance the agricultural production, which can minimize fertilizers use and biofungicides in agricultural fields. Although the bioformulations of plant beneficial microorganisms and their products are extensively explored to facilitate their use for a sustainable and enhanced crop productivity. However, prior to extensive usage of these plant assisting microorganisms, their efficiency and reliability to perform under a wide range of environmental conditions, need to be evaluated. It need intensive efforts among researchers, industrial partners and agriculturalists, to understand and implement the plant beneficial microbes in modern agricultural systems need careful address of several issues. This book chapter, provides an overview of plant beneficial microorganisms including plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, biocontrol agents and mycorrhiza.},

Host seeking is a characteristic of endoparasites such as parasitic worms as well as of ectoparasites such as mosquitoes and ticks. For host location, many of these parasites use CO2, a respiration byproduct, in combination with host-specific chemicals. Recent work has begun to elucidate the behavioral responses of parasites to CO2 and other host chemicals, and to unravel the mechanisms of these responses. Here we discuss recent findings that have greatly advanced our understanding of the chemosensory behaviors of host-seeking parasites. We focus primarily on well-studied parasites such as nematodes and insects, but also note broadly relevant findings in a few less well studied parasites.},

On tomato they synthesize, store, and emit a variety of metabolites such as terpenoids, which play a role in the interaction with insects. Glandular trichomes are excellent tissues for studying the biosynthesis of specialized plant metabolites and are especially suitable targets for metabolic engineering. Here we describe the strategy for engineering tomato glandular trichomes, first with a transient expression system to provide proof of trichome specificity of selected promoters. Using microparticle bombardment, the trichome specificity of a terpene-synthase promoter could be validated in a relatively fast way. Second, we describe a method for stable expression of genes of interest in trichomes. Trichome-specific expression of another terpene-synthase promoter driving the yellow-fluorescence protein-gene is presented. Finally, we describe a case of the overexpression of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS), specifically in tomato glandular trichomes, providing an important precursor in the biosynthetic pathway of sesquiterpenoids. FPS was targeted to the plastid aiming to engineer sesquiterpenoid production, but interestingly leading to a loss of monoterpenoid production in the transgenic tomato trichomes. With this example we show that trichomes are amenable to engineering though, even with knowledge of a biochemical pathway, the result of such engineering can be unexpected.},

However, few insect GPCRs have been functionally characterized. Here, we cloned the full length of a methuselah-like GPCR gene (Ldmthl1) from the Asian gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar. We then characterized the secondary and tertiary structures of Ldmthl1. We also predicted the global structure of this insect GPCR protein which is composed of three major domains. RNA interference of Ldmthl1 resulted in a reduction of gypsy moths' resistance to deltamethrin and suppressed expression of downstream stress-associated genes, such as P450s, glutathione S transferases, and heat shock proteins. The function of Ldmthl1 was further investigated using transgenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila with overexpression of Ldmthl1 showed significantly longer lifespan than control flies. Taken together, our studies revealed that the physiological functions of Ldmthl1 in L. dispar are associated with longevity and resistance to insecticide stresses. Potentially, Ldmthl1 can be used as a target for new insecticide discovery in order to manage this notorious forest pest.},

	abstract = {Plants emit various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) upon herbivore attack. These VOC emissions often show temporal dynamics which may influence the behavior of natural enemies using these volatiles as cues. This study analyzes on-line VOC emissions by roots of Brassica nigra plants under attack by cabbage root fly larvae, Delia radicum. Root emitted VOCs were detected using Proton-Transfer-Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) and Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS). These analyses showed that several sulfur containing compounds, such as methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) and glucosinolate breakdown products, such as thiocyanates (TC) and isothiocyanates (ITC), were emitted by the roots in response to infestation. The emissions were subdivided into early responses, emerging within 1–6h after infestation, and late responses, evolving only after 6–12h. The marker for rapid responses was detected at m/z 60. The ion detected at m/z 60 was identified as thiocyanic acid, which is also a prominent fragment in some TC or ITC spectra. The emission of m/z 60 stopped when the larvae had pupated, which makes it an excellent indicator for actively feeding larvae. Methanethiol, DMS and DMDS levels increased much later in infested roots, indicating that activation of enzymes or genes involved in the production of these compounds may be required. Earlier studies have shown that both early and late responses can play a role in tritrophic interactions associated with Brassica species. Moreover, the identification of these root induced responses will help to design non-invasive analytical procedures to assess root infestations.},

The aim of the present investigation focused on isolation, identification, and volatile production of fungi from pine-weevil feces and frass. Fungi were isolated from weevil frass and feces separately, followed by identification based on ITS sequencing. Fifty-nine isolates belonging to the genera Penicillium, Ophiostoma, Mucor, Leptographium, Eucasphaeria, Rhizosphaera, Debaryomyces, and Candida were identified. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by the fungal community and fungal isolates cultured on weevil-frass broth were identified by SPME-GCMS.

Volatile organic compounds (VOC) in wheat and rotation crops, such as chickpea, may negatively impact pathogenic Fusarium.

Also found was 1-penten-3-ol in chickpea roots and in the root nodules of two of the three cultivars tested. Chickpea VOC production pattern was related (P=0.023) to Ascochyta blight severity, suggesting that 1-penten-3-ol and cis-3-hexen-1-ol were induced by Ascochyta rabiei. Bioassays conducted in Petri plates established that chickpea-produced VOC used in isolation were generally more potent against Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium avenaceum than wheat-produced VOC, except for 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, which was rare in wheat and toxic to both Fusarium and tetraploid wheat. Whereas exposure to 1-penten-3-ol and 2-methyl-1-propanol could suppress radial growth by over 50\% and octanoic acid-ethyl ester, nonanol, and nonanoic acid-ethyl ester had only weak effects, F. graminearum and F. avenaceum growth was completely inhibited by exposure to trans-2-hexenal, trans-2-hexen-1-ol, cis-3-hexen-1-ol, and 1-hexanol. Among these VOC, trans-2-hexenal and 1-hexanol protected wheat seedlings against F. avenaceum and F. graminearum, respectively, in a controlled condition experiment. Genetic variation in the production of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, a potent VOC produced in low amount by wheat, suggests the possibility of selecting Fusarium resistance in wheat on the basis of leaf VOC concentration. Results also suggests that the level of Fusarium inoculum in chickpea–wheat rotation systems may be reduced by growing chickpea genotypes with high root and shoot levels of trans-2-hexen-1-ol and 1-hexanol.},

In order to explore the effects of omethoate on the cotton defense in relation to (+)-δ-cadinene synthase and gossypol, effects of omethoate treatments on activity of (+)-δ-cadinene synthase and gossypol content in cotton seedlings were investigated. Cotton seedlings treated with 400 mg L−1 omethoate exhibited a significant decrease in the specific activity of (+)-δ-cadinene synthase from 12 to 120 h after treating when compared to the untreated control; significantly lower (+)-δ-cadinene synthase activity was also observed in cotton seedlings treated with 200 mg L−1 omethoate from 72 to 120 h after treating; but for cotton seedlings treated with 100 mg L−1 omethoate, from 12 to 120 h after treating, no significant changes were observed for activity of (+)-δ-cadinene synthase. The gossypol content in cotton seedlings treated with 100, 200 or 400 mg L−1 omethoate for different time periods showed no significant changes compared to that of the control.

	abstract = {The triterpene squalene is a key metabolic intermediate for sterols, hopanoids and various other triterpenoids. The biosynthesis of squalene is catalyzed by squalene synthase (SQS), which converts two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate to squalene. In this study, a lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii was found to emit squalene as a volatile compound under a number of conditions that mimic biotic stresses. Searching the genome sequence of S. moellendorffii led to the identification of a putative squalene synthase gene. It was designated as SmSQS. SmSQS is homologous to known squalene synthases from other plants and animals at both the amino acid level and structural level. Recombinant SmSQS expressed in Escherichia coli catalyzed the formation of squalene using farnesyl diphosphate as substrate. The expression of SmSQS was significantly induced by the same set of stress factors that induced the emission of volatile squalene from S. moellendorffii plants. Taken together, these results support that SmSQS is responsible for the biosynthesis of volatile squalene and volatile squalene may have a role in the defense of S. moellendorffii plants against biotic stresses.},

Alternative tactics for crop protection reduce pest numbers to a level that does not cause economic damage in the crop. They include cultural and agronomic tactics, mechanical, physical and biological tactics, behavioral control using semiochemicals, and the principle of the sterile insect release method. In conventional high-input agriculture, the most convincing reason, from the grower's point of view, for replacing or complementing pesticides with alternatives is to avoid or delay pesticide resistance and to prevent the resurgence of primary pests and/or upsurges of secondary pests. Other important reasons are food, worker, and environmental safety. Alternative tactics are not universal; rather, they are location and time-specific. The cornerstone alternatives, cultural tactics being the most essential, work by the principle of preventing pest colonization or multiplication. Some alternative approaches lend themselves to remedial use, but the emphasis is always on prevention rather than intervention. This chapter presents the basic features of alternative plant protection tactics, their integration, and their food, worker, and environmental safety. Two production systems for fresh food—apples and greenhouse vegetables—are used to exemplify the possibilities, efficiency and current status of application, and integration of alternative methods. The scope of the case studies is mainly European. The chapter highlights the basic future trends and factors that drive or hinder the adoption of emerging alternative tools.},

The expression profiles of the ten OBPs were determined based on a qPCR analysis of RNA extracted from the antennae, legs, and abdomens of wingless and winged female adults and whole larvae and pupae. The highest levels of OBP5, OBP6, OBP7, and OBP9 expression were observed in the antennae of adult females. The highest levels of OBP1, OBP2, and OBP4 expression were observed in the abdomen of winged females. The highest levels of OBP3 and OBP10 expression were observed in larvae and pupae, respectively, whereas OBP8 was expressed at high levels in both larvae and pupae. Our findings establish a foundation for future studies of the molecular mechanisms of chemosensory perception in Sclerodermus sp.},

	abstract = {Predaceous lady beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) are a well-studied group of consumers that can yield insight into relationships among interspecific niche differences, species richness, and prey consumption. In various studies, sympatric lady beetles differ in habitat-use at the scales of landscapes, single agricultural fields, and single plants. Species also differ in their seasonal and diel activity-patterns. These spatiotemporal differences in habitat-use should lead to complementary impacts on prey, by encouraging different predator species to attack different subsets of the prey population. This in turn should lead to stronger biological control at higher predator diversity levels. Indeed, experimental manipulations of predator species richness in communities that include coccinellids have generally revealed stronger prey suppression with greater predator biodiversity. In these experimental studies, lady beetles sometimes filled unique niches as particularly voracious predators, and often also complemented or facilitated prey capture by other species. Intraguild predation was rarely found to be a strongly disruptive force, perhaps because spatiotemporal niche differences reduced encounters among species. In summary, coccinellid species both respond to and affect their communities in unique ways, generally to the benefit of herbivore suppression. Thus, the best niche fit for coccinellids may be that of a complement to other species, contributing to improved biological control with greater predator biodiversity.},

In microorganisms, the majority of these secondary metabolites are produced by exceptionally large, multifunctional proteins termed polyketide synthases (PKSs). Each unit of a type I PKS assembly line resembles a mammalian type fatty acid synthase (FAS), although certain domains are optionally missing. The evolutionary analysis of microbial PKS has revealed a long joint evolution process of PKSs and FASs. The phylogenomic analysis of modular type I PKSs as the most widespread PKS type in bacteria showed a large impact of gene duplications and gene losses on the evolution of type I PKS in different bacterial groups. The majority of type I PKSs in actinobacteria and cyanobacteria may have evolved from a common ancestor, whereas in proteobacteria most type I PKSs were acquired from other bacterial groups. The modularization of type I PKSs almost unexceptionally started with multiple duplications of a single ancestor module. The repeating modules represent ideal platforms for recombination events that can lead to corresponding changes in the actual chemistry of the products. The analysis of these “natural reprogramming” events of PKSs may assist in the development of concepts for the biocombinatorial design of bioactive compounds.},

This chapter reviews the methods that have been developed for the collection and isolation of insect pheromones and related compounds. The chapter provides examples from other taxa. The apparatus and techniques for collection of trace quantities of pheromones, with adjustments for scale, are dictated more by the chemical and physical properties of the pheromones, and the physical circumstances required for their production or extraction, than by the particular organism. For example, the same general sampling techniques have been used to sample pheromones from organisms as small as single-celled gametes to as large as Asian elephants. With the identification of the first insect pheromone several decades ago, a series of specialized techniques have been developed to streamline the identification process. Such dynamic collection methods provide a more accurate representation of the pheromone blends produced by organisms than tissue extractions and allow repeated sampling from the same individuals. For small-scale collections, analytes may be trapped on short beds of Porapak Q, Tenax, or activated charcoal. For large-scale collection of analytes for bioassay or for spectroscopic analysis, large numbers of organisms can be placed in appropriate sized aeration chambers supplied with food and water, with collections continued indefinitely, changing the collectors periodically.},

Current profit margins are low or non-existent with these conventional non-sustainable practices and must be changed if the family farm is to survive. We propose an ecologically based approach to farm management that strives to reduce reliance on chemically intensive inputs through better use of multiple attributes inherent within agroecosystems. This approach requires a redirection in the development and application of current and emerging technologies. Examples of redirections in research and development programs for pest management practices, genetic engineering, and precision agriculture necessary to provide a more ecologically-based and sustainable farming approach are illustrated.},

	abstract = {Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) is known to respond to eggs laid by the sawfly Diprion pini on its needles by releasing a blend of terpenoids, including the sesquiterpene (E)-β-farnesene. These compounds attract a wasp, Closterocerus ruforum, which parasitizes sawfly eggs. D. pini oviposition also enhances the transcription of two sesquiterpene synthases, an (E)-β-caryophyllene/α-humulene synthase (PsTPS1) and a 1(10),5-germacradiene-4-ol synthase (PsTPS2). To gain a better understanding of the function of these sesquiterpenes in promoting insect egg parasitism, we compared the outcome of D. pini oviposition on P. sylvestris with interactions between other pine and sawfly species: Neodiprion sertifer eggs on P. sylvestris, Gilpinia pallida eggs on P. sylvestris, D. pini eggs on Pinus nigra. The first of these attracts the parasitoid C. ruforum, while the latter two do not. As determined by quantitative real-time PCR, both PsTPS1 and PsTPS2 transcripts increased significantly only for those species combinations where the odor of egg–laden pine needles was attractive to C. ruforum. Moreover, enhanced transcription of these genes was found only at those time periods when odor was attractive, i.e. 3days after oviposition. Thus, the PsTPS1 and PsTPS2 genes are good markers for parasitoid attraction. We also characterized a sesquiterpene synthase from P. sylvestris (PsTPS5) which produces (E)-β-farnesene, the compound previously determined to be responsible for C. ruforum attraction. However, transcript levels of PsTPS5 were not enhanced by oviposition of sawfly species that cause C. ruforum attraction. More research on this experimental system is required to determine the role of oviposition-induced sesquiterpenes in attracting egg parasitoids and the role of sesquiterpene synthases in regulating sesquiterpene formation.},

This finding indicates that intact lima bean plants may be responsive to volatile signals. Further, as green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are released from green plants in response to mechanical damage caused by herbivores, we studied possible involvement of GLVs in plant–plant interaction. We found that (Z)-3-hexenol, (E)-2-hexenal, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, induced the expression of defense genes in uninfested leaves.

	abstract = {Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) consisting of six-carbon aldehydes, alcohols, and their esters, are biosynthesized through the action of fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), which uses fatty acid hydroperoxides as substrates. GLVs form immediately after disruption of plant leaf tissues by herbivore attacks and mechanical wounding and play a role in defense against attackers that attempt to invade through the wounds. The fates and the physiological significance of the counterparts of the HPL reaction, the 12/10-carbon oxoacids that are formed from 18/16-carbon fatty acid 13-/11-hydroperoxides, respectively, are largely unknown. In this study, we detected monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) containing the 12/10-carbon HPL products in disrupted leaf tissues of Arabidopsis, cabbage, tobacco, tomato, and common bean. They were identified as an MGDG containing 12-oxo-9-hydroxy-(E)-10-dodecenoic acid and 10-oxo-7-hydroxy-(E)-8-decenoic acid and an MGDG containing two 12-oxo-9-hydroxy-(E)-10-dodecenoic acids as their acyl groups. Analyses of Arabidopsis mutants lacking HPL indicated that these MGDGs were formed enzymatically through an active HPL reaction. Thus, our results suggested that in disrupted leaf tissues, MGDG-hydroperoxides were cleaved by HPL to form volatile six-carbon aldehydes and non-volatile 12/10-carbon aldehyde-containing galactolipids. Based on these results, we propose a novel oxylipin pathway that does not require the lipase reaction to form GLVs. Background: The pathway to form green leaf volatiles is important for plant defense against pathogens and herbivores. Results: Galactolipids with truncated oxoacids are formed as counterparts of green leaf volatiles. Conclusion: Galactolipid-hydroperoxides are substrates for hydroperoxide lyase. Significance: The biosynthetic pathway partly proceeds directly with galactolipids, without the involvement of lipases, to form free fatty acids.},

	abstract = {Coccinellidae (Coleoptera) comprises magnificent insects that are commonly known as ladybirds or lady beetles. Mostly, they are predaceous on numerous phytophagous insects and acarine pests and could be manipulated in biocontrol programs. Coccinellids are both specialists (feeding on monospecific diet) and generalists. Usually, specialists are better biocontrol agents as they will not disperse and focus on the nontarget prey. However, a few generalists also have an immense biocontrol potential. This chapter presents an overview of coccinellids in terms of attributes that enable them to a better biocontrol agents and their utility in the insect and acarine pest management programs. Biocontrol is largely dependent on feeding propensity, which is discussed in the light of prey specialization, prey suitability, and food economics. Analysis of food handling has been done in terms of functional response, numerical response, and efficiency of conversion of ingested materials. These analytical tools are the indicators of the success of biocontrol program using predaceous ladybirds. Ladybirds are highly promiscuous and efficient mating models in studies pertaining to ecological and evolutionary significance. Body size and age have important roles in the quantitative progeny production in ladybirds. The status of ladybirds in the guild tags their success or failure. Successful struggle within and outside the family is a key for the successful establishment of certain invasive ladybirds in new biogeographical habitats. Prey–predator interactions are largely driven by semiochemicals released by both prey and predators. Ladybirds' behavior is triggered by semiochemicals; their foraging behavior is kairomone driven, mating behavior is dependent on sex pheromones, and they refrain from oviposition after perceiving oviposition-deterring pheromones left by the footprints of the enemies. Temperature is a major abiotic factor followed by light which affects the development, reproduction, and demography of ladybirds. The biocontrol aspects of ladybirds preying on aphids, coccids, diaspids, and other pests are also reviewed and discussed.},

	abstract = {Plant breeding for resistance to agricultural pests is an essential element in the development of integrated crop management systems, however, the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying resistance are poorly understood. In this pilot study, we conducted a transcriptomic analysis of a resistant (R) and susceptible (S) variety of alfalfa, with (+A) or without (–A) aphids (totally four treatments). We used the resistant cultivar Zhongmu 1 and the susceptible cultivar Soca. A total of 3 549 mRNAs were differentially expressed, of which 1 738 up-regulated and 1 307 down-regulated genes were identified in S+A/S–A plants, while 543 up-regulated and 331 down-regulated genes were identified in the R+A/R–A plants. KEGG analysis mapped 112 and 546 differentially expressed genes to 8 and 17 substantially enriched pathways for Zhongmu 1 and Soca, respectively. Six shared pathways were linked to plant resistance traits, including phenylpropanoid biosynthesis associated with salicylic acid synthesis, and linoleic acid metabolism associated with both jasmonic acid and flavonoid biosynthesis. Ultimately, we proposed a preliminary regulatory mechanism of alfalfa cultivar resistance response to aphids feeding based on transcriptome analyses and published documents.},

Two cells were each specific for one of the two pheromone components, (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate (Z11-14:OAc) and (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetate (E11-14:OAc). Two strains of cornborers (Z and E) differ as to which of the two pheromone components is the main one. In both strains a large difference could be observed between the spike amplitudes elicited in the receptor cells by the two pheromone components, the main component always eliciting the large spike. In F1-hybrids (EZ) of these two strains, producing both pheromone components in similar quantities, the spike amplitudes were equal in the two pheromone-specific receptor cells. The third cell responded specifically to a behavioural antagonist. (Z)-9-tetradecenyl acetate (Z9-14:OAc) in both the parental and hybrid strains, and always showed the smallest spike amplitude. In a morphometric study, the outer dendritic segments were shown to differ more in diameter between the largest and second largest cell in the two parental strains than in the hybrid strain, while the smallest diameter cell did not differ between the different strains. These results imply that receptor cells with larger diameter produce spikes with greater amplitude. The data also show that all three types of receptor neurons display outer dendritic segments with strong variation in the diameter along the length of the segment, and with a pronounced taper towards the tip.},

The process of host finding and acceptance is divided into three phases: searching, landing and contact evaluation. Little is known about sensory aspect of searching, but visual stimuli play some role. Landing appears to be mediated primarily by visual cues, of which colour is the most important. Choice experiments using artificial leaves of identical spectral and chemical properties revealed little or no preference for shape or size of oviposition substrate. Contact evaluation depends on positive or negative chemical stimuli at the leaf surface. Oviposition stimulant was extracted from cabbage leaves and partially isolated by solvent extraction and a series of chromatographic separations. Chemical constituents other than glucosinolates appear to be responsible for the discriminatory behaviour of ovipositing butterflies. These stimulatory compounds are water-soluble but many are less polar than the glucosinolates, and may be active alone or in combinations. Identification of these compounds would greatly improve our understanding of the mechanism of host acceptance by cabbage butterflies.},

	abstract = {Host recognition is a key process in oligolectic bees but the mechanisms through which they find and recognize appropriate pollen host plant are not entirely clear. Hoplitis adunca is a monolectic bee collecting pollen only from Echium spp. (Boraginaceae). We aimed to test whether Echium vulgare floral scent plays a major role in the attraction of H. adunca females, and to identify components of E. vulgare scent that may be involved in this specific attraction. We used a combination of behavioral and chemical (GC/GC–MS, PTR-MS) analyses. In order to identify the chemical cues likely to be involved in the specific attraction of H. adunca, we compared the scent of fresh flowers, nectar, pollen, and whole plants of E. vulgare and Anchusa officinalis, another Boraginaceae, which does not attract H. adunca. H. adunca females were attracted to the scent of E. vulgare flowers when offered against a blank or against the scent of A. officinalis flowers. However, H. adunca females were not attracted to the scent of A. officinalis flowers when offered against a blank. The emission spectra of the two plant species differed markedly, as did the emission spectra of various flower components (pollen, nectar and whole flowers) within a species. Pollen presented a low volatile release, but emitted significantly higher amounts of mass 55 (butanal, 1,3-butadiene, or other volatiles of molecular mass 54), and mass 83 (hexanal, hexenols, hexenyl acetate, or other volatiles of molecular mass 82) in E. vulgare than in A. officinalis. Nectar produced a particular emission spectrum with high emission rates of masses 109 and 123. Mass 109 may likely correspond to 1,4-benzoquinone, a volatile specifically measured in E. vulgare in parallel studies to this one. The flower emission spectrum was mainly a combination of the pollen and the nectar scents, although it also contained additional volatile compounds such as those of mass 63 or mass 81. As for terpenes, E. vulgare emitted limonene, longicyclene, junipene, trans-caryophyllene and α-humulene, that were not detected in A. officinalis, and the most emitted monoterpenes were α-pinene, junipene and limonene whereas the most emitted terpenoid by A. officinalis was α-pinene. After identifying these chemical cues, olfactory/behavioural assays with specific volatiles and combinations of volatiles are necessary to understand the chemical interactions of the H. adunca-E. vulgare system.},

	abstract = {Plants resist attack by pathogens and herbivorous insects through constitutive and inducible defences. Based on differences in signalling pathways and spectra of effectiveness, different types of induced resistance have been defined. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) occurs in distal plant parts following localized infection by a necrotizing pathogen. It is controlled by a signalling pathway that depends upon the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and the regulatory protein NPR1. In contrast, induced systemic resistance (ISR) is induced by selected strains of non-pathogenic plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPR). ISR functions independently of SA, but requires NPR1 and is regulated by jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET). It is generally believed that induced resistance evolved to save energy under pathogen or insect-free conditions, although costs still arise when defences are activated following attack. Costs can arise from the allocation of resources to defence and away from plant growth and development, and there are also ecological costs which result from trade-offs between induced resistance and the plant's interaction with beneficial organisms e.g. mycorrhizal fungi. To date, few studies have examined the costs and trade-offs associated with induced resistance to pathogens. There is a clear need for long-term studies of costs and trade-offs associated with induced resistance in crops under commercial conditions. Without such information, the potential offered by induced resistance is unlikely to be realized.},

In olfactometer bioassays, S. noctilio females were attracted to a 4-component blend of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, trans-3-hexenyl acetate, linalool, and geraniol, while the addition of ρ-anisaldehyde to the blend was necessary for attraction of I. leucospoides females. The results of trap catches in field experiments confirmed that these fungal volatiles in combination with host tree volatiles are attractive to both species, although the release rate of the fungal volatiles is important.

	abstract = {More than half of the proteome from mandibular glands in caterpillars is represented by chemosensory proteins. Based on sequence similarity, these proteins are putative transporters of ligands to gustatory receptors in sensory organs of insects. We sought to determine whether these proteins are inducible by comparing, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the salivary (mandibular and labial) proteomes from caterpillars (Vanessa cardui) reared on different plants and artificial diet containing either bacteria or bacterial cell-walls. We included a treatment where the caterpillars were switched from feeding on artificial diet to plant material at some point in their development. Additionally, we evaluated the degree of overlap between the proteomes in the hemolymph-filled coelom and salivary glands of caterpillars reared on plant material. We found that the quality and quantity of the identified proteins differed clearly between hemolymph-filled coelome, labial and mandibular glands. Our results indicated that even after molting and two-day feeding on a new diet, protein production is affected by the previous food source used by the caterpillar. Candidate proteins involved in chemosensory perception by insects were detected: three chemosensory (CSPs) and two odorant-binding proteins (OBPs). Using the relative amounts of these proteins across tissues and treatments as criteria for their classification, we detected hemolymph- and mandibular gland-specific CSPs and observed that their levels were affected by caterpillar diet. Moreover, we could compare the protein and transcript levels across tissues and treatment for at least one CSP and one OBP. Therefore, we have identified specific isoforms for testing the role of CSPs and OBPs in plant and pathogen recognition. We detected catalase, immune-related protein and serine proteases and their inhibitors in high relative levels in the mandibular glands in comparison to the labial glands. These findings suggest that the mandibular glands of caterpillars may play an important role protecting the caterpillar from oxidative stress, pathogens and aiding in digestion. Contamination with hemolymph proteins during dissection of salivary glands from caterpillars may occur but it is not substantial since the proteomes from hemolymph, mandibular and labial glands were easily discriminated from each other by principal component analysis of proteomic data.},

This chapter presents a discussion on the evolution of plant biochemistry and the implications for physiology. Integrating physiological and biochemical knowledge can gain a functional understanding of plants. Plant cells are usually treated as unusual but only in so far as they have walls and chloroplasts. This emphasis on the commonality of the basic metabolism of organisms is helpful to those learning the subject but it does tend to limit conceptual approaches to biochemistry. The intimate connection between the physiology and biochemistry of plants is well established in the case of some aspects of physiology, especially where there are dramatic morphological and anatomical adaptations that make the links clear. Biochemical evolution overlaps with molecular evolution but can extend to consider more than one enzyme in a pathway and the control of that pathway. To achieve cost saving by inducible defence, three extra elements are needed: (1) a sensing system(s) that can detect the conditions that are an accurate indicator of a need for defence, (2) a regulatory step in the chemical production capacity, and (3) a linkage mechanism between the detection system and the regulatory system. Evidence is accumulating that plants possess all the three abilities, and evolution may have provided multiple ways of linking the three elements.},

	abstract = {The study of insect behavior involves the analysis of any and all activities performed by an insect in relation to its surrounding environment. Behavior genetics is the study of the underlying hereditary basis of the behavior. For many years, Mendelian genetic analyses were conducted on a few traits determined by one or a few genes, or quantitative genetic methods were used for traits determined by “many” genes. The sequencing of whole genomes and the use of molecular-genetic methods are revolutionizing the genetic analysis of insect behavior. However, one caveat should be recognized, based on a recent discovery about the discrepancy between behavior in the laboratory and in the field by the well-studied Drosophila melanogaster: the behavior you evaluate in the laboratory should be tested under conditions approaching the natural environment as much as possible or erroneous conclusions could be reached. Circadian behaviors, mating behavior, and learning in Drosophila have been dissected with the tools of molecular genetics and inter- and intraspecific comparisons can be made of the DNA sequences associated with these behaviors. The circadian clock of Drosophila involves several genes, including period+ (per+). Mutants of period+ influence activity patterns and other circadian rhythms, as well as altering song cycles in courting males. The per+ locus has been cloned and sequenced in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. After the per+ gene of D. simulans was inserted by P-element–mediated transformation into a strain of D. melanogaster that is arrhythmic, transgenic D. melanogaster males produced song cycles like those of D. simulans. As few as four amino acids may account for the differences in song rhythm of determined by the per+ locus. The timeless+, doubletime+, cycle+, cryptochrome+, and Clock+ genes are involved in the circadian clock. The clock involves transcription of the per+ and tim+ genes, followed by production of the PER and TIM proteins and subsequent negative feedback on self-transcription. Degradation of proteins then releases the negative feedback, allowing a new round of transcription, resulting in oscillations of RNA and protein. Drosophila learning mutants, such as dunce and couch potato, are providing insights into the fundamental processes involved in short-term, intermediate, long-term, and anesthetic-resistant learning in insects and other organisms. Analysis of sleep behaviors in D. melanogaster may offer clues to sleep in humans (Shaw and Franken 2003). The discovery of “personalities” of diverse insects changes our interpretations of insect behavior. Analyses of behaviors that are determined by many genes are being revolutionized by the use of molecular-genetic methods and whole-genome sequencing projects. It now is possible to map the number and location of genes or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting complex traits by correlating their inheritance with a variety of DNA markers and by conducting microarray analyses.},

	abstract = {Cedar (Cedrela fissilis) is a major timber species native to South America that has suffered frequent impacts from illegal harvesting. Cultivation efforts have experienced recurrent failures due to the action of the mahogany shoot borer Hypsipyla grandella, which, when attacking the plants in the first years of growth, inflicts negative effects on the commercial use of this timber. One of the methods used to reduce attacks by this insect is planting cedar in shaded areas, but the factor that makes shaded plants to be less attacked is still unknown. Considering that variation in photosynthetically active radiation can alter the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from plants, our hypothesis is that shading cedar plants alters their production of volatile compounds, including those that affect host location by H. grandella adults. To check this hypothesis, the authors used an air-entrainment system to collect VOCs emitted by cedar under different levels of artificial shading (50\%, 30\%, 15\%) and full sunlight. The influence of the volatiles emitted by cedar plants on H. grandella was then assessed through electroantennographic/GC assays. One volatile compound, methyl salicylate, which was found to experience enhanced emission in shaded cedar plants, was then subjected to a field experiment to evaluate its influence on host location by H. grandella moths. From thirty VOCs emitted by the tested cedar plants, nine exhibited enhanced emission when plants were shaded: methyl salicylate, methyl-5-methylhexanoate, the monoterpenes α-pinene and eucalyptol, the homoterpenes (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT) and (E-E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene (TMTT) the sesquiterpenes, β-caryophyllene, β-cubebene and an unidentified sesquiterpene. Antennal response from H. grandella female and male antennae was observed to four volatile compounds, nonanal, decanal, methyl salicylate, and β-caryophyllene, when stimulated with the air-entrainment cedar plant extracts. A synthetic blend comprising these four compounds also elicited antennal responses from H. grandella. Field studies showed that plants treated with methyl salicylate exhibited a lower rate of damage by H. grandella caterpillars. These results indicate the potential of this semiochemical as a management tool for H. grandella in cedar cultivations.},

	abstract = {The processing of olfactory information in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say, was studied by recording responses of olfactory neurones intracellularly in the deutocerebrum. Response characteristics of neurones in this first relay station of the olfactory pathway were measured when the antennae were stimulated with five general green leaf volatiles, i.e. cis-3-hexen-1-ol, trans-2-hexenal, cis-3-hexenyl acetate, trans-2-hexen-1-ol and 1-hexanol. These compounds are part of the so-called green odour of potato, whose defined composition is essential for the beetle's host plant finding. The response spectra of deutocerebral neurones can be divided roughly into two classes: one class containing neurones which are not very specific for the tested compounds, and another class with highly specialized neurones. Their different responses to a potato leaf extract suggest two channels for the processing of olfactory information in the antennal lobe: one channel for the detection of the presence of green leaf odour components, and another one for an evaluation of the component ratios.},

	abstract = {White clover (Trifolium repens) is an important pasture legume but is often difficult to sustain in a mixed sward because, among other things, of the damage to roots caused by the soil-dwelling larval stages of S. lepidus. Locating the root nodules on the white clover roots is crucial for the survival of the newly hatched larvae. This paper presents a numerical model to simulate the movement of newly hatched S. lepidus larvae towards the root nodules, guided by a chemical signal released by the nodules. The model is based on the diffusion–chemotaxis equation. Experimental observations showed that the average speed of the larvae remained approximately constant, so the diffusion–chemotaxis model was modified so that the larvae respond only to the gradient direction of the chemical signal but not its magnitude. An individual-based lattice Boltzmann method was used to simulate the movement of individual larvae, and the parameters required for the model were estimated from the measurement of larval movement towards nodules in soil scanned using X-ray microtomography. The model was used to investigate the effects of nodule density, the rate of release of chemical signal, the sensitivity of the larvae to the signal, and the random foraging of the larvae on the movement and subsequent survival of the larvae. The simulations showed that the most significant factors for larval survival were nodule density and the sensitivity of the larvae to the signal. The dependence of larval survival rate on nodule density was well fitted by the Michealis–Menten kinetics.},

Various sensilla types were identified and their mean lengths were determined. Three types of sensilla were observed on the pedicel of the antenna: sensillum trichodeum, sensillum chaeticum, and sensillum basiconicum. Subsequently, three sensilla basiconica and one sensillum styloconicum were reported on the flagellum. Mouthparts carried six types of sensilla at various sites. Six pairs of sensilla chaetica and a pair of epipharyngeal setae were located on the labrum. On the maxillae, the cardo bore one sensillum chaeticum while the galea carried two pairs of sensilla basiconica and one pair of sensilla styloconica. The maxillary palp carried eight short sensilla basiconica, sensillum digitiformium, and sensillum placodeum. The labial palp bore long sensillum styloconicum and short chaeticum. The findings provide useful information that may help to understand the olfactory and gustatory perceptions that influence larval preferences for plants as a source of food.},

The paradigm consisted of pairing an aversive stimulus (pseudopredator) with a conditioned chemical stimulus (shrimp mixture). Four artificial mixtures (crab, mullet, oyster, and shrimp), each at 0.05 and 0.5 mM, were presented to the animals prior to, during, and following conditioning to both concentrations of the shrimp mixture. Pre- vs postconditioning changes in three types of behavioral responses (and an index based on a composite of these three behaviors) were used as indicators of learned aversions. Olfactory discrimination abilities were determined by comparing the aversion to the conditioned mixture with the aversions to the three nonconditioned mixtures. A high degree of associative learning was attained after 10 pairings of the pseudopredator with the shrimp mixture over a period of 5 test days. According to the aversion index, animals conditioned to shrimp mixture perceived crab mixture as being more similar to shrimp mixture than were mullet and oyster mixtures, but all three nonconditoned mixtures were perceived as being significantly different from the shrimp mixture. These results are in concordance with results of a cluster analysis based on the mixture compositions, which indicates that shrimp and crab mixtures are compositionally similar, while mullet and oyster mixtures are compositionally distinct from the shrimp mixture.},

We tested the hypotheses that (1) G. ashmeadi uses chemical volatiles as cues to find hosts, (2) its success in host finding varies among plant species, and (3) the release of semiochemicals is systemically induced by GWSS feeding and oviposition. Using a glass Y-tube olfactometer, we determined G. ashmeadi’s preference for volatiles of infested versus uninfested lemon, grapevine, red-tip photinia, and crape myrtle plants. The parasitoid’s first choice to, its residence time, and the number of visits per Y-tube arm were used to assess its plant choice. G. ashmeadi chose the infested lemon, red-tip photinia, or grapevine plant significantly more often (62\%, 67\%, and 63\%, respectively) than uninfested hosts, whereas they chose infested and uninfested crape myrtle equally often (49\%). Females spent more time in and made more visits to the olfactometer arm connected to the infested plant than to the arm connected to the uninfested plant, except when testing crape myrtle. When testing for a systemic plant response to GWSS infestation, only infested lemon was significantly more attractive to the parasitoids than was an uninfested plant. These results suggest that G. ashmeadi females use chemical volatiles as cues to find GWSS egg masses and that host finding success varies among GWSS host plants. Some plants used by GWSS as oviposition hosts may serve as an escape from parasitization by G. ashmeadi and act as reservoirs for new GWSS individuals.},

Numbers of plant landings by pre-mating adult females was much lower than for post-mating females. In addition, the pre-mating females showed no clear preference for the host or non-host plants. These findings suggest that pre-mating females do not actively search for host plants. In contrast numbers of landings increased in post-mating females, immediately after mating, and there was a markedly higher preference for cabbage than lettuce. When plant odors were blocked by covering the plants with transparent or black polyethylene bags there was no difference in the landing preference of adult post-mating females, indicating that the adult females were unable to distinguish between cabbage and lettuce when their olfactory sense was blocked. The greater number of adult females landing on the plants covered with transparent polyethylene bags than those covered with black bags indicated that the females recognize the plants visually. When the transparent and black polyethylene bags had holes that enabled olfactory signals to reach the females, there was a clear preference for cabbage over lettuce. These results together with a preference for lettuce plants treated with cabbage volatile extracts than lettuce plants treated with lettuce volatile extracts indicate that the adult females detect host plants using their olfactory sense.},

	abstract = {Summary
Biological control of soil-borne pathogens comprises the decrease of inoculum or of the disease producing activity of a pathogen through one or more mechanisms. Interest in biological control of soil-borne plant pathogens has increased considerably in the last few decades, because it may provide control of diseases that cannot or only partly be managed by other control strategies. Recent advances in microbial and molecular techniques have significantly contributed to new insights in underlying mechanisms by which introduced bacteria function. Colonization of plant roots is an essential step for both soil-borne pathogenic and beneficial rhizobacteria. Colonization patterns showed that rhizobacteria act as biocontrol agents or as growth-promoting bacteria form microcolonies or biofilms at preferred sites of root exudation. Such microcolonies are sites for bacteria to communicate with each other (quorum sensing) and to act in a coordinated manner. Elicitation of induced systemic resistance (ISR) by plant-associated bacteria was initially demonstrated using Pseudomonas spp. and other Gram-negative bacteria. Several strains of the species Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, B. pasteurii, B. cereus, B. pumilus, B. mycoides, and B. sphaericus elicit significant reductions in the incidence or severity of various diseases on a diversity of hosts. Elicitation of ISR by these strains has been demonstrated in greenhouse or field trials on tomato, bell pepper, muskmelon, watermelon, sugar beet, tobacco, Arabidopsis sp., cucumber, loblolly pine, and two tropical crops (long cayenne pepper and green kuang futsoi). Protection resulting from ISR elicited by Bacillus spp. has been reported against leaf-spotting fungal and bacterial pathogens, systemic viruses, a crown-rotting fungal pathogen, root-knot nematodes, and a stem-blight fungal pathogen as well as damping-off, blue mold, and late blight diseases. This progress will lead to a more efficient use of these strains which is worthwhile approach to explore in context of biocontrol strategies.},

A time course experiment investigated the emission of volatiles throughout the period of larval development following infestation. The volatiles consisted mainly of esters, a few aldehydes, and the terpene α-farnesene. Infested apples emitted the same compounds as healthy apples. The quantities of volatiles released were much higher for infested as compared to healthy fruits for an initial three day period. Following this period there was a decrease in volatile emissions (days 6–9), eventually declining back to the levels emitted from healthy apples or below by 9–21 days after infestation. In a separate experiment, the volatile emissions from healthy and artificially damaged fruits were compared to those from herbivore damaged fruits for each of the five larval instars of C. pomonella. The results from the discriminant analysis indicate that the most effective induction of volatiles occurred when fruits were infested with first instar larvae. Induction by first instar larvae was generally higher than after infestation by later instars, and for most compounds it also exceeded the emission from artificially damaged fruits.},

In the silkworm Bombyx mori, the OBPs are subdivided into three main subfamilies; pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs), general odorant-binding proteins (GOBPs) and antennal-binding proteins (ABPs). We used the MotifSearch algorithm to search for genes encoding putative OBPs in B. mori and found 13, many fewer than are found in the genomes of fruit flies and mosquitoes. The 13 genes include seven new ABP-like OBPs as well as the previously identified PBPs (three), GOBPs (two) and ABPx. Quantitative examination of transcript levels showed that BmorPBP1, BmorGOBP1, BmorGOBP2 and BmorABPx are expressed at very high levels in the antennae and so could be involved in olfaction. A new two-phase binding assay, along with other established assays, showed that BmorPBP1, BmorPBP2, BmorGOBP2 and BmorABPx all bind to the B. mori sex pheromone component (10E,12Z)-hexadecadien-1-ol (bombykol). BmorPBP1, BmorPBP2 and BmorABPx also bind the pheromone component (10E,12Z)-hexadecadienal (bombykal) equally well, whereas BmorGOBP2 can discriminate between bombykol and bombykal. X-ray structures show that when bombykol is bound to BmorGOBP2 it adopts a different conformation from that found when it binds to BmorPBP1. Binding to BmorGOBP2 involves hydrogen bonding to Arg110 rather than to Ser56 as found for BmorPBP1.},

Soil moisture is amongst the most important factors influencing root herbivores, though this is tightly linked with soil temperature. Root herbivores have evolved behavioural (e.g. cell construction and burrowing) and physiological (e.g. cuticular pumps and spiracle valves) mechanisms to prevent desiccation and suffocation. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is higher within the soil than in the air, and hence, root feeders are physiologically adapted to high concentrations. Indirectly, root herbivores can benefit from elevated atmospheric CO2 through stimulation of root growth, though studies are scarce. Similarly, in an agricultural context, fertilisation usually affects root herbivores positively through improved nutritional quality of host plants. Soil texture and structure is critical for root herbivore movement, and compacted soils cause significant mortality. As a consequence, many maternal insects specifically oviposit in soils amenable to offspring movement.},

The 10 most abundant compound groups emitted by P. tabuliformis were classified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The dominant monoterpenoid compounds emitted were α-pinene, β-myrcene, α-farnesene and limonene. The diurnal emission rate of BVOCs changed with temperature and light intensity, with dynamic analysis of BVOCs emissions revealing that their emission rates were more affected by temperature than light. The variation in monoterpene emission rates was consistent with estimates of Pn, gs and Tr. Basal emission rates (at 30 °C,) of the main BVOCs ranged from 0.006 to 0.273 μg  −1/(hr g), while the basal ER standardization coefficients ranged from 0.049 to 0.144 °C−1.

A series of experiments was performed to explore the olfactory mechanism underlying the oviposition behavior of A. japonicus. First, a transcriptomic analysis was performed on the antennae of A. japonicus, and the resulting assemblies led to the generation of 70,473 unigenes. Subsequently, 21,368 unigenes were matched to known proteins, 48 odorant receptors (ORs) (including Orco) and 13 antennal ionotropic receptors (IRs) (including the co-receptors IR8a and IR25a) were identified and predicted to form complete open reading frames (ORFs). The FPKM (fragments per Kb per million reads) values and RT-PCR results showed that AjapOrco, AjapOR10, AjapOR27, AjapOR33 and AjapOR35 were either highly abundant or expressed specifically in the olfactory organs. Furthermore, AjapOrco silencing resulted in a significant decrease in both the parasitism rate and the host-seeking time of A. japonicus, whereas dsRNA injection showed that IR8a and IR25a did not produce significant behavioral changes, suggesting that the oviposition behavior of A. japonicus is more reliant on OR-based pathways than IR-based pathways. Our previous GC-MS data derived twenty-nine compounds which were abundent from these host plants and host insects. We performed electrophysiological and oviposition assays on A. japonicus, and eight odorants were found to elicit a significant electroantennogram (EAG) response. Among these odorants, β-Caryophyllene, Undecane, (E)-α-Farnesene (+)-Aromadendrene and Cis-3-Hexen-ol had strong attractant effects on oviposition, whereas 2-Ethyl-1-Hexan-ol, Ethyl Acetate and α-Caryophyllene had a strong repellant effects. Thus, these chemicals might influence oviposition guidance/repulsion behavior in A. japonicus. To further explore the target ORs that are tuned to the functional odorants, the nine candidate ORs described above were silenced by RNA interference, and the results showed that a large decrease in the EAG response of all the tested functional odorants in the AjapOrco-silencing group. In addition, the AjapOR35-silencing group showed a significant decrease in the EAG response to β-Caryophyllene and (E)-α-Farnesene, indicating that AjapOR35 is tuned to these two oviposition attractants β-Caryophyllene and (E)-α-Farnesene. Further binary-choice oviposition assays showed that the oviposition attractant effect of β-Caryophyllene and (E)-α-Farnesene vanished after AjapOR35 was silenced, indicating that the emission of these attractants from host plants can guide A. japonicus to locate eggs for ovipositioning and indicated that AjapOR35 is correlated with the olfactory detection oviposition behavior of this species. This study provides a better understanding of the molecular basis and functional chemicals underlying the oviposition behavior of A. japonicus, and the results may help improve biocontrol approaches.},

	abstract = {Earwigs protect themselves against predators using pincer-like cerci and/or malodorous exudates secreted from abdominal glands. Little is known about the chemistry of these secretions and their potential functions. However, because earwigs live in aggregations and overwinter in soil, they are exposed to high microbial loads throughout their lifecycle, and we therefore hypothesized that the secretions are used not only to deter predators but also to combat pathogens and parasites in their environment. We analyzed the defensive secretions of the European earwig Forficula auricularia, the short-winged earwig Apterygida media and the woodland earwig Chelidurella guentheri by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The secretions of all three species contained 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone and 2-ethyl-1,4-benzoquinone, whereas A. media also produced 2,3-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone and 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone. The latter has not been identified in the exudates of insects before. The composition and/or quantity of these components were species-specific and partially sex-specific. All secretions showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as two entomopathogenic fungi. Furthermore, the secretion of F. auricularia displayed nematicidal activity against Caenorhabditis elegans. Our data support the hypothesis that earwig secretions are multifunctional, serving both to deter predators and sanitize the microenvironment.},

These critically important species forage for food, mates and hosts in complex environments, relying on a variety of stimuli including visual, olfactory, tactile and vibrational cues. In these contexts, learning is often key to optimizing fitness. Here we review current knowledge on the associative learning abilities of both immature and adult parasitoids, specifically learning associated with different kinds of stimuli: (i) reward-associated visual cues, such as colors, shapes and damage patterns; (ii) reward-associated chemical cues, including long- and short-range olfactory cues originating from the plant-host complex or from the host itself, as well as exogenous, nonhost-related odors, and (iii) danger-associated chemical cues that can trigger avoidance behavior. We highlight how the inclusion of associative training with visual and olfactory stimuli in mass-rearing protocols might be exploited to enhance the efficiency of biological control agents against a given target pest. We also discuss the genetic, physiological and ecological factors that can impact parasitoid learning and suggest ways they might be manipulated to optimize rearing conditions for biological control objectives.},

Such imprint strongly relies on plant genetic traits but can be modulated by exogenous environmental factors. In order to enlarge knowledge on the genetic control underlying aroma biogenesis in olive (Olea europaea L.) drupes, in the present study we characterized one member of ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE gene family. The ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE activities act along Lipoxygenase enzymatic cascade by interconverting aldehydes into alcohols. The temporal expression pattern of O. europaea ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE was monitored by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction in drupes at different developmental stages (i.e. from light green phase to ripening stage) of two olive cultivars widely used for olive and oil production. The expression of a known LIPOXYGENASE gene (ACG56281.1) was jointly monitored as marker of drupe development. Results were analysed in relation to the spectrum of volatile compounds developed from crushed drupes estimated by Solid-Phase Micro-Extraction method in-line with a Gas Chromatograph/ion trap Mass Spectrometer. The obtained results showed that both cultivar and maturation stage impact on the expression of O. europaea ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE gene which in the pathway is co-ordinately modulated with LIPOXYGENASE expression. The transcriptional differences between cultivars appeared to be related to variation of metabolite contents at early developmental stages. The joint role of genes acting in the Lipoxygenase pathway as molecular markers for flavour characteristic of olive drupes is discussed.},

	abstract = {Studies of insect identified neurons over the past 25 years have provided some of the very best data on sensorimotor integration; tracing information flow from sensory to motor networks. General principles have emerged that have increased the sophistication with which we now understand both sensory processing and motor control. Two overarching themes have emerged from studies of identified sensory interneurons. First, within a species, there are profound differences in neuronal organization associated with both the sex and the social experience of the individual. Second, single neurons exhibit some surprisingly rich examples of computational sophistication in terms of (a) temporal dynamics (coding superimposed upon circadian and shorter-term rhythms), and also (b) what Kenneth Roeder called ‘neural parsimony’: that optimal information can be encoded, and complex acts of sensorimotor coordination can be mediated, by small ensembles of cells. Insect motor systems have proven to be relatively complex, and so studies of their organization typically have not yielded completely defined circuits as are known from some other invertebrates. However, several important findings have emerged. Analysis of neuronal oscillators for rhythmic behavior have delineated a profound influence of sensory feedback on interneuronal circuits: they are not only modulated by feedback, but may be substantially reconfigured. Additionally, insect motor circuits provide potent examples of neuronal restructuring during an organism's lifetime, as well as insights on how circuits have been modified across evolutionary time. Several areas where future advances seem likely to occur include: molecular genetic analyses, neuroecological syntheses, and neuroinformatics — the use of digital resources to organize databases with information on identified nerve cells and behavior.},

	abstract = {Allelopathy is described as the interference to plant growth resulting from chemical interactions among plants and other organisms mediated through release of plant-produced bioactive secondary metabolites referred to as allelochemicals. A number of mechanisms have been studied for the release of allelochemicals from various plant tissues including volatilization or leaching from aerial parts, exudation from roots and decomposition of plant residues in soil. Despite differences in biological activity and mode of action, related compounds commonly share similar biosynthetic pathways while some classes of metabolites can be produced using diverse biosynthetic pathways. Recently considerable research has also been undertaken to critically understand the role of allelochemicals in plant succession and plant invasion in native and nonnative ecosystem. In addition, numerous studies have been performed on the selection and utilization of weed suppressive crops and their residues for weed management in sustainable agriculture systems. A better understanding of allelochemical production with respect to plant defence strategies, both physical and chemical, may also allow us to better protect and manage developing crops, limit the spread of invasive weeds, preserve native plant stands and create strategies for allelochemical development and application as novel pesticides. The use of sensitive analytical techniques associated with performance of metabolomics in concert with other omics technologies has led to new advances in the identification of unique allelochemicals, the biosynthetic pathways associated with their production, their complex role(s) in the soil rhizosphere and their production as impacted by a changing climate. Identification of novel plant metabolites, including allelochemicals, may result in a source of biologically based pesticides through the provision of complementary structures for future synthesis and as an aid in the development of new molecular target sites.},

	abstract = {Aim of the study
Characterization and comparative analysis of the main VOCs (volatile organic compounds) present in the smoke of 11 experimentally combusted plant species used as incense in Shaxi, Southwest China. Substances which may be responsible for the pleasant smell of the smokes as well as substances with a potential pharmacological activity are discussed.
Materials and methods
We adopt the dynamic headspace sorption method for the collection of smoke samples as a novel methodological approach in ethnobotany. The VOCs were identified using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Principal component analysis and canonical discriminant analysis were performed using PASW statistics (Version 18.0.2).
Results
Among the identified compounds were 10 monoterpenoids, 7 sesquiterpenoids, 6 linear hydrocarbons, 6 methoxy phenolics, 2 benzenoids, 2 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and 2 fatty acids. Based on their volatile profiles, the species are well clustered intraspecifically and separated interspecifically. The most abundant among the compounds potentially responsible for the pleasant smells of the smokes are methyl salicylate (12.28±3.90\%) for Gaultheria fragrantissima leaves, δ-cadinene (15.58±2.29\%) for Juniperus squamata wood, and α-Pinene for Cupressus funebris branches (9.16±7.73\%) and Pistacia weinmanniifolia branches (19.52±8.66\%). A couple of substances found are known for pharmacological activity, such as methylsalycilate, beta-caryophyllene and cedrol.
Conclusions
The species used by the local people in Shaxi for incense differ clearly with respect to the chemical compounds of their smoke. Further, incense contains substances, which are of pharmacological interest and might support medicinal uses of smoke. Cedrol with its pleasant smell and sedative properties may be an important factor why specific plants are chosen as incense. Our findings support the idea that the effects of the use of incense as well as medicinal smoke depend on both, the cultural as well as the pharmacological context.},

However, the acquisition of new information could involve defects in retrieving previously learned information (i.e. forgetting), a process known as retroactive interference, which diminishes learning capacities. In this study, we evaluated the learning capacity and the impact of retroactive interference during host searching by ecological specialist and generalist phytophagous insects. We examined whether the generalist aphid, Myzus persicae s. str., and the tobacco-specialized subspecies, Myzus persicae nicotianae differ in (1) learning capacity, or (2) retroactive interference during host selection, and (3) whether the learning-associated foraging gene (for) is differentially expressed. Differences in learning capacity and retroactive interference were assessed in bioassays using rearing hosts and alternative hosts followed by choices between or transferences to rearing or alternative hosts. During the pre-alighting phase of host searching, the generalist aphid showed attraction to the alternative host after 12h of experience, while the specialist showed no attraction to the alternative host regardless of the amount of time on the plant. The retroactive interference experiments showed that when aphids were exposed to an alternative host for different periods, odour attraction to the rearing host persisted in the generalist after 72h of experience on the alternative host, whereas in the specialist the attraction to the rearing host was lost after 12h of experience on the alternative host. During the post-alighting phase of host searching, both taxa performed better on their rearing hosts, but in the specialist aphid, a short period on the alternative host reversed this behaviour. In addition, the specialist showed lower levels of gene for expression, which could be associated with the differences in learning performance. Herein we present further evidence of differences in learning capacities between a specialist and a generalist aphid, which may influence the process of host searching and evolution of ecological specialization.},

The process of chemoreception is mediated by a series of proteins, including odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), gustatory receptors (GRs), odorant receptors (ORs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), chemosensory proteins (CSPs) and sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs). The tephritid stem gall fly, Procecidochares utilis Stone, is a type of egg parasitic insect, which is an effective biological control agent for the invasive weed Ageratina adenophora in many countries. However, the study of molecular components related to the olfactory system of P. utilis has not been investigated. Here, we conducted the developmental transcriptome (egg, first-third instar larva, pupa, female and male adult) of P. utilis using next-generation sequencing technology and identified a total of 133 chemosensory genes, including 40 OBPs, 29 GRs, 24 ORs, 28 IRs, 6 CSPs, and 6 SNMPs. The sequences of these candidate chemosensory genes were confirmed by BLAST, and phylogenetic analysis was performed. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed that the expression levels of the candidate OBPs varied at the different developmental stages of P. utilis with most OBPs expressed mainly in the pupae, female and male adults but scarcely in eggs and larvae, which was consistent with the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis using the fragments per kilobase per million fragments (FPKM) value. Our results provide a significant contribution towards the knowledge of the set of chemosensory proteins and help advance the use of P. utilis as biological control agents.},

The concept of IPM, introduced in Chapter 5, in urban landscapes uses knowledge of both pest and plant biology to reduce or prevent damage and loss using methods that are consistent with stewardship of the environmental and our natural resources. Someone unfamiliar with IPM may ask the question, “Why not just use insecticides?” Insecticides are fast acting and relatively easy to use, but they are not a good option for every situation, nor do they provide long-term management options necessary in some situations. Insecticides are short-term interventions to reduce populations of pest insects and mites. The practice of IPM is done through biological, cultural, and chemical controls. Therefore, IPM is not equivalent with organic, nor does it mean no insecticides. This chapter will discuss biological and cultural approaches, and Chapter 9 will focus on the chemical control.},

In the European Union, the EFSA Guidance Document introduces the rationale that GMPs, as well as their newly produced metabolites, represent the potential stressor to be evaluated during ERA. As a consequence, during several phases of ERA for cultivation purposes, it is considered necessary to use whole plants or plant parts in experimental protocols. The importance of in planta studies as a strategy to address impacts of GMPs on non-target organisms is demonstrated, to evaluate both effects due to the intended modification in plant phenotype (e.g. expression of Cry proteins) and effects due to unintended modifications in plant phenotype resulting from the transformation process (e.g. due to somaclonal variations or pleiotropic effects). In planta tests are also necessary for GMPs in which newly expressed metabolites cannot easily be studied in vitro. This paper reviews the scientific literature supporting the choice of in planta studies as a fundamental tool in ERA of GMPs in cultivation dossiers; the evidence indicates they can realistically mimic the ecological relationships occurring in their receiving environments and provide important insights into the biology and sustainable management of GMPs.},

This was done for peppermint, spearmint, and rosemary, the shoots of which were added as soil amendments at a concentration of 4\% (w/w). We sampled at 0, 30 and 60 days after the plants’ incorporation into the soil. We distilled the soil mixtures and found the essential oil content to be reduced, in the spearmint and peppermint treatments, by approximately 90\% after 30 days. In the rosemary treatment, it was reduced only at the last sampling to about 50\% of its initial value. Essential oil composition changed dramatically with time. The relative contribution of monoterpenoids, initially about 90\% in spearmint and peppermint, fell to 45\% and 20\%, respectively, after 60 days. Sesquiterpenes and sesquiterenoids increased both in number and relative contribution. Percent participation of β-caryophyllene increased more than 15-fold in the spearmint and peppermint essential oils, and compounds that were not detected at first appeared at later stages of the decomposition process (after 30 or 60 days). In contrast, monoterpenoids made the bulk of rosemary oil at all sampling times, with only a minor reduction (about 5\%) at the end of the experimental period. In a second experiment, where rosemary was let to decompose for one year, quantitative and qualitative analysis confirmed persistence of its oil for long in the soil environment. These results can explain the different effects on crop plants that have been reported for rosemary and spearmint soil mixtures and provide further insight for the potential of aromatic plants to find novel uses in agriculture.},

Insect odorant binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs) transport chemicals and play critical roles in chemoreception. Studies on N. viridula OBPs and CSPs should increase our overall understandings on chemosensory systems and chemical ecology of stink bugs, which may lead to improved pest control. In this study, we identified candidate genes encoding putative OBPs and CSPs in N. viridula by generating transcriptomes from dissected antennae and mouthparts. In total, the 42 unigenes were identified coding for OBPs (34 Classic OBPs and eight Plus-C OBPs) and 13 unigenes coding for CSPs. Expression profiles of OBP- and CSP -encoding genes were compared between antennae and mouthparts based on FKPM values. Candidates for antenna-predominant OBPs and CSPs were selected for real-time quantitative PCR analyses. Analyses of tissue expression profiles revealed that 17 OBP-encoding genes, and four CSP genes were primarily expressed in antennae, suggesting their putative roles in perception of volatiles. The sex-biased expression patterns of these antenna-predominant genes suggested that they may have important functions in reproduction of the insect. This is a systematic analysis on OBPs and CSPs in a stink bug, providing a comprehensive resource for future functional studies not only for N. viridula, but also for other stink bugs as well.},

Headspace solid-phase microextraction and steam distillation extraction were used to collect the volatile fractions. Samples were analyzed using one-dimensional gas chromatography (1D-GC) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) associated with a quadrupole and a time-of-flight mass detectors. Results showed that the analytical capabilities of 1D-GC are partially limited by the separation power of the columns. The higher sensibility and the absence of peak skewing of the time-of-flight mass analyzer, with the use of automated peak finding and deconvolution algorithms, allowed for the detection of trace components with qualitative full spectra and the extraction of true mass spectra from coeluting compounds, promoting their reliable identification and thus significantly improving results obtained by 1D-GC/MS, when using a quadrupole mass analyzer. The use of GC×GC resulted in enhanced separation efficiency and increased signal to noise ratio (sensitivity) of the analytes, maximizing mass spectra quality and improving compound detection and identification. This work shows the use of 1D-GC/ToFMS for the analysis of pine needles volatiles, achieving the detection of 177 compounds, that is more than twice the number previously identified by standard 1D-GC/MS. The analysis by GC×GC for the same sample allowed the detection of 212 compounds.

Integrating the nontoxic mechanisms deriving from natural plant compounds into insect pest management seems quite appealing—the more so because such mechanisms are present and available wherever plants grow. Plants produce a wide range of secondary compounds that may act as signals—that is, allelochemicals—mediating interactions between insects and plants. Among those, two functional categories of allelochemicals are particularly relevant to insect–plant interactions: kairomones are used by insects to locate a host plant and allomones confer protection to the plants that produce them. This chapter discusses several aspects of using such secondary plant compounds as attractants, repellents, or deterrents to manipulate the host selection and acceptance behavior of thysanopteran pest species in the framework of either existing or novel biological control or Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies. The chapter provides an overview of the perspectives and problems frequently met in the development of environment friendly pest control methods.},

	abstract = {Pseudoflower formation is arguably the rarest outcome of a plant-fungus interaction. Here we report on a novel putative floral mimicry system in which the pseudoflowers are composed entirely of fungal tissues in contrast to modified leaves documented in previous mimicry systems. Pseudoflowers on two perennial Xyris species (yellow-eyed grass, X. setigera and X. surinamensis) collected from savannas in Guyana were produced by Fusarium xyrophilum, a novel Fusarium species. These pseudoflowers mimic Xyris flowers in gross morphology and are ultraviolet reflective. Axenic cultures of F. xyrophilum produced two pigments that had fluorescence emission maxima in light ranges that trichromatic insects are sensitive to and volatiles known to attract insect pollinators. One of the volatiles emitted by F. xyrophilum cultures (i.e., 2-ethylhexanol) was also detected in the head space of X. laxifolia var. iridifolia flowers, a perennial species native to the New World. Results of microscopic and PCR analyses, combined with examination of gross morphology of the pseudoflowers, provide evidence that the fungus had established a systemic infection in both Xyris species, sterilized them and formed fungal pseudoflowers containing both mating type idiomorphs. Fusarium xyrophilum cultures also produced the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and the cytokinin isopentenyl adenosine (iPR). Field observations revealed that pseudoflowers and Xyris flowers were both visited by bees. Together, the results suggest that F. xyrophilum pseudoflowers are a novel floral mimicry system that attracts insect pollinators, via visual and olfactory cues, into vectoring its conidia, which might facilitate outcrossing of this putatively heterothallic fungus and infection of previously uninfected plants.},

	abstract = {Understanding how animals learn is crucial to interpreting animal behaviour. Flower-visiting insects, such as bees and parasitoids, are excellent animal models to study visual and olfactory learning, including memory phenomena. The diversity of resources flower-visiting insects exploit predisposes them to learn and remember the colours, shapes and odours associated with rewarding experiences (e.g. flowers), allowing them to focus on the most rewarding resources. Recent research has shown that nectar-living microbes release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to overall flower scent. Nevertheless, little is known about the extent to which nectar microbiota mediate insect learning of floral preferences. In this study, we investigated whether VOCs produced by nectar microbes serve as a learning cue to parasitoids and how long any developed preference is maintained. Experiments were performed using the generalist aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi and three nectar yeasts, including the nectar specialist Metschnikowia reukaufii and the generalist species Hanseniaspora uvarum and Sporobolomyces roseus. Results showed that naïve parasitoids had an innate preference for nectar fermented by the nectar specialist M. reukaufii, but not by the other two yeasts which had either a neutral (H. uvarum) or deterrent (S. roseus) effect. When parasitoids were conditioned with yeast-fermented nectar, they were strongly attracted to their odours 2 and 24h after conditioning, but not after 48h. Furthermore, when parasitoids were conditioned to one yeast-fermented nectar, they also showed increased attraction to other yeast-fermented nectars. This generalization suggests that their learning ability may have broader ecological consequences. However, this generalized response to other yeast VOCs lasted for only 2h. We conclude that parasitoids show conditioned responses to the scent of yeast-fermented nectar, and yeasts, therefore, may play an important but understudied role in shaping their foraging behaviour.},

To consider whether hominins could have used plant extracts as a precursor or alternative to smoke, we review the ethnographic, ethnobotanical, and plant chemical ecology literature to examine how humans use plants in combination with, and independently of, smoke during honey collection. Plant secondary compounds are diverse in their physiological and behavioral effects on bees and differ fundamentally from those of smoke. Plants containing these chemicals are widespread and prove to be remarkably effective in facilitating honey collection by honey hunters and beekeepers worldwide. While smoke may be superior as a deterrent to bees, plant extracts represent a plausible precursor or alternative to the use of smoke during honey collection by hominins. Smoke is a sufficient but not necessary condition for acquiring honey in amounts exceeding those typically obtained by chimpanzees, suggesting that significant honey consumption could have predated the control of fire.},

The chapter discusses the impact that plants have on insect pests and weed pests. Generally, the survival of the pests depends on the habitat in which they live. If the environment is unfavorable, they cannot survive. Whether it is insect pests or weed pests, all need favorable environment to survive. For pests, the most important part of their habitat is the plants on which they live and eat and on which depends their survival. In the agroecosystem in which one lives, 22\% of all known species are green plants and about 26\% are plant-feeding insect species. As plant-feeding insect species are so huge in number, one needs to adopt suitable measure to protect one's crops. Plants provide important information about the host location; so one needs to be very attentive in identifying the cues through which host location can be identified. The chapter provides an overview on ways in which plants are directly or indirectly influenced by parasitoids. It illustrates the interactions that take place between parasitoids and their environments.},

Furthermore, endogenous metabolites trigger attractive or repellent responses in root feeders, indicating that they may specifically fine-tune food uptake to meet their dietary needs.

To address this question, I will first discuss the phenomenon of reproductive division of labour in social insects, particularly, the reproductive conflicts among females and the means by which these conflicts are resolved. I will then focus on the use of pheromones, a mode of communication that has broadly diversified among social insects that live in large complex societies. I will summarize the different approaches to define semiochemicals in the context of the reproductive division of labour and review the state of knowledge of compounds regulating insect reproduction, both solitary and social, demonstrating the structural diversity as well as the potential conservation of the mechanisms regulating signal production and perception. Lastly, I will discuss the different hypotheses underlying the evolution of pheromones regulating reproduction in insects. Our current understanding of reproductive signalling, while extensive within single species, is still limited by the paucity of comparative studies across the Insecta as a whole, and further investigations are sorely needed.},

Because BVOC-emission measurements are especially tedious, complex and extremely variable between species, two approaches have been used in scientific studies to try to estimate BVOC-emission types and rates from plant species. The first, which has known little success, involves grouping species according to plant-taxonomy criteria (typically, genus and family). The second involves studying the correlation between BVOC content and emission (i.e. how leaf content could be used to estimate emissions). The latter strategy has provided controversial results, partly because BVOCs are amazingly chemically diverse, and, as a result, techniques used to study plant BVOC content, which we review, cannot be equally adequate for all analytes. In order to choose an adequate technique, two patterns must be distinguished. Specifically stored compounds – mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes that dominate the essential oil obtained from a plant – are permanently and massively present in specific storage structures (e.g., secretory cavities, trichomes) of the order of μg/g–mg/g and usually allow emissions to occur during stress periods when terpenes are weakly synthesized. These BVOCs can be studied directly through traditional extraction techniques (e.g., hydrodistillation) and novel techniques (e.g., application of microwaves and ultrasound), and indirectly by trapping techniques involving the collection, within adsorbent material, of BVOCs present in the headspace of a plant. Non-specifically stored compounds (e.g., isoprene, 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol, and, in species without storage structures, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) can only be temporarily accumulated in leaf aqueous and lipid phases in small concentrations of the order of ng/g. As a result, studying their concentration in leaves requires the use of trapping techniques, more sensitive to trace amounts. Unlike for specifically stored BVOCs, knowledge of the concentration of non-specifically stored BVOCs cannot provide any information regarding the emission potential of a species but, instead, provides crucial information to understand why BVOC emissions may be uncoupled from the physiological processes that drive their synthesis. We describe both extracting and trapping techniques and discuss them in terms of the technical choices that may cause losses of thermolabile constituents, chemical transformations, different volatile recoveries and suitability to represent plant content of BVOCs faithfully. The second part of this review addresses technical shortcomings and biological and environmental factors that may alter the correlations between BVOC content and emission from plants.},

	abstract = {Dendrolimus punctatus Walker (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) is a pine caterpillar moth distributed in most areas of southern China and is an economically important pest of pine, due to its defoliation activity. Understanding fundamental sex pheromone perception mechanisms in D. punctatus may provide effective and sustainable options for novel control strategies. However, the identification and function of pheromone receptors, key genes that receipt the pheromone of this pest, are both unclear now. Previous researches suggested several candidate pheromone receptors whose expression levels were male antennae bias in D. punctatus. In this study, we cloned six candidate pheromone receptors (DpunOR 20/45/46/51/54/58) and Orco from D. punctatus. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that lepidopteran PRs tend to be conserved and clustered together; however, D. punctatus candidate PRs were located in a distinct clade. Motif analysis of PRs showed clear sequences differences between Dendrolimus spp. and other tested moth species. To illustrate the ligand response properties of the candidate PRs of D. punctatus, each of the six genes was expressed with an Orco gene in Xenopus oocytes and using two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings. Finally, we successfully identified two sex pheromone receptors (PR45 and PR46). Our study, which identified a novel lineage of PRs tuned to Type I pheromones in Lepidoptera, provides evidence for the new evolution origin of sex pheromone communication in moths, and lays a foundation for the development of novel control strategies of D. punctatus.},

To collect aerial volatiles induced by below-ground factors, cultivation of Picea seedlings on agar was combined with a newly developed volatile collection chamber to allow the separation of below-ground and aerial parts. The aim of this study was to investigate if below-ground root factors, such as mycorrhization or metal contaminated substrates are able to trigger a systemic volatile response of spruce seedlings. Cesium(I), a major contaminant in industrially polluted soils, was used to exert stress, and response was recorded in combination with ectomycorrhiza by the basidomycete Tricholoma vaccinum. The germination rate and growth show a toxic effect of cesium and a positive effect of the fungus on the roots and plant health. A pronounced volatile emission was observed in mycorrhizal seedlings treated with cesium. Without cesium treatment seedlings did not change their volatile emission depending on mycorrhization. However, if seedlings were treated with cesium, those with mycorrhiza emitted tricyclene, α- and β-pinene, camphene, myrcene, limonene, terpinolene, camphor and bornyl acetate. With the newly established volatile collection separated for above-ground and below-ground parts, abiotic and biotic factors can be evaluated with respect to chemodiversity and ecological interactions.},

	abstract = {Root (1973) observed fewer pests in weedy Brassica oleracea plantings, and suggested this could be because greater plant diversity bolstered resources for natural enemies and strengthened herbivore suppression (i.e., the Enemies Hypothesis) and/or disrupted host-location by specialist herbivores (i.e., the Resource Concentration Hypothesis). These proposed mechanisms have been exceptionally influential in efforts to manage agroecosystems to promote conservation biological control, yet their relative importance remains unclear. Because direct (plant-driven) and indirect (enemy-mediated) drivers of herbivore pressure are difficult to isolate experimentally, we compiled a multi-year observational dataset tracking arthropod pest and predator densities in B. oleracea plantings on over 50 farms varying in weed cover within fields as well as in habitat diversity in surrounding landscapes. We then used structural equation models to evaluate direct and indirect interaction links consistent with the Enemies and Resource Concentration Hypotheses, while also considering landscape context and enemy community structure. We predicted that non-crop habitat would limit herbivores indirectly by supporting evenly distributed communities of natural enemies. Our results revealed that weedy vegetation indeed benefitted predator evenness and thus indirectly correlated with enhanced predator densities, but instead of limiting herbivores, natural enemies seemed to track both aphids and caterpillars. Landscape diversity had no effect on predator evenness, yet appeared to benefit predator density, while having contrasting direct effects on aphids (positive) and caterpillars (negative). We found no evidence for direct negative links between weed cover and herbivores that would indicate an important role for the Resource Concentration Hypothesis. Instead, we found indirect links between weedy plants and natural enemy evenness across our network of field sites, suggesting partial support for the Enemies Hypothesis. More generally, we suggest that greater consideration of predator-predator interactions and local biodiversity effects could help explain inconsistent relationships between landscape diversity and herbivore suppression.},

	abstract = {Background: While virus-vector-host interactions have been a major focus of both basic and applied ecological research, little is known about how different levels of plant defense interact with prior herbivory to affect these relationships. We used genetically-modified strains of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) varying in the jasmonic acid (JA) plant defense pathways to explore how plant defense and prior herbivory affects a plant virus (tomato yellow leaf curl virus, 'TYLCV'), its vector (the whitefly Bemisia tabaci MED), and the host. Results: Virus-free MED preferred low-JA over high-JA plants and had lower fitness on high-JA plants. Viruliferous MED preferred low-JA plants but their survival was unaffected by JA levels. While virus-free MED did not lower plant JA levels, viruliferous MED decreased both JA levels and the expression of JA-related genes. Infestation by viruliferous MED reduced plant JA levels. In preference tests, neither virus-free nor viruliferous MED discriminated among JA-varying plants previously exposed to virus-free MED. However, both virus-free and viruliferous MED preferred low-JA plant genotypes when choosing between plants that had both been previously exposed to viruliferous MED. The enhanced preference for low-JA genotypes appears linked to the volatile compound neophytadiene, which was found only in whitefly-infested plants and at concentrations inversely related to plant JA levels. Conclusions: Our findings illustrate how plant defense can interact with prior herbivory to affect both a plant virus and its whitefly vector, and confirm the induction of neophytadiene by MED. The apparent attraction of MED to neophytadiene may prove useful in pest detection and management. © 2019 The Author(s).},

Global pollution trends, plant physiological responses and ecological perspectives in natural and agricultural systems are all discussed. In particular, we highlight the importance of studying sequential or simultaneous exposure of plants to pollutants, rather than exposure to individual pollutants in isolation, and explore how these responses may interfere with the way plants interact with their biotic community. Air pollutants can alter the normal physiology and metabolic functioning of plants. Here we describe how the phenotypic and molecular changes in response to multiple pollutants can differ compared to those elicited by single pollutants, and how different responses have been observed between plants in the field and in controlled laboratory conditions and between trees and crop plants. From an ecological perspective, we discuss how air pollution can result in greater susceptibility to biotic stressors and in direct or indirect effects on interactions with organisms that occupy higher trophic levels. Finally, we provide an overview of the potential uses of plants to mitigate air pollution, exploring the feasibility for pollution removal via the processes of bio-accumulation and phytoremediation. We conclude by proposing some new directions for future research in the field. © 2018 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands},

	abstract = {Above-ground plant tissues produce characteristic blends of volatile compounds in response to insect herbivory. These herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) function in plant defence and mediate foraging decisions by herbivores and their natural enemies. The ecological roles of HIPVs as foraging cues for different trophic levels highlight an important conflict for herbivores that need to locate suitable host plants while avoiding competition and predation. Plant roots also emit HIPVs following herbivory, but our understanding of root-produced volatiles and their ecological functions in soil environments remains limited. Moreover, recent studies have documented the effects of temporal dynamics of plant volatile production on ecological interactions, but little is known about how root HIPVs change throughout herbivory or the resulting ecological implications from such changes. In this study, we examined the roles of HIPVs from roots of cucumber plants Cucumis sativus as foraging cues for a specialist herbivore, striped cucumber beetle Acalymma vittatum and its natural enemies, entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs). We predicted HIPVs from A. vittatum-damaged roots would attract EPNs, while repelling conspecific larvae that avoid competition, induced plant defences and increased risk of predation by EPNs. To capture the temporal dynamics of root HIPVs, we determined how HIPV-mediated interactions change over time with sustained herbivory. Initially (after 24 hr), A. vittatum herbivory on C. sativus, or mechanical wounding, induced greater production of root volatiles. These root HIPVs recruited EPNs and repelled foraging A. vittatum larvae, although larval performance was not affected by prior damage. Sustained (7 days) herbivory by larvae reduced HIPVs to levels indistinguishable from undamaged control roots while mechanically damaged roots continued to produce higher levels of volatiles. Attenuation of HIPVs impaired indirect defence responses of C. sativus by reducing recruitment of EPNs and deterrence of A. vittatum larvae. These results suggest that root HIPVs function as honest signals that indicate the presence of herbivores, induction of indirect plant defences and increased risk of predation by natural enemies. However, some herbivores may overcome this line of plant defence by attenuating production of HIPVs and thus altering the outcomes of subsequent interactions among plants, herbivores and natural enemies.

	abstract = {Concentration of air pollutants, particularly ozone (O3), has dramatically increased since pre-industrial times in the troposphere. Due to the strong oxidative potential of O3, negative effects on both emission and lifetime in the atmosphere of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have already been highlighted. VOCs alteration by O3 may potentially affect the attraction of pollinators that rely on these chemical signals. Surprisingly, direct effects of O3 on the olfaction and the behavioral response of pollinators have not been investigated so far. We developed a comprehensive experiment under controlled conditions to assess O3 physiological and behavioral effects on two pollinator species, differing in their ecological traits. Using several realistic concentrations of O3 and various exposure times, we investigated the odor antennal detection and the attraction to VOCs present in the floral scents of their associated plants. Our results showed, in both species, a clear effect of exposure to high O3 concentrations on the ability to detect and react to the floral VOCs. These effects depend on the VOC tested and its concentration, and the O3 exposure (con-centration and duration) on the pollinator species. Pollination systems may, therefore, be impaired in different ways by increased levels of O3, the effects of which will likely depend on whether the exposure is chronic or, as in this study, punctual, likely causing some pollination systems to be more vulnerable than others. While several studies have already shown the negative impact of O3 on VOCs emission and lifetime in the atmosphere, this study reveals, for the first time, that this impact alters the pollinator detection and behavior. These findings highlight the urgent need to consider air pollution when evaluating threats to pollinators. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Prokaryotic expression of AcorOBP11 was conducted by Escherichia coli protein expression system, the OBP11 was inserted into the expression vector pET28a, and the recombinant plasmid was transferred into E. coli competent cells BL21 (DE3). The target protein was purified by using recombinant enterokinase to remove the His-tag and purified again by using a nickel column. The purified protein was diluted with 50 mmol·L-1 Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) to a dilution of 2 μmol·L-1, and the odorant was diluted with chromatographic grade methanol to a final concentration of 1 mmol·L-1, and 1-NPN was used as a fluorescent probe to determine the binding characteristics of AcorOBP11 to 37 host plant volatiles by fluorescence competitive binding assay. Modeller was used to obtain the three-dimensional structure of AcorOBP11 by using AgamOBP48 (PDB ID: 4ij7) as a template. Autodock semi-flexible docking was used to simulate the binding of AcorOBP11 to host plant volatiles.【Result】The full-length ORF of AcorOBP11 was amplified, which is 639 bp in total, including 17 amino acids of signal peptide at the N-terminal. With eight conserved cysteine sites, AcorOBP11 belongs to the Plus-C OBP subfamily. The evolutionary tree results indicated that it had the closest evolutionarily relationship with HparOBP9. AcorOBP11 was successfully inserted into pET-28a and expressed at 0.25 mmol·L-1 IPTG and induced expression at 37℃. The target protein was obtained by nickel column purification twice. The results of competitive binding experiments showed that AcorOBP11 has a good binding ability to 13 kinds of host plant volatiles, such as α-ionone, 3-methylbutanal, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, bornyl acetate, cinene, trans-2-hexenal, 2-ethylhexanal, isovaleric acid. Among them, α-ionone has the best binding ability, and its competitive dissociation constant is 22.78 μmol·L-1. The molecular docking results showed that AcorOBP11 has the lowest binding free energy with α-ionone, which is -24.74 kJ·mol-1, and forms a hydrogen bond at Cys163, indicating that it has the strongest binding ability with α-ionone, which is consistent with the fluorescence competition binding result. 【Conclusion】AcorOBP11 can recognize a variety of host plant volatiles, and it is speculated that it plays an important role in locating host plants for A. corpulenta. The results will provide new insights for A. corpulenta ecological control. © 2021 Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica. All rights reserved.},

Compared with the progress made in the field of insect olfaction, the understanding of how predatory mites perceive chemical compounds and react to their surroundings is merely fragmentarily documented in past decades. In this review, we provide a guide in the field from chemoecology of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) as early as 1980s to the advances made in comparative genomics of predatory mites in 2019. We present from three aspects, i.e., chemosensory-guided feeding behavior, sensory structures and chemoreceptors predicted from genomes. The molecular principles of chemosensory system remain exciting areas for future research, since insights into the mechanisms underlying the sensing of chemical signals will not only contribute to a better understanding of predator behavior and physiology but may also open new avenues for the development of more specific and sustainable approaches to control pests by manipulating behaviors in predators. We then suggest three directions for future research: 1) chemoreceptor gene identification and function verification; 2) neural response circuit to stimuli and 3) application of chemoperception on feeding behavior. The potential methods and techniques are provided as well. © 2021 Systematic and Applied Acarology Society. All rights reserved.},

These agro system manipulations could be based on chemical ecology studies considering the interactions with natural enemies and pests, regarding specifically plant defence signalling. Further, new crop protection strategies might rise from widening the knowledge regarding how herbivore-induced plant volatiles can govern a multifaceted defence response including natural enemy recruitment, pest repellence or induced defence in neighbouring plants. It is crucial to use a multitrophic approach to understand better the interactions involving companion plants, herbivores and natural enemies in the field, increasing the knowledge to build more efficient and sustainable pest management strategies. In this review, we explore the perspectives of companion plants and their semiochemicals to promote conservation biological control according to the ‘smart plants’ concept.

These sites present different environmental conditions. Leaf essential oils and volatiles were characterized by GC/MS after simultaneous distillation-extraction (SDE) and hydrodistillation (HD). All samples were rich in sesquiterpenes, mainly those from cadinene, germacrene and caryophyllene cyclization pathways, including (E)-caryophyllene, α-copaene, β-selinene, α-cadinene, selina-3,7 (11)-diene, germacrene B and caryophyllene oxide. Chemical profiles of N. obscura from different restingas presented high variation in the relative amount of some compounds. Fewer compounds were produced in a semi-arid climate (Massambaba restinga). Comparing samples collected during different seasons in Marambaia restinga, (E)-caryophyllene presented highly variable concentrations. The highest concentration was observed in August, which is the month of least rainfall. In contrast, germacrene B presented the lowest concentration in August. Leaf secretory structures were described using light and scanning microscopy and histochemical tests. The main sites of lipophilic and terpenoid accumulation are located in the secretory cavities of mesophyll. Our data indicate that the production of essential oils and volatiles in N. obscura is influenced by both plant developmental stage and environmental conditions.},

Second, the neuronal organization of the system is examined. Evidence of projection of the neuroreceptors from the 2 basal antennal segments (scape and pedicel) in the antennal mechanosensory and motor center and from the distal segments (flagellum) in the antennal lobe is discussed. Third, the types of cerebral neurons found in the antennal lobe are described. Fourth, all synaptic contacts between neurons in the antennal lobe take place in discrete glomeruli whose ultrastructure and neurotransmitters are examined. Evidence of individual identifiability of glomeruli is given. Fifth, various sexual dimorphisms present in the antenna and antennal lobe, related or not to sex pheromone perception, are described at sensillar, neuronal, and glomerular levels. Sixth, the postembryonic development of neurons and glomeruli is analyzed in holo- and hemimetabolous insects. In conclusion, the columnar organization of the system is emphasized, alternative models of antennal-neuron projection into glomeruli are considered, and the functional significance of identified glomeruli is discussed.},

Physiological functions are not restricted to one branch of the P450 evolutionary tree, and the ramifications that seem typical of “environmental response genes” are found in both microsomal and mitochondrial P450 encoding genes. The CYP3 and CYP4 clans seem the most diverse, and the smaller CYP2 and mitochondrial CYP clans seem to have proportionally more genes found as orthologs across species. There are many physiological functions for P450s that just are not known or suspected.

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter updates former reviews on locust polyphenism and also discusses recent findings. Over 200 articles were published in scientific journals on various aspects of locust phase polyphenism, markedly advancing the knowledge of the subject. However, the chapter refers to the older literature when background information is necessary for complementary and better treatment, or because of historical importance. Some of the recent publications report contradictory findings, and such contradictions have been emphasized in the chapter. Substantial progress has been made in the study of locust phase polyphenism over the past several years. The topic has well and truly emerged from the realms of applied entomology to assume a prominent position in the modern study of phenotypic plasticity, whereby adaptive phenotypes arise during development as a result of plastic interactions between genes and the environment. The study of behavioral gregarization has seen some of the most far-reaching progress. The involvement of locust-emitted volatiles in aspects of phase biology has generated substantial research and its fair share of productive controversy. It has been especially heartening to see that some of the major areas of controversy, such as the role of phenylacetonitrile, appear to have been at least partially resolved during the past year. New genetic resources also offer a solution to a more prosaic problem in locust research. There has been a growing realization that some of the differences reported between laboratories in aspects of phase polyphenism most likely reflect effects of rearing locusts in long-term culture in the laboratory.},

	abstract = {Climate change impacts animal abundances, distributions, and behaviors, frequently at the detriment to individuals. However, for many animals, including butterflies, current research focuses primarily on estimating abundance and distribution without observing behavior. Because behaviors often respond to climate change before other metrics, understanding behavioral change is critical for future climate change research and projections. Therefore, we investigated weather related changes in adult butterfly behavior using snapshot behavioral observations taken as part of a four year study of butterfly abundance throughout North Dakota, USA. Across 1,107 site-visits, we categorized adult butterfly behavior using 146,610 observations while also recording local weather variables with each site visit. We found patterns in butterfly behavior within years, including more flying and less resting at sites that were warmer during that site visit. We also observed differences across years, including more flying overall and a weaker behavioral response to temperature in a year that was particularly cool and wet. Further incorporating such behavioral observations into abundance surveys can help lead to better insights about weather-related variation in behavioral patterns and their consequences for animals facing climate change.},

Sampling methods that collect insects from quadrats or habitat units can provide estimates of density, whereas interception traps provide only relative measures of abundance.

The four species exhibit different oviposition strategies in the fig ovules where their offspring hatch and develop. Antennal sensilla morphology was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. Females of the four species present 11 morphologically similar types of sensilla: trichoid sensilla, sensilla obscura, chaetica sensilla 1 and 2, which all have mechanosensory functions; uniporous basiconic sensilla, which are presumably contact chemosensilla; basiconic capitate peg sensilla, coeloconic sensilla 1, multiporous basiconic and placoid sensilla, which may be regarded as olfactory sensilla, and coeloconic sensilla 2 and 3, which are presumed to be proprioreceptors or pressure receptors. The four species have significant differences in the abundance and arrangement of trichoid sensilla and chaetica sensilla 1 on the flagellum. The coeloconic sensilla and sensilla obscura only occur on the antennae of C. emarginatus that enter figs. The chemosensilla which are presumably involved in host discrimination, i.e., basiconic sensilla, multiporous placoid sensilla and basiconic capitate peg sensilla, are similar in shape and configuration, although they present some differences in abundance. These findings provide practical information on the adaptations of fig wasps and the relationship between multisensory antennae and functions in fig wasp behaviour.},

	abstract = {Fall armyworm (FAW), a voracious agricultural pest native to North and South America, was first detected on the African continent in 2016 and has subsequently spread throughout the continent and across Asia. It has been predicted that FAW could cause up to \$US13 billion per annum in crop losses throughout sub-Saharan Africa, thereby threatening the livelihoods of millions of poor farmers. In their haste to respond to FAW governments may promote indiscriminate use of chemical pesticides which, aside from human health and environmental risks, could undermine smallholder pest management strategies that depend to a large degree on natural enemies. Agro-ecological approaches offer culturally appropriate low-cost pest control strategies that can be readily integrated into existing efforts to improve smallholder incomes and resilience through sustainable intensification. Such approaches should therefore be promoted as a core component of integrated pest management (IPM) programmes for FAW in combination with crop breeding for pest resistance, classical biological control and selective use of safe pesticides. Nonetheless, the suitability of agro-ecological measures for reducing FAW densities and impact need to be carefully assessed across varied environmental and socio-economic conditions before they can be proposed for wide-scale implementation. To support this process, we review evidence for the efficacy of potential agro-ecological measures for controlling FAW and other pests, consider the associated risks, and draw attention to critical knowledge gaps. The evidence indicates that several measures can be adopted immediately. These include (i) sustainable soil fertility management, especially measures that maintain or restore soil organic carbon; (ii) intercropping with appropriately selected companion plants; and (iii) diversifying the farm environment through management of (semi)natural habitats at multiple spatial scales. Nevertheless, we recommend embedding trials into upscaling programmes so that the costs and benefits of these interventions may be determined across the diverse biophysical and socio-economic contexts that are found in the invaded range.},

Effects of feeding punctures produced by Liriomyza huidobrensis (pea leafminers) adult females on the plant's dominant monoterpenes, pulegone and menthone were assessed by monitoring essential oil composition at 24, 48, and 120h; emission of volatiles was also measured 24 and 48h after wounding. We studied such changes in Minthostachys mollis, a Lamiaceae species native to Central Argentina with medicinal and aromatic uses. Leaf puncturing resulted in reduced menthone throughout the experiment and increased pulegone concentration in M. mollis essential oil during the first 48h. The adjacent undamaged leaves showed similar changes, suggesting a systemic response. Composition of volatiles released from damaged leaves was also altered, most noticeably by increasing pulegone and diminishing menthone emissions. Such herbivore-induced chemical changes in aromatic plants are economically relevant, since the quality of essential oils and volatile emissions are altered.},

Microorganisms are ubiquitous in nature and successfully colonize diverse natural environments. Secondary metabolites production is testimonial to enormous biosynthetic capabilities of microorganisms and can be a potential partner in modulating local and systemic defense mechanisms in plants under adverse external conditions. Inoculating plants with root-colonizing nonpathogenic bacteria can significantly increase tolerance against abiotic stresses such as salinity, drought, metallic toxicity, and bioprotection against biotic stresses apart from acting as biocontrol agents. Increasing climatic alterations, crop losses, and environmentally unfriendly chemical pesticides made it imperative to explore the underlying integrated processes of plant-microbe interactions. Multiomics approaches including transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and genomics are providing the deeper insights into the microbial-mediated stress tolerance in plants and are inevitable to understand for implementation in the fields. This chapter highlights the significance of plant growth–promoting bacteria as the effective tools for environmentally friendly resource management to improve crop production for sustainable agriculture. Beneficial bacteria-mediated stress management in plants comprises several biochemical, physiological, and morphological mechanisms, and understanding of these cross-protection microorganisms is highly valuable in agriculture systems under the stress of climatic change.},

Fragrance chemistry was species-specific during nocturnal emissions, whereas odors emitted diurnally were less distinct. All species emitted greater amounts of fragrance at night, regardless of pollinator affinity. However, these species differed markedly in odor complexity and emission rates, even among close relatives. Species-specific differences in emission rates per flower and per unit fresh or dry flower mass were significantly correlated; fragrance differences between species were not greatly affected by different forms of standardization. Flowers of hawkmoth-pollinated species emitted nitrogenous aldoximes and benzenoid esters on nocturnal rhythms. Four Nicotiana species in section Alatae sensu strictu have flowers that emit large amounts of 1,8 cineole, with smaller amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons and α-terpineol on a nocturnal rhythm. This pattern suggests the activity of a single biosynthetic enzyme (1,8 cineole synthase) with major and minor products; however, several terpene synthase enzymes could contribute to total monoterpene emissions. Our analyses, combined with other studies of tobacco volatiles, suggest that phenotypic fragrance variation in Nicotiana is shaped by pollinator- and herbivore-mediated selection, biosynthetic pathway dynamics and shared evolutionary history.},

These changes could profoundly affect the status of insect pests, diseases, weeds and nematode of crops. These may arise not only as a result of direct effects on the distribution and abundance of pest populations, but also as a result of indirect effects on the pests’ host plants, competitors and natural enemies. Some pests which are already present but only occur in small areas or at low densities may be able to exploit the changing conditions by spreading more widely and reaching damaging population densities. Changes in climatic parameters in terms of increased temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide may result in changes in geographical distribution, increased over-wintering, changes in population growth rates, increases in the number of generations, extension of the development season, changes in crop pest synchrony of phenology, changes in interspecific interactions and increased risk of invasion by migrant pests. A number of priorities for future research into the effects of climatic changes on agricultural pests are suggested with the case examples.},

Yet the impact of natural enemies in CBC is often limited due to missing resources such as food, habitat, and hibernation shelters. Here, we studied a CBC strategy that incorporates these essential resources combined with semiochemicals, focusing on how the common green lacewing can enhance biological control of aphids. In a 4-year field study conducted at three locations in the region of East Norway, we developed a CBC strategy combining the three measures ATTRACT (a ternary attractant that increase lacewing egg laying), FOOD (floral buffer strips), and SHELTER (insect hotels for overwintering survival) to increase aphid biological control in spring barley. We recorded the number of lacewings, ladybirds, hoverflies, parasitized aphid mummies, and the two cereal aphid species Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi. Our CBC strategy resulted in a significant increase in lacewing activity and significant aphid suppression. At all three locations and over the 4-year period, aphid infestation was below the economic damage threshold in the field plots using CBC measures. In contrast, during two of the years, the density of the aphid infestation in the control plots was significantly above the damage threshold. We found evidence that use of the ternary attractant supported green lacewings but led to loss of ladybirds, hoverflies, and parasitoids, even though flower strips were used as alternative resources. Our study shows a promising increase in lacewing activity in the agricultural landscape and high biological control of aphids in barley. Long-term field studies are needed to evaluate the impact on non-target species and the agroecosystem before practical application of this approach can be considered.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter reviews the existing data on numbers of chemoreceptors on the legs, mouthparts, and antennae of insects and describes the physiological characteristics of the sensilla. It discusses the possible significance of numbers of sensilla in relation to insect behavior and evolution. The picture that emerges is fragmentary, but the fragments should serve to indicate fruitful lines of research, which will lead to a better understanding of the physiological significance of chemoreceptor populations and the numerical differences that occur between them. It is apparent that observed behavior will often be the outcome of interactions between several, even many, chemosensory inputs. It is not, therefore, to be expected that the input from a single receptor will be directly related to behavior except in very simple situations. This may be true even where a receptor is tuned to a key stimulus. For example, bark beetles have very few olfactory sensilla compared with many moths and, as a consequence, they are probably less sensitive to their attractant pheromone. However, bark beetle pheromones are produced at host trees that have a characteristic odor. This is also attractant to the beetles and occurs in much greater concentrations than the pheromone so that attraction from a distance can occur without a very sensitive sensory system.},

	abstract = {Phytophagous mites are serious pests in indoor and outdoor agricultural ecosystems and are controlled by synthetic pesticides. Pesticides adversely affect natural enemies and lead to environmental pollution, human health problems, harmful side effects, and risk of pest resistance. Currently, demand for organic and pesticide-free crops is rising in both developed and developing countries because of increasing public awareness of the direct and indirect effects of pesticides, food-borne diseases, and food security. In recent decades, the focus on crop production has moved from yield to quality, safety, and sustainability. To achieve this goal, the concept of integrated pest management strategies based on biocontrol agents has gained importance. Mite predators are important in integrated management of mites, particularly in complex crop systems where they may remove the need for any chemical intervention. Several kinds of mite predators occur in nature that can regulate mite populations. The fundamentals of a biocontrol program are to precisely recognize the pest and to find efficient predators using their life table parameters, foraging behavior, and trophic interactions. Using mite predators is often commercial because of the need of mass production and their large-scale releases to control phytophagous mites. Two important challenges in commercial biocontrol strategies are problems associated with marketing include benefit to cost ratio, limited number of retailers, producers unable to offer production, and problems associated with market demand affected by different issues such as public opinion, exaggeration of the results of biocontrol programs, and growers' knowledge. Governments and international organizations have important roles in marketing biocontrol agents by making strict rules benefitting biocontrol programs. To achieve this goal and to approach safety and security in crop production, biocontrol practices should be globally encouraged. Based on the high demand for safe food, a future high demand for using biocontrol agents is predicted. Therefore, more research and activity on different aspects of biocontrol as an ecofriendly practice is inevitable.},

Increased plant growth, reduced herbivory and altered insect feeding pattern were observed after maize inoculation with T. atroviride. Plant protection was correlated with increased emission of volatile terpenes and accumulation of jasmonic acid, an activator of defense responses against herbivory. Chemical analyses revealed that T. atroviride produced the volatiles 1-octen-3-ol and 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one. Pharmacological tests showed that both compounds reduced the consumption of foliar tissue and altered the feeding pattern of S. frugiperda in a similar way to T. atroviride. These results provide new insight into the role of T. atroviride in plant health in terms of induction of resistance to insect herbivory and production of antifeedant secondary metabolites.},

	abstract = {Survival of every organism on earth depends on its interactions with other organisms. For example, animals form associations with the intestinal microflora, while plants develop symbiotic associations with neighboring plants, microflora, and microfauna. Most of the associations between plants and microorganisms are mediated by organic compounds released by the plant. The plant root system acts as a factory and exudes enormous amount of chemicals to effectively communicate with the surrounding soil organisms. Bacteria on roots and in the rhizosphere can also utilize these organic compounds as a source of nutrients and enhance their population size and metabolic activities. In return, plant-associated bacteria improve plant growth and development by different mechanisms including nitrogen fixation, provision of nutrients, and mediating resistance against pathogens. Although plant–bacterial partnerships have been found effective to enhance biomass production, their importance and relevance in agricultural systems are still underestimated. A better understanding of beneficial interactions between plant, soil, and bacteria could be exploited to improve growth and health of food and feed crops. Plant growth-promoting mechanisms of bacteria might enhance biomass production in a more sustainable manner, even on marginal land. Furthermore, plant growth-promoting and/or pollutant-degrading activities of bacteria could be exploited to improve the efficiency of phytoremediation of organic and inorganic pollutants from the soil and water or to protect the food chain by decreasing the concentrations of pollutants in food crops.},

	abstract = {The EU ban on in-feed antibiotics has stimulated research on weaning diets as a way of reducing post-weaning gut disorders and growth check in pigs. Many bioactive components have been investigated but only few have shown to be effective. Amongst these, organic acids (OA) have been shown to exert a bactericidal action mediated by non-dissociated OA, by lowering gastric pH, increasing gut and pancreas enzyme secretion and improving gut wall morphology. It has been postulated that they may also enhance non-specific immune responses and improve disease resistance. In contrast, relatively little attention has been paid to the impact of OA on the stomach but recent data show they can differently affect gastric histology, acid secretion and gastric emptying. Butyrate and precursors of butyric acid have received special attention and although promising results have been obtained, their effects are dependent upon the dose, treatment duration, initial age of piglets, gastrointestinal site and other factors. The amino acids (AA) like glutamine, tryptophan and arginine are supportive in improving digestion, absorption and retention of nutrients by affecting tissue anabolism, stress and (or) immunity. Glutamine, cysteine and threonine are important for maintaining mucin and permeability of intestinal barrier function. Spray-dried plasma (SDP) positively affects gut morphology, inflammation and reduces acquired specific immune responses via specific and a-specific influences of immunoglobulins and other bioactive components. Effects are more pronounced in early-weaned piglets and under poorer health conditions. Little interaction between plasma protein and antibiotics has been found, suggesting distinct modes of action and additive effects. Bovine colostrum may act more or less similarly to SDP. The composition of essential oils is highly variable, depending on environmental and climatic conditions and distillation methods. These oils differ widely in their antimicrobial activity in vitro and some components of weaning diets may decrease their activity. Results in young pigs are highly variable depending upon the product and doses used. These studies suggest that relatively high concentrations of essential oils are needed for beneficial effects to be observed and it has been assumed that these plant extracts mimic most of the effects of antibiotics active on gut physiology, microbiology and immunology. Often, bioactive substances protective to the gut also stimulate feed intake and growth performance. New insights on the effects of selected OA and AA, protein sources (especially SDP, bovine colostrum) and plant extracts with anti-bacterial activities on the gut are reported in this review.},

Some examples of tachinid and other dipteran parasitoids implicated in biological control are presented in the first section. Subsequently, the most important aspects of their biology relevant for rearing are described. In vivo and in vitro rearing techniques are considered in another section from different points of view, such as host type (natural vs alternative) and age, infestation mode, abiotic conditions, parasitoid nutritional needs, and continuous in vitro culture. Adult maintenance, quality control, and storage and shipment procedures are also discussed. Finally, some perspectives are presented with the aim of stimulating new ideas for research efforts on the mass culturing of dipteran parasitoids.},

Insects, like other animals, must acquire their energy and material resources from other organisms, living or dead. As a group, insects exploit a wide range of resources, including plant, animal, and detrital material, but individual organisms must find and acquire more specific resources that often do not provide required nutrients in proper balances or are physically or chemically defended. Therefore insects must be adapted physiologically and behaviorally to find suitable resources that vary widely in nutritional value, acceptability, and availability, depending on environmental conditions. Adaptations by individual species represent trade-offs among alternative strategies, thereby restricting the range of resources that can be exploited.},

	abstract = {Jasmonic acid and Methyl Jasmonate (MeJA) are important signaling molecules for plant defensive responses upon mechanical wounding, herbivory damage, or fungal inoculation. There is an increased interest in the use of exogenous chemical elicitors such as jasmonic acids to induce natural host defense mechanisms as an alternative to synthetic chemical pesticides. However few studies have compared the response caused by application of elicitors vs. real herbivores and few studies have analyzed the impact on particular pest species of plant responses induced by exogenous application of MeJA. We compared the defensive response of two pine species, one native to our study area (Pinus pinaster) and one introduced (Pinus radiata), after exogenous application of MeJA and after feeding of a regionally important indigenous pest (pine processionary moth, PPM). We analyzed variation in foliar terpenes, nitrogen and water. Additionally we assessed the consequences of plant responses to MeJA for the growth and mortality of PPM larvae. Because the defensive reaction may be influenced by resource availability, we also evaluated effects of site quality on plant responsiveness to MeJA and insect feeding. The exogenous application of MeJa had different effects in the two pine species. In P. radiata, there were no conspicuous increases from MeJA in any measured terpene, and on good sites, there were general decreases in overall concentrations of the three terpene classes. In P. pinaster, MeJA by itself had no detectable effect on overall concentrations of any class of terpenes, but there was a 6-fold increase in the concentration of one monoterpene, linalool. Feeding by PPM induced decreases in terpenes, especially monoterpenes, in both species. Foliar nitrogen contents were markedly higher in P. radiata than P. pinaster – especially on good sites. Foliar water content was similar between pine species and, in both species, was reduced relative to control trees in treatments that included PPM feeding. There were no differences in larval mortality between trees that were and were not exposed to exogenous MeJA. In summary, the exogenous application of MeJA had effects on the terpene chemistry of both pine species, but the effects were less consistent across species and compounds than expected under some models of MeJA biochemistry. It seems likely that operational manipulations of MeJA to manage pests in pine forestry will require further understanding of differences among pine species in their responses to MeJA.},

Plants’ tolerance to drought stress needs to be improved in order to allow growth of crops that satisfy food demands under limited water resource availability. Plant-associated microbial communities, such as mycorrhizal fungi, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), enhance crop productivity and provide stress resistance. PGPR represent a wide range of root-colonizing bacteria with excellent root colonizing ability and capacity to produce a wide range of enzymes and metabolites that help plants tolerate both biotic and abiotic stresses. Their roles in the management of abiotic stresses such as drought are only beginning to gain attention. In this review, we synthesize research concerning bacterial-mediated drought tolerance in agricultural crop plants. We summarize in a table and provide details of most relevant and recent studies about the crop system studied, experimental system, means of applying drought stress, and physiological traits measured (such as relative water content, photosynthesis). Furthermore, we highlight the research needed to understand mechanisms behind observed bacterial-mediated drought tolerance and the need to homogenize and develop screening protocols.},

The precise route of virus movement through the vector can differ across and within virus families, but these viruses all share many biological, biochemical, and ecological features. All share temporal and spatial constraints with respect to transmission efficiency. The viruses also induce physiological changes in their plant hosts resulting in behavioral changes in the insects that optimize the transmission of virus to new hosts. Virus proteins interact with insect, endosymbiont, and plant proteins to orchestrate, directly and indirectly, virus movement in insects and plants to facilitate transmission. Knowledge of these complex interactions allows for the development of new tools to reduce or prevent transmission, to quickly identify important vector populations, and to improve the management of these economically important viruses affecting agricultural and natural plant populations.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity enables organisms to survive in the face of unpredictable environmental stress. Intimately related to the notion of phenotypic plasticity is the concept of the reaction norm that places phenotypic plasticity in the context of a genotype-specific response to environmental gradients. Whether reaction norms themselves evolve and which factors might affect their shape has been the object of intense debates among evolutionary biologists along the years. Since their discovery, viruses have been considered as pathogens. However, new viromic techniques and a shift in conceptual paradigms are showing that viruses are mostly non-pathogenic ubiquitous entities. Recent studies have shown how viral infections can even be beneficial for their hosts. This may happen especially in the context of stressed hosts, where the virus infection can induce beneficial changes in the host's physiological homeostasis, hence changing the shape of the reaction norm. Despite the fact that underlying physiological mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics are still not well understood, such beneficial interactions are being discovered in a growing number of plant-virus systems. Here, we aim to review these disperse studies and place them into the context of phenotypic plasticity and the evolution of reaction norms. This is an emerging field that is posing many questions that still need to be properly answered. The answers would clearly interest virologists, plant pathologists and evolutionary biologists and likely they will suggest possible future biotechnological applications, including the development of crops with higher survival rates and yield under adverse environmental situations.},

This chapter discusses the insect CYP genes and P450 enzymes. Cytochrome P450, or CYP genes, constitutes one of the largest family of genes, with representatives in virtually all living organisms, from bacteria to protists, plants, fungi, and animals. The multiple functions of insect P450 enzymes, their complex biochemistry, and their toxicological and physiological importance are presented. Physiological functions are not restricted to one branch of the P450 evolutionary tree, and the ramifications that seem typical of “environmental response genes” are found in both microsomal and mitochondrial P450 encoding genes. The CYP3 and CYP4 clans seem the most diverse, and the smaller CYP2 and mitochondrial CYP clans seem to have proportionally more genes found as orthologs across species. There are many physiological functions for P450s that just are not known or suspected. CYP4C7 was shown to be selectively expressed in the corpora allata and to metabolize JH and its precursors to new metabolites.},

This chapter discusses the genetics and physiology of the Drosophila olfactory system. All the information the fly needs for encoding quality, intensity, and temporal variations of odors is present in the firing patterns of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In Drosophila, quality, intensity, and temporal variations of odors are encoded in the activity across a limited number of ORN classes (n ≈ 40) and are time dependent. Information about odors is concentrated in a small subset of ORN classes. The Drosophila olfactory system studies are useful in obtaining complete wiring maps for the processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli. The processing in olfactory glomeruli provides fine tuning, integration with information on air condition, extraction of temporal patterns, and calibration to the internal state of the animal. Partly overlapping areas of projection in the lateral horn (LH) allow extraction of a specific combinatorial code that mediates innate behavioral responses to odors. The development of molecular genetic techniques for the expression of functional probes, such as calcium-sensitive proteins, has helped in increasing the understanding of the coding properties of specific neurons.},

Behavior genetics is the study of the underlying hereditary basis of behavior. For many years, Mendelian genetic analyses were conducted on a few traits determined by one or a few genes, or quantitative genetic methods were used for the traits determined by “many” genes. The Drosophila Genome Project and the use of molecular genetic methods are revolutionizing the analysis of the genetic basis of insect behavior. Circadian behaviors, mating behavior, and learning in Drosophila have been dissected with the tools of molecular genetics, and inter- and intraspecific comparisons can be made of the DNA sequences associated with these behaviors. The circadian clock of Drosophila involves several genes, including period + ( per +). Mutants of period influence activity patterns and other circadian rhythms, as well as altering song cycles in courting males. Drosophila learning mutants, such as dunce and couch potato, are providing insights into the fundamental processes involved in short-term, intermediate, long-term, and anesthetic resistant learning in insects and other organisms. Analyses of behaviors that are determined by many genes are being revolutionized by the use of molecular genetic methods and the Drosophila Genome Project. It now is possible to map the number and location of genes affecting complex traits by correlating their inheritance with a variety of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) markers and by conducting gene chip analyses.},

	abstract = {The negative cross-talk between induced plant defences against pathogens and arthropod herbivores is exploited by vectors of plant pathogens: a plant challenged by pathogens reduces investment in defences that would otherwise be elicited by herbivores. This negative cross-talk may also be exploited by non-vector herbivores which elicit similar anti-herbivore defences in the plant. We studied how damage by the thrips Frankliniella occidentalis and/or infection with Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) affect the performance of a non-vector arthropod: the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae, a parenchym feeder just like F. occidentalis. Juvenile survival of spider mites on plants inoculated with TSWV by thrips was higher than on control and on thrips-damaged plants. However, thrips damage did not reduce spider-mite survival as compared to the control, suggesting that the positive effect of TSWV on spider-mite survival is independent of anti-thrips defence. Developmental and oviposition rates were enhanced on plants inoculated with TSWV by thrips and on plants with thrips damage. Therefore, spider mites benefit from TSWV-infection of pepper plants, but also from the response of plants to thrips damage. We suggest that the positive effects of TSWV on this non-vector species cannot be explained exclusively by cross-talk between anti-herbivore and anti-pathogen plant defences.
Zusammenfassung
Die negative gegenseitige Beeinflussung der induzierten Pflanzenabwehr gegen Pathogene und herbivore Arthropoden wird von Vektoren von Pflanzenpathogenen ausgenutzt: eine Pflanze, die von Pathogenen angegriffen wird, reduziert ihre Investition in Abwehrmechanismen, die ansonsten von den Herbivoren ausgelöst würden. Diese negative gegenseitige Beeinflussung kann ebenso von Herbivoren ausgenutzt werden, die keine Vektoren sind und die eine ähnliche Anti-Herbivoren-Reaktion der Pflanze auslösen. Wir untersuchten, wie eine Beschädigung durch den Trips Frankliniella occidentalis und/oder die Infektion mit dem Tomatenbronzefleckenvirus (TSWV) die Performanz eines Nicht-Vektor-Arthropoden beeinflusst, der Spinnenmilbe Tetranychus urticae, die genau wie F. occidentalis ein Parenchymfresser ist. Die Überlebensrate der juvenilen Spinnmilben war auf den Pflanzen höher, die durch den Trips mit TSWV inokuliert waren, im Unterschied zu den Kontroll- und den durch Tripse beschädigten Pflanzen. Die Beschädigung durch Tripse reduzierte die Überlebensrate der Spinnmilben jedoch im Vergleich zu den Kontrollen nicht und lässt vermuten, dass der positive Effekt des TSWV auf die Überlebensrate der Spinnmilben unabhängig von der Anti-Trips-Verteidigung ist. Die Entwicklungsraten und die Eiablageraten waren auf den Pflanzen verbessert, die durch Tripse mit TSWV inokuliert oder von Tripsen beschädigt waren. Deshalb profitieren die Spinnmilben von einer TSWV-Infektion auf Paprikapflanzen aber auch von der Antwort der Pflanzen auf eine Beschädigung durch Tripse. Wir vermuten daher, dass der positive Effekt von TSWV auf diese Nicht-Vektor-Art nicht ausschließlich durch die gegenseitige Beeinflussung der Pflanzenabwehr gegen Herbivore und Pathogene erklärt werden kann.},

	abstract = {Benzenoid carboxyl methyltransferases synthesize methyl esters (e.g., methyl benzoate and methyl salicylate), which are constituents of aromas and scents of many plant species and play important roles in plant communication with the surrounding environment. Within the past five years, eleven such carboxyl methyltransferases were isolated and most of them were comprehensively investigated at the biochemical, molecular and structural level. Two types of enzymes can be distinguished according to their substrate preferences: the SAMT-type enzymes isolated from Clarkia breweri, Stephanotis floribunda, Antirrhinum majus, Hoya carnosa, and Petunia hybrida, which have a higher catalytic efficiency and preference for salicylic acid, while BAMT-type enzymes from A. majus, Arabidopsis thaliana, Arabidopsis lyrata, and Nicotiana suaveolens prefer benzoic acid. The elucidation of C. breweri SAMT’s three-dimensional structure allowed a detailed modelling of the active sites of the carboxyl methyltransferases and revealed that the SAM binding pocket is highly conserved among these enzymes while the methyl acceptor binding site exhibits some variability, allowing a classification into SAMT-type and BAMT-type enzymes. The analysis of expression patterns coupled with biochemical characterization showed that these carboxyl methyltransferases are involved either in floral scent biosynthesis or in plant defense responses. While the latter can be induced by biotic or abiotic stress, the genes responsible for floral scent synthesis exhibit developmental and rhythmic expression pattern. The nature of the product and efficiency of its formation in planta depend on the availability of substrates, the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme toward benzoic acid and/or salicylic acid, and the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulation at the enzyme level. The biochemical properties of benzenoid carboxyl methyltransferases suggest that the genes involved in plant defenses might represent the ancestor for the presently existing floral genes which during evolution gained different expression profiles and encoded enzymes with the ability to accept structurally similar substrates.},

This chapter provides general appreciation for some of the exciting research at several different levels in the field of terpene and isoprenoid metabolism in plants. The structural variety of terpenes is elaborated by subsequent modifications to the cyclic scaffolds or backbones by hydroxylations, methylations, demethylations, halogenations, oxidations, and possibly even glycosylations. Biologists use the tools of molecular genetics to define the contribution of isoprenoids to the ability of plants to interact with their environment. The chapter discusses that molecular biologists and geneticists are determining mechanisms regulating the expression of this biosynthetic machinery, and biochemists are elucidating structure–function relationships for key enzymes in the pathway. Bringing this array of information back together and using it for the creation of novel terpenes having unique biological roles is clearly one of the next great challenges in the field. This includes the development of designer enzymes, the coupling of enzymes in novel ways (physically and biochemically), and expressing de novo isoprenoid pathways in transgenic microbes and plants.},

	abstract = {Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS) is an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of prenyl precursors for the production of primary and secondary metabolites, including sterols, dolichols, carotenoids and ubiquinones, and for the modification of proteins. Here we identified and characterized two FPSs (EuFPS1 and EuFPS2) from the plant Eucommia ulmoides. The EuFPSs had seven highly conserved prenyltransferase-specific domains that are critical for activity. Complementation and biochemical analyses using bacterially produced recombinant EuFPS isoforms showed that the EuFPSs had FPP synthesis activities both in vivo and in vitro. In addition to the typical reaction mechanisms of FPS, EuFPSs utilized farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as an allylic substrate and participated in further elongation of the isoprenyl chain, resulting in the synthesis of geranylgeranyl diphosphate. However, despite the high amino acid similarities between the two EuFPS isozymes, their specific activities, substrate preferences, and final reaction products were different. The use of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) as an allylic substrate highlighted the differences between the two enzymes: depending on the pH, the metal ion cofactor, and the cofactor concentration, EuFPS2 accumulated geranyl diphosphate as an intermediate product at a constant rate, whereas EuFPS1 synthesized little geranyl diphosphate. The reaction kinetics of the EuFPSs demonstrated that isopentenyl diphosphate and DMAPP were used both as substrates and as inhibitors of EuFPS activity. Taken together, the results indicate that the biosynthesis of FPP is highly regulated by various factors indispensable for EuFPS reactions in plants.},

As insect olfactory neurobiology takes advantage of a variety of species separated by millions of years of evolution, the field naturally has yielded some conflicting results. Far from impeding progress, the varieties of insect olfactory systems reflect the various natural histories, adaptations to specific environments, and the roles olfaction plays in the life of the species studied. We review current findings in insect olfactory neurobiology, with special attention to differences among species. We begin by describing the olfactory environments and olfactory-based behaviors of insects, as these form the context in which neurobiological findings are interpreted. Next, we review recent work describing changes in olfactory systems as adaptations to new environments or behaviors promoting speciation. We proceed to discuss variations on the basic anatomy of the antennal (olfactory) lobe of the brain and higher-order olfactory centers. Finally, we describe features of olfactory information processing including gain control, transformation between input and output by operations such as broadening and sharpening of tuning curves, the role of spiking synchrony in the antennal lobe, and the encoding of temporal features of encounters with an odor plume. In each section, we draw connections between particular features of the olfactory neurobiology of a species and the animal's life history. We propose that this perspective is beneficial for insect olfactory neurobiology in particular and sensory neurobiology in general.},

The enzymatic bioconversion capacities of two plant species were tested towards dehydroabietic acid. Dehydroabietic acid (DHA) is an abundant resin acid in conifers, representing a natural wood protectant. It is also one of the constituents found in by-products of the kraft chemical pulping industry. DHA was fed to tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) plant cell and tissue cultures and bioconversion product formation was monitored using NMR analysis. Both plant species took up DHA from culture medium, and various types of typical detoxification processes occurred in both cultures. In addition, diverse responses to DHA treatment were observed, including differences in uptake kinetics, chemical modification of added substrate and changes in overall metabolism of the cells. Interestingly, Catharanthus roseus, a host species for pharmaceutically valuable terpenoid indole alkaloids, exhibited a very different bioconversion pattern for exogenously applied DHA than tobacco, which does not possess a terpenoid indole pathway. In tobacco, DHA is readily glycosylated in the carbonyl group, whereas in periwinkle it is proposed that a cytochrome P450-catalyzed enzymatic detoxification reaction takes place before the formation of glycosylated product.},

In addition, CO2 elevation from 450 to 1200 improved the production of phenols (including anthocyanins, flavonoids and phenolics), while increasing CO2 from 1200 to 2000 appeared to negate such promotion.

	abstract = {Rapid changes of the biosphere observed in recent years are caused by both small and large scale drivers, like shifts in temperature, transformations in land-use, or changes in the energy budget of systems. While the latter processes are easily quantifiable, documentation of the loss of biodiversity and community structure is more difficult. Changes in organismal abundance and diversity are barely documented. Censuses of species are usually fragmentary and inferred by often spatially, temporally and ecologically unsatisfactory simple species lists for individual study sites. Thus, detrimental global processes and their drivers often remain unrevealed. A major impediment to monitoring species diversity is the lack of human taxonomic expertise that is implicitly required for large-scale and fine-grained assessments. Another is the large amount of personnel and associated costs needed to cover large scales, or the inaccessibility of remote but nonetheless affected areas. To overcome these limitations we propose a network of Automated Multisensor stations for Monitoring of species Diversity (AMMODs) to pave the way for a new generation of biodiversity assessment centers. This network combines cutting-edge technologies with biodiversity informatics and expert systems that conserve expert knowledge. Each AMMOD station combines autonomous samplers for insects, pollen and spores, audio recorders for vocalizing animals, sensors for volatile organic compounds emitted by plants (pVOCs) and camera traps for mammals and small invertebrates. AMMODs are largely self-containing and have the ability to pre-process data (e.g. for noise filtering) prior to transmission to receiver stations for storage, integration and analyses. Installation on sites that are difficult to access require a sophisticated and challenging system design with optimum balance between power requirements, bandwidth for data transmission, required service, and operation under all environmental conditions for years. An important prerequisite for automated species identification are databases of DNA barcodes, animal sounds, for pVOCs, and images used as training data for automated species identification. AMMOD stations thus become a key component to advance the field of biodiversity monitoring for research and policy by delivering biodiversity data at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.},

Biological control, including pathogens, predators and parasitoids, helps to suppress many of these pests, but by itself, often fails to control pest economic damage to the crop. Knowledge of natural enemy habits, requirements, and efficacy is surprisingly incomplete. More effective biological control would reduce pesticide use with its associated risks of pesticide resistance, and to human health and the environment. Behavioral control, the use of semiochemicals including pheromones to suppress pests, is also promising, and we review its potential for these pests.

	abstract = {Pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs) play an important role in the recognition of pheromones by insects. However, the abilities of these PBPs to discriminate pheromone components and recognize the isomers are unclear. Dendrolimus houi and Dendrolimus kikuchii are two sympatric coniferous pests whose pheromones have cis-trans isomers. We used these insect species to detect the precise recognition abilities of PBPs. The four PBPs examined showed male-biased antenna-intensive expression patterns, whereas PBP1 showed higher expression than PBP2 in the antenna. DhouPBP1 only bound to a minor interspecific pheromone component, whereas DhouPBP2 bound to all three intraspecific components and another minor interspecific component. DkikPBP1 and DkikPBP2 could recognize all three intraspecific components with affinities negatively correlated with their ratios, and they bound to interspecific pheromones with affinity that was positively correlated with the ratios. The four PBPs have different cis-trans isomer discrimination abilities, i.e., DhouPBP1 and DkikPBP1 could not discriminate the two cis-trans isomer pairs of pheromones from the two species, whereas DhouPBP2 could discriminate between both pairs, and DkikPBP2 could only discriminate one pair. Overall, PBPs from D. houi and D. kikuchii use different strategies to help the moths to discriminate the intra- and interspecific pheromone components. Our work will contribute to better understanding of the sex pheromone recognition mechanism in these two sister species of moths and provide insights into more effective management practices of these pest species.},

In this research we demostrated that infection with the biotrophic pathogen Golovinomyces cichoracearum (DC.) V.P. Heluta (ex Erysiphe cichoracearum DC.), the causal agent of powdery mildew, led in the susceptible host Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Havana 425 to an increased emission of volatile compounds including Methyl-jasmonate (MeJA), (E)-2-hexenal and (E)-β-ocimene. Furthermore we investigated the role of these volatiles in the plant–pathogen interaction. Exogenous application of MeJA induced in tobacco an increase in the transcripts level of the defence related genes lipoxygenase, allene oxide cyclase and defensin and a decrease in the severity of the infection. Qualitative and quantitative differences in volatile compounds emission were showed also in MeJA-treated plants, where the emission of (E)-β-ocimene was significantly increased instead (E)-2-hexenal was not detected. Application of (E)-2-hexenal reduced the severity of powdery mildew while application of (E)-β-ocimene did not. Since (E)-2-hexenal did not activate in tobacco the accumulation of the above reported genes transcripts and the plant cell death, the reduction of the infection severity could be attributable to its inhibitory activity on the fungal germ tube growth. Our data highlight the contributions of natural substances that can act, directly or indirectly, against phytopathogens. In the global context of sustainability, food safety and environmental protection, such semiochemicals represent an alternative and promising approach to integrated pest management.},

In olfactometer bioassay experiment, aphids showed a preference for the odour of both healthy and infested chrysanthemum, while we found an opposite result in A. annua. Aphids tend to healthy plants compared with the infested, and the phenomenon became obvious with time. Different extracts were tested with the healthy plants and aphid infested plants. Eucalyptol, β-caryophyllene, (E)-β-farnesene, and germacrene D were released as the major constituents in both species. After aphid infesting, we observed a great increase in artemisia ketone and (E)-β-farnesene and a decrease in germacrene D in A. annua; comparatively, eucalyptol, isoborneol and β-caryophyllene increased in chrysanthemum. Combined with the GC–MS data and olfactometer bioassay results we concluded that (E)-β-farnesene and artemisia ketone emitted from A. annua might act as a potential volatile compound to resist aphids, and the two compounds would be useful for future ecological control of aphid in chrysanthemum cultivation.},

We tested in aviary experiments whether males select aromatic plants using olfaction and whether they depend on experience with nest odours they encountered as nestlings. We scented nests of wild starlings with milfoil, Achillea millefolium, a preferred nest plant of the starlings, and other control nests with vanilla. Fledglings from both nest types were hand-reared and tested the following year in dyadic choice experiments for their odour preference. Males from both milfoil- and vanilla-treated nests preferred milfoil scent when they had the choice between milfoil-scented versus vanilla-scented or versus unscented leaves. However, when they had to choose between vanilla scent and no scent, males from vanilla-treated nests chose vanilla scent but males from milfoil-treated nests did not discriminate. The disinterest of vanilla-inexperienced males in vanilla-scented leaves (when milfoil scent was lacking) and the preference for it in vanilla-experienced males implies learning during the nestling period. Because males discriminated between leaves of the same plant species looking the same but scented with different odours and because males without milfoil experience instantly preferred milfoil odour, we conclude that starlings use olfactory cues to select green nest material following an olfactory pattern designed prior to birth which may be supplemented by learning early in ontogeny.},

However, there is little information on the molecular aspect of odor detection about these insects. Furthermore, although lepidopteran species have been widely used in studies of insect olfaction, few work made comparison between sister moths on the olfactory recognition mechanisms. In this study, next-generation sequencing of the antennal transcriptome of these two moths were performed to identify the major olfactory genes. After comparing the antennal transcriptome of these two moths, we found that they exhibit highly similar transcripts-associated GO terms. Chemosensory gene families were further analyzed in both species. We identified 23 putative odorant binding proteins (OBP), 17 chemosensory proteins (CSP), two sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMP), 33 odorant receptors (OR), and 10 ionotropic receptors (IR) in D. houi; and 27 putative OBPs, 17 CSPs, two SNMPs, 33 ORs, and nine IRs in D. kikuchii. All these transcripts were full-length or almost full-length. The predicted protein sequences were compared with orthologs in other species of Lepidoptera and model insects, including Bombyx mori, Manduca sexta, Heliothis virescens, Danaus plexippus, Sesamia inferens, Cydia pomonella, and Drosophila melanogaster. The sequence homologies of the orthologous genes in D. houi and D. kikuchii are very high. Furthermore, the olfactory genes were classed according to their expression level, and the highly expressed genes are our target for further function investigation. Interestingly, many highly expressed genes are ortholog gene of D. houi and D. kikuchii. We also found that the Classic OBPs were further separated into three groups according to their motifs, which will help future functional researches. Surprisingly, no pheromone receptor was identified in the two Dendrolimus species, which may indicate a special pheromone identification mechanism in Dendrolimus. Our work allows for further functional studies of pheromones and host volatile recognition genes, and give novel candidate targets for pest management.},

The biosphere, especially vegetation, releases a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere. Some of these biogenic VOCs are emitted in surprisingly large amounts and have high enough chemical reactivity to significantly affect the chemistry of the atmosphere. Most living systems directly or indirectly exchange volatile chemical compounds with the atmosphere. Over biological time, the major gases exchanged with living organisms have included carbon dioxide, with production by respiring organisms and uptake by photosynthetic and chemoautotrophic organisms; oxygen (O2), with production by photosynthetic organisms and uptake by aerobic respiration; and nitrogen (N2), which is produced by denitrifying bacteria and taken up by nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This chapter describes the major biogenic VOCs emitted by higher plants and the mechanisms of their formation. In addition, the chapter describes the regulation and roles of formation of VOCs and their emission from plant surfaces. The details of these biochemical and biological processes are complex, comparable in complexity to the photochemistry of VOCs in the atmosphere, but need to be appreciated to accurately model regional and global biogenic VOC emissions.},

The chapter analyzes that invertebrate predators, which are abundant in number, can directly affect the population of plant-feeding insects. As the invertebrate predators feed on plant-eating insects, they help in reducing the population of phytophagous arthropods. In the agroecosystem, predator complex helps in reducing the damage caused by insect pests. The chapter also states that the effectiveness of the predators on the phytophagous insects generally depends on certain factors. The factors are generally biotic in nature. Plants can influence the survival and the development of the invertebrate predators. Plants can also directly or indirectly influence the interaction between the invertebrate predators and their prey. Therefore, one can say that the success of the conservation biological control to a great extent depends on the direct or indirect interactions between the predators and their prey. It is important to take necessary steps to conserve predators to have a balanced agroecosystem. The chapter also discusses that to have effective tactics for conservation biological control, one needs to have a clear understanding of how plant affects predators of the phytophagous pests.},

We studied the induction of plant volatiles by a piercing-sucking insect, the western tarnished plant bug Lygus hesperus Knight. Adults of both genders and nymphs of Lygus induced the local emission of a blend of volatiles from both cotton and maize. Feeding by Lygus also induced the systemic emission of volatiles that was similar but less complex than the blend emitted at the site of feeding. Infestation by mated, mature adult females (\&gt;4 days old), but not by nymphs or mature males, caused detectable emission of α-pinene, myrcene, and (E)-β-caryophyllene, compounds that are stored in the glands of cotton tissue. This indicated that damage to glands in the petiole and leaf by the female ovipositor, rather than feeding, contributed significantly to the emission of these volatiles. Girdling the plant stem to disrupt phloem transport markedly decreased the movement of14C-labeled photosynthetic products to the apex of the plant, and this treatment also markedly reduced the amount of systemically induced volatiles caused by Lygus feeding. Lygus salivary gland extracts were capable of inducing emission of the same volatile blend as measured for plants infested by feeding insects or treated with volicitin, an elicitor isolated from caterpillar regurgitant. The results indicate that L. hesperus is capable of inducing the emission of plant volatiles and that induction is caused by an elicitor that is contained in the insect salivary gland.},

	abstract = {Despite recent interest in the non-sugar components of floral nectar, nearly nothing is known about the ecological importance and phylogenetic distribution of scented nectar. If present, the scent of nectar would provide an honest signal to nectar-feeding animals. Nectar odors may directly impact plant reproductive fitness, through pollinator attraction or deterrence of nectar robbers and florivores. In addition, nectar odors may indirectly impact plant fitness through antimicrobial activity, pleiotropic interactions with plant defense, and communication with predators and parasitoids. The literature provides only circumstantial evidence for scented nectar, through the study of bee honey odors. Here I confirm the presence of scent in the nectar of four out of seven angiosperm species sampled with solid-phase micro-extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In Abelia x grandiflora and Hedychium coronarium, nectar odors are a hydrophilic subset of the compounds emitted by surrounding floral tissues, suggesting passive absorption by the nectar standing crop. Sucrose solution applied to the petals of a nectarless flower, Magnolia grandiflora, absorbed a hydrophilic subset of scent compounds after one hour, lending support to this hypothesis. Nectar from Oenothera primiveris and Agave palmeri contained unique scent compounds compared to the floral tissues. The presence of fermentation volatiles in A. palmeri nectar suggests a dynamic role for yeast in its floral biology. These data highlight the need for systematic studies on the distribution and mechanistic importance of scented floral nectar to plant-animal interactions.},

	abstract = {A large body of evidence shows that plants release volatile chemicals upon attack by herbivores. These volatiles influence the performance of natural enemies. Nearly all the evidence on the effect of plant volatiles on natural enemies of herbivores concerns predators, parasitoids, and entomophagous nematodes. However, other entomopathogens, such as fungi, have not been studied yet for the way they exploit the chemical information that the plant conveys on the presence of herbivores. We tested the hypothesis that volatiles emanating from cassava plants infested by green mites (Mononychellus tanajoa) trigger sporulation in three isolates of the acaropathogenic fungus Neozygites tanajoae. Tests were conducted under climatic conditions optimal to fungal conidiation, such that the influence of the plant volatiles could only alter the quantity of conidia produced. For two isolates (Altal.brz and Colal.brz), it was found that, compared with clean air, the presence of volatiles from clean, excised leaf discs suppressed conidia production. This suppressive effect disappeared in the presence of herbivore-damaged leaves for the isolate Colal.brz. For the third isolate, no significant effects were observed. Another experiment differing mainly in the amount of volatiles showed that two isolates produced more conidia when exposed to herbivore-damaged leaves compared with clean air. Taken together, the results show that volatiles from clean plants suppress conidiation, whereas herbivore-induced plant volatiles promote conidiation of N. tanajoae. These opposing effects suggest that the entomopathogenic fungus tunes the release of spores to herbivore-induced plant signals indicating the presence of hosts. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

	abstract = {Plant volatile analysis may be the oldest form of what now is called plant "metabolomic" analysis. A wide array of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as alkanes, alcohols, isoprenoids, and esters, can be collected simultaneously from the plant headspace, either within the laboratory or in the field. Increasingly faster and more sensitive analysis techniques allow detection of an ever-growing number of compounds in decreasing concentrations. However, the myriads of data becoming available from such experiments do not automatically increase our ecological and evolutionary understanding of the roles these VOCs play in plant-insect interactions. Herbivores and parasitoids responding to changes in VOC emissions are able to perceive minute changes within a complex VOC background. Plants modified in genes involved in VOC synthesis may be valuable for the evaluation of changes in plant-animal interactions compared to tests with synthetic compounds, as they allow changes to be made within the context of a more complex profile. We argue that bioinformatics is an essential tool to integrate statistical analysis of plant VOC profiles with insect behavioural data. The implementation of statistical techniques such as multivariate analysis (MVA) and meta-analysis is of the utmost importance to interpreting changes in plant VOC mixtures. MVA focuses on differences in volatile patterns rather than in single compounds. Therefore, it more closely resembles the information processing in insects that base their behavioural decisions on differences in VOC profiles between plants. Meta-analysis of different datasets will reveal general patterns pertaining to the ecological role of VOC in plant-insect interactions. Successful implementation of bioinformatics in VOC research also includes the development of MVA that integrate time-resolved chemical and behavioural analyses, as well as databases that link plant VOCs to their effects on insects. © 2007 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.},

The smell produced by plants has always been recognized for its commercial and aesthetic value and it is emitted not only from flowers and fruits, but also from vegetative tissues. Since approximately two decades, the influence of these scents in a vast array of interactions has been established carrying out physiological, ecological and more recently atmospheric functions. Generally these mixtures consist of terpenes, fatty acid derivatives and aromatic compounds. One of the major volatile's role is their involvement as signals to other organisms, and even for the same plant. Furthermore, they can be exported to modify the environment of the releaser species and influence the behavior of neighbors and enemies. Chemical volatiles have so many functions: in plant reproduction, attracting pollinators or seed dispersers; in chemical defense, repelling insects, avoiding bacterial or fungi phytopathogen colonization, attracting natural enemies of herbivores; or using them like intra and inter specific messengers. The progress on analytical techniques, molecular biology and biochemistry, have allowed the elucidation of biosynthetic pathways, enzymes and genes involved in plant volatiles production and emission, helping to understand, partially, the reason why this kind of compounds perform an active role in organisms and environmental relationships. This review offers a general vision about properties of plant volatiles, including the function that these compounds accomplish in several relationships at different trophic levels.},

The terpenes attract herbivore enemies that attack the herbivore and thereby may reduce the damage to the plant. This interaction was termed 'indirect defense' and will often benefit the plant, but other organisms like parasitic plants or insects and can utilize the volatile signals to their advantage.

	abstract = {Herbivory may induce plant defenses that promote the activity of natural enemies of the herbivores. This so-called induced indirect defense may involve the production of plant volatiles that attract carnivorous arthropods or extrafloral nectar that is exploited as alternative food by carnivorous arthropods. Induced indirect plant defense is mediated by different signal-transduction pathways, such as the jasmonic acid, the salicylic acid, and the ethylene pathways and may involve large-scale transcriptomic re-arrangements. Induced indirect plant defense responses result in an altered phenotype and thus can affect the interactions of the plant with various community members: attackers can be deterred, natural enemies attracted (both above- and belowground), pollinators may change flower visitation, and neighboring plants can exploit the information from the attacked plants to initiate defense responses as well. We discuss several approaches that are commonly used in molecular, chemical and ecological studies of induced indirect plant defenses and identify some remaining knowledge gaps and directions for future research. Integrating a mechanistic approach with a community ecological approach will provide important progress in understanding the selective pressures and dynamics of ecological interactions that are mediated by induced indirect plant defenses, as well as the underlying mechanisms. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The four host plant compounds added to the overdosed pheromone permitted males to take off faster and with a higher probability of flying to the source.

It has been proposed that these volatile signals can be manipulated to improve crop protection. Here, we demonstrate the full potential of this strategy by restoring the emission of a specific belowground signal emitted by insect-damaged maize roots. The western corn root-worm induces the roots of many maize varieties to emit (E)-β- caryophyllene, which attracts entomopathogenic nematodes that infect and kill the voracious root pest. However, most North American maize varieties have lost the ability to emit (E)-β-caryophyllene and may therefore receive little protection from the nematodes. To restore the signal, a nonemitting maize line was transformed with a (E)-β-caryophyllene synthase gene from oregano, resulting in constitutive emissions of this sesquiterpene. In rootworm-infested field plots in which nematodes were released, the (E)-β-caryophyllene- emitting plants suffered significantly less root damage and had 60\% fewer adult beetles emerge than untransformed, nonemitting lines. This demonstration that plant volatile emissions can be manipulated to enhance the effectiveness of biological control agents opens the way for novel and ecologically sound strategies to fight a variety of insect pests.},

	abstract = {During the long term of interaction between plants and the abiotic stresses, and the biotic infestation, plants have evolved complex defensive mechanisms, for instance, plants emit herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) so as to defend themselves against herbivores. HIPVs are the results of co-evolution in tritrophic interactions among plants, herbivores and natural enemies. The chemical compositions of the volatile compounds vary with both plant and herbivorous insect species. Within the various ecosystems, HIPVs play an important role in mediating interactions between plants and arthropods, plants and microorganisms, herbivore-damaging plants and undamaged neighboring plants, as well as damaged parts and undamaged parts of the same plant, and they mediate plants defensive responses. As host location signals, HIPVs play a critical role in attracting predatory and parasitical natural enemies. HIPVs may also act as chemical communication signals among plants, and trigger defensive responses against herbivores. From an ecological or economical point of view, the research and application of HIPVs are of great importance for development of integrated pest management strategy. Previous researches significantly enriched our understanding of insect chemical ecology related to herbivore-induced plant defense. However, a great deal of attention has recently been directed towards elucidating the molecular nature of induced plant resistance. In this review, we address following key issues related to the metabolic regulation mechanisms of HIPVs. First, we discuss the functionality of oral secretions of herbivores in the defense of plants, since plant damages are resulted from both herbivore mouthpart chawing (or piercing) and oral secretions. The synomone inducers Volicitin and β-glucosidase are components of oral secretions, and trigger the release of HIPVs, at least in part, by modulating the wound signals. Subsequently, we address the signal transduction pathways and their regulatory roles in the releases of HIPVs, and discuss-the interaction among various signaling pathways. As for metabolic process of HIPVs, it is regulated by signaling pathways, including jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), ethylene and H2O2. Among which, JA has long been suggested to be an important regulator of HIPVs. Based on the previous studies, we summarize the key metabolic processes of HIPVs and the regulation roles of key enzymes in the main transduction paths. HIPVs discussed in the current paper include terpenes, green leaf volatiles and aromatic compounds derived from shikimic acid pathway such as methyl salicylate (MeSA) and indole. As chemical signaling molecules, some compounds can also activate the expression of defense genes in neighboring plants. Terpene synthases are key enzymes involved in terpenoids production. Lipoxygenase and hydroperoxide lyase are the focuses in recent researches on the metabolic pathway of green leaf volatiles. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase and salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase are key enzymes involved in the formation of SA and its derivative MeSA, respectively. Whereas, the genes of these enzymes regulate the metabolic pathways of HIPVs at transcription level. Finally, we give a brief outlook of the future research and application of HIPVs.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the main factors related to the host colonization of leaf beetles in Chrysomelidae were reviewed. In the host location process of the beetles, plant volatiles, especially herbivore-infested plant volatiles play an important role. Up to now, several Chrysomelids have been shown to orient preferably to herbivore-infested plants whose volatiles differ qualitatively and quantitatively from the undamaged plants and generally are much larger than the latter. Beetle pheromones can also regulate conspecific and heterospecefic behavioral responses. Both male and female adults in this family produce long-range pheromones, which include sex and aggregation pheromones. The pheromones are chemically diverse and consist of either single compound or a blend. Recent studies on Chrysomelid chemical communication have revealed that only male adults produced aggregation pheromones attractive to both sexes and that specific host plant volatiles have a synergistic role with sex or aggregation pheromones. In addition to chemical signals stated as above, the shape and color of the host plants are also the distant signals by which the beetles locate the host. These visual cues have a synergistic role with olfactory cues when Chrysomelids locate the hosts. Once landing on the host plant, the leaf traits, such as morphological characteristics and chemical composition, will influence whether the beetle accepts the host plant or not. The morphological characteristics of the leaves affect the attachment ability of the beetle to the leaf surface. Generally, Chrysomelids like smooth leaf surface. The leaf beetles can also estimate the host suitability by perceiving leaf chemicals, which are mainly secondary metabolites of host plants. Host-specific compounds are sufficient to stimulate feeding. Behavior of Chrysomelids in response to these above signals may be affected by numerous factors, including the physiological status of the beetles, such as reproduction, diapause, hungry, mating or feeding experience. These factors have integrated effects on the host colonization of leaf beetles. For a better understanding of host plant colonization by Chrysomelid, future studies need address, in addition to ecological and behavioral aspects, the molecular mechanisms underlying interactions between host plants and the leaf beetles.},

	abstract = {Plants could release herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) into atmosphere or soil when they are damaged by herbivore insects. These volatiles serve as a language that plants use for their communication and interaction with the surrounding environment. HIPVs are mainly represented by terpenoids, fatty acid derivatives including lipoxygenase pathway products, benzenoids and phenylpropanoids, and various nitrogen and sulfur containing compounds. These chemical compounds have been demonstrated to act as indirect defenses to protect the emitting plant from herbivores and as direct defenses by repelling herbivores or deterring oviposition. That is, the signaling plant can recruit natural enemies of pests by the defensive strategy, thus minimizing further damage to it. Some factors including plant varieties, insect instars, and natural enemy's learning and experience, influence natural enemies to locate their hosts or prey. In fact, most plants are commonly attacked by more than one herbivore. Understanding on natural enemy responses to volatile blends induced by multi-species vs. single-species herbivore is essential to get more realistic situation in volatile composition in an ecological context. The chemical signals also mean that the plant has produced toxic metabolites and proteins, there are more enemies in the vicinity, and the food is scarce and falling, so HIPVs may serve as direct defenses by repelling herbivores or deterring oviposition. On the contrary, Herbivores might also exploit these chemical signals, either to locate suitable food plants or mating partners or to avoid competition, parasitoids, or predators. Generally, roots are attacked by as many, if not more herbivores than above-ground parts. Recent studies have shown that HIPVs emitted from below-ground plant parts could also attract natural enemies of root herbivores, and also to affect aboveground indirect defense and vice versa. Therefore, HIPVs have important ecological roles in intraplant or interplant communication. HIPVs as internal signals allow damaged tissues to warn their neighbors about the presence of herbivores, and trigger an increase in direct and indirect defenses in undamaged tissues. Simultaneously, the neighboring plants could "eavesdrop" the intraplant messages to elicit their own defenses. As an alternative mechanism, the chemical signal might not induce defenses immediately but rather sensitize or ' prime' the neighboring plants for a quick and intense response when damaged by herbivores. Recent published studies suggest that green leaf volatiles, terpenes, MeJA, and MeSA are good candidates for the real airborne signals. The mechanisms responsible for priming against herbivores and ecological function of priming are reviewed. In addition, the main ways that applied volatiles to control pests, their merits and demerits, and some considerable problems in the practical application are discussed.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric ozone (O 3) is an important secondary air pollutant formed as a result of photochemical reactions between primary pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (NO x), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). O 3 concentrations in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) are predicted to continue increasing as a result of anthropogenic activity, which will impact strongly on wild and cultivated plants. O 3 affects photosynthesis and induces the development of visible foliar injuries, which are the result of genetically controlled programmed cell death. It also activates many plant defense responses, including the emission of phytogenic VOCs. Plant emitted VOCs play a role in many eco-physiological functions. Besides protecting the plant from abiotic stresses (high temperatures and oxidative stress) and biotic stressors (competing plants, micro- and macroorganisms), they drive multitrophic interactions between plants, herbivores and their natural enemies e. g., predators and parasitoids as well as interactions between plants (plant-to-plant communication). In addition, VOCs have an important role in atmospheric chemistry. They are O 3 precursors, but at the same time are readily oxidized by O 3, thus resulting in a series of new compounds that include secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). Here, we review the effects of O 3 on plants and their VOC emissions. We also review the state of current knowledge on the effects of ozone on ecological interactions based on VOC signaling, and propose further research directions. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

Receivers must be able to reduce the babel or noise in these VOCs in order to correctly identify the message. For chemical ecologists faced with vast amounts of data on volatile signatures of plants in different ecological contexts, it is imperative to employ accurate methods of classifying messages, so that suitable bioassays may then be designed to understand message content. We demonstrate the utility of 'Random Forests' (RF), a machine-learning algorithm, for the task of classifying volatile signatures and choosing the minimum set of volatiles for accurate discrimination, using data from sympatric Ficus species as a case study. We demonstrate the advantages of RF over conventional classification methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), as well as data-mining algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM), diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLDA) and k-nearest neighbour (KNN) analysis. We show why a tree-building method such as RF, which is increasingly being used by the bioinformatics, food technology and medical community, is particularly advantageous for the study of plant communication using volatiles, dealing, as it must, with abundant noise. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.},

There has also been substantial debate concerning the ecological significance of the process and the evolutionary drivers. Part of this debate has centered on the distance over which signaling between plants occurs in nature. In a recent study we showed that an ozone concentration of 80 ppb, commonly encountered in nature, significantly reduces the distance over which plant-plant signaling occurs in lima bean. We went on to show that degradation of herbivore-induced plant volatiles by ozone is the likely mechanism for this. The key question remaining from our work was that if ozone is degrading the signal in transit between plants, which chemicals are responsible for transmitting the signal in purer air? Here we present the results of a small scale experiment testing the role of the two most significant herbivore-induced terpenes and discuss our results in terms of other reported functions for these chemicals in plant-plant signaling. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.},

	abstract = {Plant volatiles typically occur as a complex mixture of low-molecular weight lipophilic compounds derived from different biosynthetic pathways, and are seemingly produced as part of a defense strategy against biotic and abiotic stress, as well as contributing to various physiological functions of the producer organism. The biochemistry and molecular biology of plant volatiles is complex, and involves the interplay of several biochemical pathways and hundreds of genes. All plants are able to store and emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but the process shows remarkable genotypic variation and phenotypic plasticity. From a physiological standpoint, plant volatiles are involved in three critical processes, namely plant-plant interaction, the signaling between symbiotic organisms, and the attraction of pollinating insects. Their role in these "housekeeping" activities underlies agricultural applications that range from the search for sustainable methods for pest control to the production of flavors and fragrances. On the other hand, there is also growing evidence that VOCs are endowed with a range of biological activities in mammals, and that they represent a substantially under-exploited and still largely untapped source of novel drugs and drug leads.

	abstract = {Heavy metals are important pollutants that can severely impact ecological foodwebs. In addition to direct toxic effects, these contaminants have been suggested to disrupt chemical communication channels between plants and insects that rely on volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We investigated how different concentrations of copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) stress affect the capacity of Zea mays to synthesize VOCs in the presence and absence of herbivorous insects. Hydroponically grown maize exposed to a high and low concentration of either Cu or Cd showed stunted growth and lower photosynthetic capacities. Herbivores feeding on stressed plants also had attenuated growth rates. Heavy metal treatment alone did not induce VOC emission in maize plants; however, the higher Cu dose was found to prime for enhanced volatile production that can be triggered by caterpillar feeding. Cu stress correlated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species in roots and priming of herbivore-induced jasmonic acid in leaves. Plants challenged with Cd and herbivory did not differ in responses compared with herbivore-damaged controls with no heavy metals added to the substrate. For Cu stress, our results support the 'single biochemical mechanism for multiple stressors' model which predicts overlapping signalling and responses to abiotic and biotic stress factors. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

While the mechanisms of interactions with herbivorous insects, that is, the second trophic level, are starting to be understood, it remains unknown how plants mediate the interactions between soil microbes and carnivorous insects, that is, the third trophic level. Using Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 and the aphid Myzus persicae, we evaluate here the underlying mechanisms involved in the plant-mediated interaction between the non-pathogenic rhizobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and the parasitoid Diaeretiella rapae, by combining ecological, chemical and molecular approaches. Rhizobacterial colonization modifies the composition of the blend of herbivore-induced plant volatiles. The volatile blend from rhizobacteria-treated aphid-infested plants is less attractive to an aphid parasitoid, in terms of both olfactory preference behaviour and oviposition, than the volatile blend from aphid-infested plants without rhizobacteria. Importantly, the effect of rhizobacteria on both the emission of herbivore-induced volatiles and parasitoid response to aphid-infested plants is lost in an Arabidopsis mutant (aos/dde2-2) that is impaired in jasmonic acid production. By modifying the blend of herbivore-induced plant volatiles that depend on the jasmonic acid-signalling pathway, root-colonizing microbes interfere with the attraction of parasitoids of leaf herbivores. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {In their natural environment, plants are faced with a multitude of attackers, of which insect herbivores and plant pathogens are an important component. In response to these attacks, plants release volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which play an important role in the communication between plants and the associated community members, such as other herbivores, phytopathogens and the natural enemies of herbivores. While numerous studies have focused on either plant-pathogen or plant-insect interactions, less is known when these two sets of interactions co-occur. Depending on the mode of attack of the pathogen (necrotroph vs. biotroph) or herbivore (chewing vs. piercing-sucking) they will activate different defence pathways in the plant in which the phytohormones salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) play key roles. As these pathways can crosstalk, a pathogen infection can interfere in a plant's defence response to herbivory, and vice versa. Infestation of a plant with organisms inducing SA signalling prior to - or simultaneously with - attack by organisms that induce the JA pathway often suppresses JA signalling. However, the impact of this signalling pathway crosstalk on VOC induction is not clear cut, as there is high variability in the effects on volatile emissions, ranging from suppression to enhanced emission. The effects of the modified volatile blends on the foraging success of carnivorous natural enemies of herbivorous insects have started to be investigated. Foraging success of natural enemies generally withstands this modification of the host-induced VOC blend, but the presence or absence of key compounds is an important determinant of the response of certain carnivores. Further studies incorporating plant-insect and plant-pathogen interactions at different levels of biological integration will provide valuable insight in how plants integrate signals from different suites of attacking organisms into an adaptive defence response. © 2013 The Authors.

When hosts are parasitized by more than one female of the same species (=superparasitism) or females of different species (=multiparasitism), then intrinsic competition occurs for control of host resources. To reduce competition, some parasitoids are able to recognize the difference between parasitized and unparasitized hosts. Inter- and intra-specific host discrimination were investigated in the two sympatric species, the gregarious Cotesia kariyai (Watanabe) and solitary Meteorus pulchricornis (Wesmael), endoparasitoids of the Oriental armyworm Mythimna separata (Walker). To measure host discrimination, choice experiments were conducted in which females of both species foraged and chose between healthy host larvae and hosts initially parasitized by either C. kariyai or M. pulchricornis. An olfactory test was also performed to examine the discrimination behavior of the two parasitoids. Our results showed that, in oviposition choice tests, both braconid female wasps were able to discriminate between unparasitized hosts and from four to seven day-old hosts previously attacked by conspecific and heterospecific wasps. On the other hand, superparasitism and multiparasitism occurred even in host larvae that were parasitized two days earlier. However, once the immature parasitoids hosts are at larval stage (1st and 2nd instar), super- and multiparasitism were avoided in the two-choice test, but the latter often occurred in the multiple-choice experiment. Host discrimination abilities may have been based on plant volatile signals incurred from damaged plants and internal mechanisms from four to seven post-parasitized hosts. © 2013 International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC).},

A recent study demonstrated that these networks can act as conduits for aphidinduced signals between plants, activating chemical defenses in uninfested neighboring plants so that they become unattractive to aphids but attractive to their enemies (parasitoids). The benefit to the neighboring plants will increase if the signal speed is rapid, enabling them to respond before aphids attack. Here, we determine the speed of aphid-induced signal transfer between plants infested with aphids ("donor") and neighboring aphid-free plants that were either connected or unconnected to the donor via a common mycelial network. Induced changes in plant volatiles from neighbors connected to donors started within 24 h of aphid infestation of donors. This demonstrates a rapid signal, implying potential benefit to plants receiving the signal, and raises intriguing ecological and evolutionary questions. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.},

Small C6 molecules termed green-leaf volatiles form a general element in most of these blends; however, the overall composition is usually sufficiently specific that other organisms are able to determine the nature of the attacker. Receivers of herbivore-induced volatile organic compounds (HI-VOCs) comprise distant parts of the same plant ('within-plant signalling'), neighbouring plants ('plant-plant signalling'), herbivores, and multiple carnivores that respond to the 'plant's cry for help', such as parasitoids and hyperparasitoids, entomopathogenic nematodes, and predatory mites, beetles, bugs and birds. In spite of intensive research efforts, many central questions still remain. How do plants perceive volatiles? What is the relative impact of each of the interactions with different receivers of HI-VOCs on the fitness of the emitting plant and that of the interacting organisms? How long can these compounds remain stable in the atmosphere? Why are VOC-mediated effects on herbivores and beneficial organisms not used as a common tool in sustainable agriculture?

This phenomenon is called plant-plant communication. Here, we outline studies on plant-plant communication from both ecological and plant physiological perspectives. Regarding the ecological perspective, we give an overview of studies showing that plant-plant communication affect direct and indirect defense levels of exposed plants, and herbivore performance on exposed plants. Cases of kin selection in plant-plant communications and intra-plant communication via airborne signals are also summarized. Regarding the plant physiological perspective, we give an overview of studies that showed specific responses of receiver plants to a volatile molecular species, to different configurations of a volatile molecular species and to blends of volatiles. Furthermore, we review the signaling pathways involved, priming, sensitivity, and how plants receive volatile compounds in plant-plant communications. © 2014, Japanese Society for Plant Cell and Molecular Biology.

	abstract = {Plant volatiles mediate host discrimination and host finding in phytophagous insects. Understanding how insects recognize these signals is a current challenge in chemical ecology research. Pear ester, ethyl (E, Z)-2,4-decadienoate, is a powerful, bisexual attractant of codling moth Cydia pomonella (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) and strongly synergizes the male response to female-produced sex pheromone. We show here that the codling moth odorant receptor (OR) CpomOR3 is dedicated to detecting this plant volatile. Heterologous expression of CpomOR3 in Drosophila T1 trichoid and ab3A basiconic sensilla, followed by a screening with codling moth pheromone compounds and known plant volatile attractants, confirms that CpomOR3 binds to pear ester. Although CpomOR3 does not respond to any of the pheromone components tested, a phylogenetic analysis of lepidopteran chemosensory receptor genes reveals a close relationship of CpomOR3 with pheromone receptors (PRs) in moths. This corroborates the interaction of ecological and social chemosensory cues during premating communication. The finding that a plant volatile compound, pear ester, is a specific ligand for a PR-like lepidopteran receptor adds to our understanding of insect-plant interactions and emphasizes the interaction of natural and sexual selection during the phylogenetic divergence of insect herbivores. © 2014 Bengtsson, Gonzalez, Cattaneo, Montagné, Walker, Bengtsson, Anfora, Ignell, Jacquin-Joly and Witzgall.},

	abstract = {Olfaction is an important sense for many animals, yet its role in foraging by herbivores is poorly known. Many plants contain volatile compounds, such as terpenes, that are not only volatile but can be toxic if ingested. Volatile terpenes can be used by herbivores to assess leaf quality, but there is little evidence for whether they are also used as a searching cue. We applied the giving-up density (GUD) framework to examine fine-scale foraging by two free-ranging mammalian herbivores, the brush-tail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and the swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor), using patches with food and an inedible matrix that varied in content of a volatile terpene, 1,8-cineole. We tested the effect of (1) increasing dietary cineole concentration, and (2) masking the food odor by adding cineole to the inedible matrix, thus overriding the smell released by the diet. In both species GUD was affected by dietary cineole; a high cineole concentration raised GUD, consistent with its role as a toxin. There was a significant effect of masking on GUD for wallabies but not for possums, suggesting that odor was an important foraging cue at the feeding patch only for the former. Differences in ecological niche and diet may explain this pattern. We suggest that herbivores, such as the swamp wallaby, opportunistically eavesdrop on plant volatiles, i.e., take advantage of the signal proffered for a different function. The cost of this eavesdropping for plants, however, is presumably counteracted by other ecological benefits of these volatiles, including a reduction in leaf consumption as a function of toxicity. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Summary: Plants that express resistance to herbivores emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can trigger resistance responses in undamaged neighbours. Recent reports indicate that VOCs can also trigger the resistance to pathogens, an effect that might be due to different mechanisms: the priming of an induced expression of resistance genes in the receiver or direct inhibitory effects on microbial pathogens that cause a passive 'associational' resistance in the VOC-exposed plant. We investigated whether VOCs emitted from a resistant common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) cultivar enhance the resistance to the fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum in a susceptible cultivar and analysed whether specific VOCs are likely to directly affect the pathogen. We found that susceptible plants exposed to the headspace of resistance-expressing plants over 6 h became phenotypically as resistant as the resistant cultivar. Several resistance marker genes (PATHOGENESIS-RELATED [PR] 1, 2 and 4) were primed in VOC-exposed susceptible plants. After challenging, these genes reached expression levels at least as high as in the resistant cultivar. Additionally, individual VOCs such as limonene, linalool, nonanal, methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate at natural concentrations directly inhibited the germination of conidia as did also the headspace of a resistance-expressing plant. This inhibition of conidial germination was dosage-dependent and irreversible. Synthesis. We conclude that VOCs are involved in the resistance of bean to fungal pathogens. They can contribute to the direct resistance in the emitter itself, and resistance phenotypes of neighbouring receiver plants can result from induced as well as associational resistance. Plant VOCs play multiple roles in the resistance of plants to microbial pathogens. We conclude that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are involved in the resistance of bean to fungal pathogens.

	abstract = {Introduction Understanding the complex chemical signalling of plants and insects is an important component of chemical ecology. Accordingly, the collection and analysis of chemical cues from plants in their natural environment is integral to elucidation of plant-insect communications. Remote plant locations and the need for a large number of replicates make in situ headspace analyses a daunting logistical challenge. A hand-held, portable GC-MS system was used to discriminate between damaged and undamaged Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle) flower heads in both a potted-plant and natural setting. Objective To determine if a portable GC-MS system was capable of distinguishing between undamaged and mechanically damaged plant treatments, and plant environments. Methodology A portable GC-MS utilising needle trap adsorbent technology was used to collect and analyse in situ headspace volatiles of varying yellow starthistle treatments. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to distinguish treatments and identify biomarker volatiles. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine differences between treatment volatile amounts. Results The portable GC-MS system detected 31 volatiles from the four treatments. Each GC-MS run was completed in less than 3 min. PCA showed four distinct clusters representing the four treatments - damaged and undamaged potted plant, and damaged and undamaged natural plant. Damage-specific volatiles were identified. Conclusion The portable GC-MS system distinguished the treatments based on their detected volatile profiles. Additional statistical analysis identified five possible biomarker volatiles for the treatments, among them cyclosativene and copaene, which indicated damaged flower heads.

	abstract = {Plant volatiles play crucial roles in signaling between plants and their associated community members, but their role in within-plant signaling remains largely unexplored, particularly under field conditions. Using a system comprising the hybrid aspen (Populus tremula x tremuloides) and the specialized herbivorous leaf beetle (Phratora laticollis) and, combining field, greenhouse and laboratory experiments, we examined whether local damage triggered systemic responses in undamaged branches that lack vascular connection to the damaged branches, and to what extent this was caused by airborne volatile signals versus internal signals. An experiment tracing dye through the vasculature of saplings revealed no downward movement of the dye from upper to lower branches, suggesting a lack of vascular connectivity among branches. However, we found under both field and laboratory conditions that herbivore feeding on upper branches elicited volatile emissions by undamaged lower branches. Greenhouse experiments manipulating air contact between damaged and undamaged branches showed that systemic induction of volatiles was almost eliminated when air contact was interrupted. Our findings clearly demonstrate that herbivore-induced volatiles overcome vascular constraints and mediate within-plant signaling. Further, we found that volatile signaling led to induction of different classes of volatiles under field and environment controlled conditions, with a weaker response observed in the field. This difference not only reflects the dose- and time-dependent nature of volatile signaling, but also points out that future studies should focus more on field observations to better understand the ecological role of volatile-mediated within-plant signaling. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Plant communication has been documented in over 35 plant species spanning 16 families to date; however, the underlying mechanisms through which it shapes plants' ecological interactions remain less clear. Using a combination of field/laboratory bioassays, headspace volatile and leaf chemical analyses in tall goldenrod (Solidago altissima), we tested the hypothesis that plant-to-plant communication affects the performance, feeding and movement behaviour of herbivores by changing plants' chemical phenotypes. We found that plant communication accelerates herbivore movement between host plants while simultaneously reducing herbivory. This suggests that plant communication can limit herbivore loads by keeping herbivores on the move between host plants. We demonstrate that volatile chemicals emitted from herbivore-attacked plants are sufficient to explain metabolic responses in and ecological consequences for the exposed neighbour plant. Volatile profiles of beetle (Trirhabda virgata)-damaged and undamaged plants show substantial compositional differences, especially in sesquiterpene emission, indicating that these differences have the potential to provide neighbouring plants with specific information about herbivores in the vicinity. Despite qualitative and phenological differences in plants' metabolic responses to herbivory-induced volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and feeding herbivores, herbivores nonetheless respond similarly to directly damaged plants and plants exposed to VOCs from damaged neighbours as if they were of equivalently poor quality. This study suggests that by enlarging the spatial scale at which induced resistance affects the distribution of plant chemical phenotypes in plant populations, VOC-mediated plant communication alters the movement behaviour and performance of herbivores.

	abstract = {The chemical ecology of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), has been the subject of a worldwide research effort spanning five decades. The initial focus of this work was the characterization of codling moth sexual behavior and the identification of its sex pheromone, followed by the development of effective monitoring and management programs. Subsequently, a large body of work was dedicated to deciphering the chemical messaging systems that exist between both moth sexes and their apple host. However, it was from pear that a potent kairomone, pear ester, ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate, was discovered, and surprisingly from field studies in walnut. Pear ester over the last decade has been the basis for the development of a range of commercial products that impact larval and adult behaviors and reduce levels of fruit injury. A review of codling moth and behavioral-active apple volatiles, the discovery of pear ester, and the development of useful technologies is provided here. A recounting of this story provides some considerations for the reader. First, that single odorants from a host e.g. (E,E)-α-farnesene and pear ester and maybe not complex volatile blends that more thoroughly characterize a host odor, are fruitful targets to develop female attractants. However, practical concerns such as chemical stability and synthesis cost will limit the implementation of any discovery. Second, it is not clear what semiochemical evoked behaviors should be targeted to develop an effective lure, i.e. suitable host for sexual rendezvous, oviposition, or as a food source. Background odors from immature fruits and undamaged foliage are generally more dilute and less complex than from ripening fruits or damaged foliage. Thus, effective chemical signals need to be more intense and apparent to lure moths. Third, it appears that adding acetic acid to host plant volatile lures is effective in drawing moths into traps, perhaps as a short-range food cue. Fourth, it was a field bioassay with a pear volatile in a walnut grove that unveiled the power of pear ester. Only later did a series of physiological and molecular studies detail the evolved interplay of pear ester and sex pheromone in the brain of codling moth. It is possible that this more basic approach will in the future allow the purposeful discovery of new attractants which can aid pest management of tortricids and other pest species. But more likely, chemists and applied insect ecologists need to continue to identify, synthesize, and test the various semiochemicals that define the lives of insects. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

These VOCs, released as a mixture of lipophilic compounds with low molecular weight, are produced by different biosynthetic pathways and actively participate in plant defensive strategies against both abiotic and biotic stress factors. Among them, plant-plant interaction, the attraction of pollinators and/or parasitoids and the signaling between symbiont organisms, are the most documented. The development of techniques aimed in trapping, analyze, identify, and quantify plant volatiles, coupled to the evolution of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analytical methods, as well as the possibility to monitor in-vivo the changes in VOCs production, has significantly increased our knowledge concerning VOCs biosynthesis and their ecological role. This chapter will introduce an overview concerning the ecological role of plant volatiles as well as the biosynthetic pathways involved in their production.

	abstract = {Plants and microorganisms (microbes) use information from chemicals such as volatile compounds to understand their environments. Proficiency in sensing and responding to these infochemicals increases an organ-ism’s ecological competence and ability to survive in competitive environments, particularly with regard to plant-pathogen interactions. Plants and microbes acquired the ability to sense and respond to biogenic volatiles during their evolutionary history. However, these signals can only be interpreted by humans through the use of state-of the-art technologies. Newly-developed tools allow microbe-induced plant volatiles to be detected in a rapid, precise, and non-invasive manner to diagnose plant diseases. Beside disease diagnosis, volatile compounds may also be valuable in improving crop productivity in sustainable agriculture. Bacterial volatile compounds (BVCs) have potential for use as a novel plant growth stimulant or as improver of fertilizer efficiency. BVCs can also elicit plant innate immunity against insect pests and microbial pathogens. Research is needed to expand our knowledge of BVCs and to produce BVC-based formulations that can be used practically in the field. Formulation possibilities include encapsulation and sol-gel matrices, which can be used in attract and kill formulations, chemigation, and seed priming. Exploitation of biogenic volatiles will facilitate the development of smart integrated plant management systems for disease control and productivity improvement. © The Korean Society of Plant Pathology.},

This study reviews the role of microbe-induced plant volatiles (MIPVs) in plant–microbe interactions. MIPVs are affected by the taxonomic position of the microbe, the identity of the plant and the type of interaction. Plants also emit exclusive blends of volatiles in response to nonhost and host interactions, as well as to beneficial microbes and necrotrophic/biotrophic pathogens. These MIPVs directly inhibit pathogen growth and indirectly promote resistance/susceptibility to subsequent plant pathogen attack. Viruses and phloem-limiting bacteria modify plant volatiles to attract insect vectors. Susceptible plants can respond to MIPVs from resistant plants and become resistant. Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of MIPV synthesis in plants and how plant pathogen effectors manipulate their biosynthesis are discussed.

However, whether synthetic HIPVs can be employed to enhance biological control in a cultivated crop in the field is yet to be explored. Here we show that a biodegradable formulation loaded with induced and food-signaling volatiles can selectively recruit the common green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea, and reduce pest population under field conditions. In apple orchards, the new formulation attracted lacewing adults over a 4-week period, which correlated well with independent assessments of the longevity of the slow-release matrix measured through chemical analyses. In barley, lacewing eggs and larvae were significantly more abundant in treated plots, whereas a significant reduction of two aphid species was measured (98.9\% and 93.6\% of population reduction, for Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi, respectively). Results show the potential for semiochemical-based targeted recruitment of lacewings to enhance biological control of aphids in a field setting. Further research should enhance selective recruitment by rewarding attracted natural enemies and by optimizing the application technique. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Olfaction is an essential sensory modality for insects and their olfactory environment is mostly made up of plant-emitted volatiles. The terrestrial vegetation produces an amazing diversity of volatile compounds, which are then transported, mixed, and degraded in the atmosphere. Each insect species expresses a set of olfactory receptors that bind part of the volatile compounds present in its habitat. Insect odorscapes are thus defined as species-specific olfactory spaces, dependent on the local habitat, and dynamic in time. Manipulations of pest-insect odorscapes are a promising approach to answer the strong demand for pesticide-free plant-protection strategies. Moreover, understanding their olfactory environment becomes a major concern in the context of global change and environmental stresses to insect populations. A considerable amount of information is available on the identity of volatiles mediating biotic interactions that involve insects. However, in the large body of research devoted to understanding how insects use olfaction to locate resources, an integrative vision of the olfactory environment has rarely been reached. This article aims to better apprehend the nature of the insect odorscape and its importance to insect behavioral ecology by reviewing the literature specific to different disciplines from plant ecophysiology to insect neuroethology. First, we discuss the determinants of odorscape composition, from the production of volatiles by plants (section “Plant Metabolism and Volatile Emissions”) to their filtering during detection by the olfactory system of insects (section “Insect Olfaction: How Volatile Plant Compounds Are Encoded and Integrated by the Olfactory System”). We then summarize the physical and chemical processes by which volatile chemicals distribute in space (section “Transportation of Volatile Plant Compounds and Spatial Aspects of the Odorscape”) and time (section “Temporal Aspects: The Dynamics of the Odorscape”) in the atmosphere. The following sections consider the ecological importance of background odors in odorscapes and how insects adapt to their olfactory environment. Habitat provides an odor background and a sensory context that modulate the responses of insects to pheromones and other olfactory signals (section “Ecological Importance of Odorscapes”). In addition, insects do not respond inflexibly to single elements in their odorscape but integrate several components of their environment (section “Plasticity and Adaptation to Complex and Variable Odorscapes”). We finally discuss existing methods of odorscape manipulation for sustainable pest insect control and potential future developments in the context of agroecology (section “Odorscapes in Plant Protection and Agroecology”).

In contrast to model plants, reports on HIPV formation and function in crops are limited. Tea (Camellia sinensis) is an important crop in China. α-Farnesene is a common HIPV produced in tea plants in response to diαerent herbivore attacks. In this study, a C. sinensis α-farnesene synthase (CsAFS) was isolated, cloned, sequenced, and functionally characterized. The CsAFS recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli was able to transform farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into α-farnesene and also convert geranyl diphosphate (GPP) to β-ocimene in vitro. Furthermore, transient expression analysis in Nicotiana benthamiana plants indicated that CsAFS was located in the cytoplasm and could convert FPP to α-farnesene in plants. Wounding, to simulate herbivore damage, activated jasmonic acid (JA) formation, which significantly enhanced the CsAFS expression level and α-farnesene content. This suggested that herbivore-derived wounding induced α-farnesene formation in tea leaves. Furthermore, the emitted α-farnesene might act as a signal to activate antibacterial-related factors in neighboring undamaged tea leaves. This research advances our understanding of the formation and signaling roles of common HIPVs in crops such as tea plants. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Plants and microbes have complex communication systems with important consequences for agriculture, human health, and ecosystem functioning. Eavesdropping, however, has mostly been studied in animal systems. In this review, we argue that eavesdropping is an important force shaping the ecology and evolution of communication in these non-animal systems. To date, studying eavesdropping in plants and microbes has been limited by the fact that signaler “intention” is often unclear: distinguishing signals that evolved to convey information from unintended cues is particularly difficult in plants and microbes, and the fitness consequences of signaling are rarely measured. We describe some of the main examples of eavesdropping in plant and microbial communication and point out other murkier cases were the molecular and physiological basis of communication are well-understood, but the evolutionary implications have not been addressed. We argue that these systems provide experimental tractability to test some of the predicted ecological and evolutionary consequences of eavesdropping, and that the particularities of these systems can lead to an increased understanding of eavesdropping, and its importance in biological communication. © Copyright © 2019 Rebolleda-Gómez and Wood.},

The ratio of chemical stimulus to solvent is maintained until the liquid is dispersed and therefore the release rate of the chemical stimulus can be set and calculated straight-forwardly from the dilution factor and the dynamically controllable speed of the syringe plunger. The sprayer permits the delivery of chemical stimulus independent of relative vapor pressures of the components and of environmental factors such as temperature.

However, numerous studies indicate that this is not always the case for polyphagous species. Lymantria dispar is a highly polyphagous forest defoliator and has flightless females in some subspecies, resulting in a limited capacity to make host-choices. Males of other Lepidopteran species utilize a combination of sexual pheromones and plant volatiles in their mating choices and exhibit preferences among plant species. We explored the behavior of L. dispar males towards sexual pheromone in the presence and absence of plant volatiles and their ability to discriminate between two plant species with different degrees of suitability for their offspring: a suboptimal host (Pinus sylvestris), and an optimal host (Quercus robur). In no-choice wind tunnel assays, we found that rates of male success in locating a pheromone source were not altered by the presence of plant odors; however, the time spent by males searching for the pheromone source after reaching the full length of the tunnel was reduced by more than 50\% in the presence of plant volatiles. In dual choice assays, males exhibited a clear preference for a combination of pheromones and plant volatiles over the pheromone alone. However, we did not find evidence of an innate ability to discriminate between the odors of optimal and suboptimal host plants. We discuss possible ecological and evolutionary explanations for these observations.},

Caloptilia fraxinella is a herbivorous specialist on the foliage of ash trees (Fraxinus). Adults are long-lived and undergo a nine-month reproductive diapause over the fall and winter. Mating and oviposition occur in the spring when volatile chemicals released by ash leaves mediate host location. This study tested the plasticity of olfactory response of C. fraxinella to host plant volatiles using both electroantennogram and behavioral bioassays. The effect of moth physiological state on olfactory response was tested on male and female moths in different nutritional, mating, and diapause states. Antennal responses to host plant volatiles were plastic and depended on moth physiological state, and were highest when moths were reproductively active and would be seeking oviposition hosts. Moth sex and nutritional status also impacted antennal response to host plant volatiles. Oriented flight of females to ash seedlings varied with physiological state and nutritional status, with fed, reproductively active females having the highest response. Physiological state impacted oriented flight of males to female-produced sex pheromone signals whether or not a host plant was present, and there was no increase in behavioral response to sex pheromone in the presence of an ash host.},

Prior to its invasion into these regions, little was known about its chemical ecology. However, since then, researchers have identified and synthesized its aggregation pheromone, documented its synergism with the pheromone of another Asian stink bug, Plautia stali, developed monitoring traps of various designs, and lures with reliable attractants have become commercially available. Furthermore, plant volatiles have been shown to have attractive, neutral, and repellent effects on attraction and retention of H. halys, and H. halys-derived volatiles have been shown to play a role in recruiting natural enemies. Finally, management strategies based on pheromone-based technology have been evaluated, including insecticide applications based on a cumulative threshold of adult captures in pheromone-baited traps, and the use of intensively baited trees in an attract-and-kill strategy to manage this pest.

	abstract = {Infochemicals play an important role in structuring intra-and interspecific interactions. Many parasitoid wasp species rely on herbivory or oviposition-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs/OIPVs) to locate their herbivorous hosts, and must cope with variation in the volatile blends due to factors such as plant/host species, herbivore density or attack by several herbivores. However, little is known about how dual herbivory or changes in herbivore density affect multiple parasitoid species, each attacking a different herbivore, in the same system. In a natural system, we investigated the effect of dual attack on the ability of three parasitoid species to differentiate between volatiles induced by hosts and those induced by a combination of hosts and nonhosts. Black mustard, Brassica nigra, plants were infested with eggs or caterpillars of Pieris brassicae, alone or in combination with different densities of Brevicoryne brassicae aphids. We determined the ability of three different parasitoid species that parasitize either P. brassicae eggs (Trichogramma brassicae), caterpillars (Cotesia glomerata) or B. brassicae aphids (Diaeretiella rapae) to discriminate between the induced volatiles, and analysed the plant volatile blends. Dual infestation did not affect the parasitoid species equally and aphid infestation altered, in a density-dependent manner, the volatile-mediated foraging of all three parasitoid species. Chemical analyses of the volatile blends revealed nonlinear emission patterns in relation to aphid density in both plants attacked by aphids alone and in plants attacked by a combination of aphids and caterpillars. Simple correlations between behaviour and volatile emissions in pairwise comparisons suggest the importance of certain volatiles explaining attraction, whereas dose-response type analyses reveal that these simple correlation analyses provide an incomplete picture.

	abstract = {Plant odours are the most ubiquitous volatiles in nature. This chapter deals with the biochemistry and molecular biology of plant volatiles that are emitted from vegetative tissues during pathogen- or herbivore-induced stress and the contribution of these volatiles to plant defences. While mechanical tissue wounding causes the non-specific release of volatiles, herbivore-specific elicitors from their saliva distinctly alter the volatile signature. These volatiles acquired diverse roles in ecological interactions. Firstly, they can be toxic to, or repel conspecific or other herbivores from already infested plants. This function is referred to as 'direct defence'. Secondly, volatiles function as prey-associated signals for foraging carnivorous arthropods. This is referred to as 'indirect defence'. Finally, volatiles elicit metabolic changes in unattacked neighbouring plants resulting in priming and induction of defences already before herbivores have arrived. This is referred to as 'plant-plant communication'. Although volatile production by native plants and crops is highly variable under different growth conditions and during development, its function in direct and indirect defences is remarkably robust. With the current state of knowledge, it is now possible to manipulate these direct and indirect defences through breeding or transgenic approaches. Taken together, plant volatiles play profound roles in plant-herbivore and plant-pathogen interactions and are promising targets for improved crop protection.},

	abstract = {Although odour-mediated interactions among plants, spider mites and predatory mites have been extensively studied above-ground, belowground studies are in their infancy. In this paper, we investigate whether feeding by rust mites (Aceria tulipae) cause tulip bulbs to produce odours that attract predatory mites (Neoseiulus cucumeris). Since our aim was to demonstrate such odours and not their relevance under soil conditions, the experiments were carried out using a classic Y-tube olfactometer in which the predators moved on a Y-shaped wire in open air. We found that food-deprived female predators can discriminate between odours from infested bulbs and odours from uninfested bulbs or artificially wounded bulbs. No significant difference in attractiveness to predators was found between clean bulbs and bulbs either wounded 30 min or 3 h before the experiment. These results indicate that it may not be simply the wounding of the bulbs, but rather the feeding by rust mites, which causes the bulb to release odours that attract N. cucumeris. Since bulbs are belowground plant structures, the olfactometer results demonstrate the potential for odour-mediated interactions in the soil. However, their importance in the actual soil medium remains to be demonstrated.},

Plant-parasitoid interactions are a fundamental component of such systems with profound implications both for parasitoid foraging efficiency and plant defense. Chemical, plant-based cues are the dominant cues used by parasitoids in long-range foraging to locate cryptic, highly-dispersed hosts within a complex physical and chemical environment. It is well documented that volatile chemical signals produced and released by plants specifically in response to herbivore feeding play an important role in parasitoid foraging. New evidence suggests that, in addition to being highly detectable and reliable indicators of herbivore presence, herbivore-induced plant volatiles may convey herbivore-specific information that allows parasitoids to discriminate even closely-related herbivore species at long range.},

We studied the chemical signals mediating interactions between the egg parasitoid, its host, and the plant Ulmus campestris. Olfactometer bioassays with O. gallerucae showed that volatiles of the host-plant complex attract the parasitoid. In order to determine the source of attractive volatiles within this host-plant-complex, we tested separately the effect of odours of eggs, gravid elm leaf beetle females, faeces of the beetles and elm twigs (with undamaged leaves and leaves damaged either mechanically or by feeding of the beetles). Odours of faeces of the elm leaf beetle were attractive, whereas neither volatiles from eggs nor from gravid females acted as attractants. Volatiles from undamaged or damaged plants did not elicit a positive reaction in O. gallerucae, whereas volatiles from feeding-damaged plants onto which host eggs had been deposited were attractive. This latter result suggests that it is not feeding but deposition of host eggs onto elm leaves that induces the production of plant volatiles attractive to the egg parasitoid. Investigations of the search patterns of O. gallerucae within the habitat by laboratory bioassays revealed that the egg parasitoid encounters host eggs by chance. Contact kairomones from faeces were demonstrated to be important in microhabitat acceptance, while contact kairomones isolated from the host eggs are relevant for host recognition.},

Recent studies suggest that rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations will affect the semiochemistry of plant-insect relationships, possibly altering prey-finding behaviour. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations affect the oviposition behaviour of an aphidophagous hoverfly and alter the development of its larvae. We also test the hypothesis that volatile compounds released by the plant-aphid association are modified under elevated CO2. Broad bean plants infested with pea aphids are grown under ambient (450ppm) or elevated CO2 (800ppm) concentrations. Plants raised under each treatment are then presented to gravid hoverfly females in a dual-choice bioassay. In addition, emerging Episyrphus balteatus larvae are directly fed with aphids reared under ambient or elevated CO2 conditions and then measured and weighed daily until pupation. Odours emitted by the plant-aphid association are sampled. A larger number of eggs is laid on plants grown under ambient CO2 conditions. However, no significant difference is observed between the two groups of predatory larvae grown under different CO2 concentrations, indicating that the CO2 concentration does not affect the quality of their aphid diet. Although plant volatiles do not differ between the ambient and elevated CO2-treated plants, we find that the quantity of aphid alarm pheromone is lower on the plant-aphid association raised under the elevated CO2 condition. This suggests that an alteration of semiochemical emissions by elevated CO2 concentrations impacts the oviposition behaviour of aphid predators.},

In greenhouse crops, several entomophagous species (predators and parasitoids) are used simultaneously in the crop cycle. One important aspect of these crops, which represent modified ecosystems, is the interactions among complexes of species, including plants, phytophagous insects, and predators. The chemical relationships (semiochemicals: pheromones and kairomones) among these species likely play an important role in greenhouse crops; however, few studies have focused on these relationships. The aim of this study was to analyse the importance of semiochemicals. Three groups of laboratory trials were conducted with two predatory species: Nabis pseudoferus and Nesidiocoris tenuis (Hemiptera: Nabidae and Miridae, respectively). The results of the first group of trials indicated that the adult females of both species were more attracted to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) than they were to the control plants or plants with artificial damage. Based on the second group of trials, pheromones triggered an attraction in adult females of both species for conspecifics. Finally, based on the interactions of the adult females of the same species, pheromones changed or modulated the predatory responses to HIPVs. The implications of these results for the biological control of pest species in greenhouses are further discussed.},

Here we present details on the procedure that was used to isolate volicitin and the biosasays that demonstrate its potency as an elicitor of maize volatiles that attract parasitoids. With a series of liquid chromatography purification steps, volicitin was separated from all other inactive substances in the regurgitant of larvae of the noctuid moth S. exigua. Maize seedlings that were incubated in very low concentrations of pure natural volicitin released relatively large amounts of terpenoids and became highly attractive to the parasitoid Microplitis croceipes. The identification of this and other insect-derived elicitors should allow us to determine their precise source and function, and better understand the evolutionary history of the phenomenon of herbivore-induced volatile emissions in plants.},

(Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), as a model species to test the hypothesis that variation in sugar diet of parasitoids affects their olfactory response to host-related odors. Heliothis virescens is a major pest of cotton and other important crops. Response of female M. croceipes fed different diet treatments (i.e., 40\%, 20\%, 10\%, or 0\% sucrose/water solution [w/v]) to select cotton volatiles were tested in electroantennogram (EAG) and Y-tube olfactometer bioassays. The following cotton plant odors were tested: cis-3-hexenol, a-pinene, 50/50 v/v binary mixture of cis-3-hexenol and a-pinene, and H. virescens-infested cotton. Sucrose-fed parasitoids showed higher EAG response to the binary mixture and host-infested plant volatile extract, compared with sucrose-starved (0\% sucrose) parasitoids. However, there was no significant difference in EAG response of parasitoids to odor treatments among individuals fed 40\%, 20\%, or 10\% sucrose. In a Y-tube olfactometer, female M. croceipes fed 40\% sucrose were significantly more attracted to host-infested cotton than to a control (no plant). However, parasitoids were not significantly attracted to other odor stimuli. These results suggest that the availability of sugar diet affects odor reception in M. croceipes but variation in sugar concentration probably plays a minimal role in olfactory response of M. croceipes to host-related odors.},

	doi = {10.1111/eea.12493},
	abstract = {Extensive research has been conducted to reveal how species diversity affects ecosystem functions and services. Yet, consequences of diversity loss for ecosystems as a whole as well as for single community members are still difficult to predict. Arthropod communities typically are species-rich, and their species interactions, such as those between herbivores and their predators or parasitoids, may be particularly sensitive to changes in community composition. Parasitoids forage for herbivorous hosts by using herbivore-induced plant volatiles (indirect cues) and cues produced by their host (direct cues). However, in addition to hosts, non-suitable herbivores are present in a parasitoid's environment which may complicate the foraging process for the parasitoid. Therefore, ecosystem changes in the diversity of herbivores may affect the foraging efficiency of parasitoids. The effect of herbivore diversity may be mediated by either species numbers per se, by specific species traits, or by both. To investigate how diversity and identity of non-host herbivores influence the behaviour of parasitoids, we created environments with different levels of non-host diversity. On individual plants in these environments, we complemented host herbivores with 1-4 non-host herbivore species. We subsequently studied the behaviour of the gregarious endoparasitoid Cotesia glomerata L. (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) while foraging for its gregarious host Pieris brassicae L. (Lepidoptera: Pieridae). Neither non-host species diversity nor non-host identity influenced the preference of the parasitoid for herbivore-infested plants. However, after landing on the plant, non-host species identity did affect parasitoid behaviour, whereas non-host diversity did not. One of the non-host species, Trichoplusia ni Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), reduced the time the parasitoid spent on the plant as well as the number of hosts it parasitized. We conclude that non-host herbivore species identity has a larger influence on C. glomerata foraging behaviour than non-host species diversity. Our study shows the importance of species identity over species diversity in a multitrophic interaction of plants, herbivores, and parasitoids.},

	abstract = {Male moths are confronted with complex odour mixtures in a natural environment when flying towards a female-emitted sex pheromone source. Whereas synergistic effects of sex pheromones and plant odours have been observed at the behavioural level, most investigations at the peripheral level have shown an inhibition of pheromone responses by plant volatiles, suggesting a potential role of the central nervous system in reshaping the peripheral information. We thus investigated the interactions between sex pheromone and a behaviourally active plant volatile, heptanal, and their effects on responses of neurons in the pheromone-processing centre of the antennal lobe, the macroglomerular complex, in the moth Agrotis ipsilon. Our results show that most of these pheromone-sensitive neurons responded to the plant odour. Most neurons responded to the pheromone with a multiphasic pattern and were anatomically identified as projection neurons. They responded either with excitation or pure inhibition to heptanal, and the response to the mixture pheromone + heptanal was generally weaker than to the pheromone alone, showing a suppressive effect of heptanal. However, these neurons responded with a better resolution to pulsed stimuli. The other neurons with either purely excitatory or inhibitory responses to all three stimuli did not exhibit significant differences in responses between stimuli. Although the suppression of the pheromone responses in AL neurons by the plant odour is counter-intuitive at first glance, the observed better resolution of pulsed stimuli is probably more important than high sensitivity to the localization of a calling female.},

Odour from twigs of Pinus sylvestris laden with egg masses of the pine sawfly Diprion pini attracts the eulophid egg parasitoid Chrysonotomyia ruforum. Volatiles released from pine twigs without diprionid eggs are not attractive. Oviposition by the sawfly onto pine needles induces not only a local response in pine needles laden with eggs but also a systemic reaction. Needles without eggs but adjacent to those bearing diprionid eggs also release the volatiles that attract the egg parasitoid. The elicitor of the attractive volatiles was shown to be present in the oviduct secretion coating the eggs of A pini. When pine twigs are treated with jasmonic acid, a well-known plant wound signal, they emit volatiles that attract the egg parasitoid. These results show, for the first time, that a gymnosperm plant is able to attract parasitoids as soon as a herbivore has deposited its eggs on it. Thus, the plant appears to defend itself against herbivores prior to being damaged by feeding larvae.},

In this study, we identified the volatiles emitted by maize plants undamaged and damaged by S. frugiperda larvae that were attractive to virgin C. insularis females. In a Y-glass tube olfactometer, parasitoid females were more attracted to activated charcoal extracts than Porapak Q maize extracts. Chemical analysis of activated charcoal extracts from maize plants damaged by S. frugiperda larvae by gas chromatography coupled with electroantennography (GC-EAD) showed that the antennae of virgin female wasps consistently responded to three compounds, identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as alpha-pinene, alpha-longipinene and alpha-copaene. These compounds are constitutively released by maize plants but induction via herbivory affects their emissions. alpha-Longipinene and alpha-copaene were more abundant in damaged maize plants than in healthy ones, whereas alpha-pinene was produced in higher amounts in healthy maize plants than in damaged ones. Female parasitoids were not attracted to EAD-active compounds when evaluated singly; however, they were attracted to the binary blend alpha-pinene + alpha-copaene, which was the most attractive blend, even more attractive than the tertiary blend (alpha-pinene + alpha-longipinene + alpha-copaene) and the damaged maize plant extracts. We conclude that C. insularis is attracted to a blend of herbivore-induced volatiles emitted by maize plants.},

It has been speculated that most insects represent mobile microhabitats in which nematodes can obtain food, mobility, and shelter. Nematode-insect associations can be classified as phoretic (insects used for transportation, not as food), necromenic (insect used for transportation, then carcass as food), and entomopathogenic (insect is killed and used as food). To determine how nematodes target their hosts, we analyzed the chemosensory response and behavioral parameters of closely related Pristionchus nematodes that form species-specific necromenic associations with scarab beetles and the Colorado potato beetle [1, 2]. We found that all four studied Pristionchus species displayed unique chemoattractive profiles toward insect pheromones and plant volatiles with links to Pristionchus habitats. Moreover, chemoattraction in P. pacificus differs from that of C. elegans not only in the types of attractants, but also in its tempo, mode, and concentration response range. We conclude that Pristionchus olfaction is highly diverse among closely related species and is likely to be involved in shaping nematode-host interactions.},

In modified "walking wind tunnels," virgin females were most attracted to the alcohol component, and virgin males were repelled by the pheromone blend at the lowest and highest amounts offered. Y-tube olfactometer bioassays also showed that females were significantly more attracted to the pheromone and its components than males were. However, males were more attracted to plant volatiles than females. Of 12 plant volatiles tested, delta-3-carene and (E)-caryophyliene were highly attractive to males, whereas (Z) -3-hexenyl acetate was repellent to males. Combining the male pheromone blend with (-)-linalool alone or with (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol attracted significantly more males than did the pheromone alone. We tested four trap designs in our quarantine greenhouse with eight different lures. The Intercept Panel traps and the hand-made screen sleeve traps caught more beetles than the Plum Curculio traps and Lindgren funnel traps. Intercept traps worked best when baited with male blend and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, whereas screen sleeve traps were most attractive when baited with (-) -linalool. Our findings provide evidence of the attractiveness of the A. glabripennis male-produced pheromone and suggest that it has a role in mate-finding. It is also a first step toward the development of an efficient trap design and lure combination to monitor A. glabripennis infestations in the field.},

We therefore investigated, under both laboratory and greenhouse conditions, the priming of defense responses in plants (lima bean and corn) by exposing them to transgenic-plant-volatiles (VOCos) including (E)-beta-ocimene, emitted from transgenic tobacco plants (NtOS2) that were constitutively overexpressing (E)-beta-ocimene synthase. When lima bean plants that had previously been placed downwind of NtOS2 in an open-flow tunnel were infested by spider mites, they were more defensive to spider mites and more attractive to predatory mites, in comparison to the infested plants that had been placed downwind of wild-type tobacco plants. This was similarly observed when the NtOS2-downwind maize plants were infested with Mythimna separata larvae, resulting in reduced larval growth and greater attraction of parasitic wasps (Cotesia kariyai). In a greenhouse experiment, we also found that lima bean plants (VOCos-receiver plants) placed near NtOS2 were more attractive when damaged by spider mites, in comparison to the infested plants that had been placed near the wild-type plants. More intriguingly, VOCs emitted from infested VOCos-receiver plants affected their conspecific neighboring plants to prime indirect defenses in response to herbivory. Altogether, these data suggest that transgenic-plant- emitted volatiles can enhance the ability to prime indirect defenses via both plant-plant and plant-plant-plant communications.},

Our study using five pheromone-related compounds and 42 plant volatile compounds indicates that S. discoideus have highly specialized ORNs for pheromone and plant volatile compounds. Different groups of ORNs present in both males and females of S. discoideus were highly sensitive to 4-methylheptane-3,5-dione (diketone) and four isomers (RR, RS, SR and SS) of 5-hydroxy-4-methylheptan-3-one, respectively. Our results also indicate that male S. discoideus, using the sensory input from antennal ORNs, can distinguish both diketone and the RR-isomer from others, and RS- and SS-isomers from others, although it was unclear if they can distinguish between RS-isomer and SS-isomer, or between diketone and the SR-isomer. It also appeared that female S. discoideus could distinguish between RS-isomer and SS-isomers. The antennae of S. discoideus thus contain sex-specific sets of ORNs for host- and non-host plant volatile compounds. Both sexes of S. discoideus have highly sensitive and selective ORNs for some green-leaf volatiles, such as (Z)-3-hexenol and (E)-2-hexenal. In contrast, male antennae of S. discoideus house three distinct groups of ORNs specialized for myrcene and (E)-beta-ocimene, 2-phenylethanol, and phenylacetaldehyde, respectively, whereas female antennae contain three groups of ORNs specialized for (+/-)-linalool and (+/-)-alpha-terpineol, myrcene and (E)-beta-ocimene, (+/-)-1-octen-3-ol, and 3-octanone. Our results suggest that S. discoideus use a multi-component pheromone communication system, and a sex-specific set of ORNs with a narrow range of response spectra for host-plant location.},

	abstract = {BackgroundThe oriental fruit moth Grapholita molesta is a host-switching pest species. The adults highly depend on olfactory cues in locating optimal host plants and oviposition sites. Odorant binding proteins (OBPs) are thought to be responsible for recognizing and transporting hydrophobic odorants across the aqueous sensillum lymph to stimulate the odorant receptors (ORs) within the antennal sensilla and activate the olfactory signal transduction pathway. Exploring the physiological function of these OBPs could facilitate understanding insect chemical communications.Methodology/Principal FindingTwo antennae-specific general OBPs (GOBPs) of G. molesta were expressed and purified in vitro. The binding affinities of G. molesta GOBP1 and 2 (GmolGOBP1 and 2) for sex pheromone components and host plant volatiles were measured by fluorescence ligand-binding assays. The distribution of GmolGOBP1 and 2 in the antennal sensillum were defined by whole mount fluorescence immunohistochemistry (WM-FIHC) experiments. The binding sites of GmolGOBP2 were predicted using homology modeling, molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis. Both GmolGOBP1 and 2 are housing in sensilla basiconica and with no differences in male and female antennae. Recombinant GmolGOBP1 (rGmolGOBP1) exhibited broad binding properties towards host plant volatiles and sex pheromone components; rGmolGOBP2 could not effectively bind host plant volatiles but showed specific binding affinity with a minor sex pheromone component dodecanol. We chose GmolGOBP2 and dodecanol for further homology modeling, molecular docking, and site-directed mutagenesis. Binding affinities of mutants demonstrated that Thr9 was the key binding site and confirmed dodecanol bonding to protein involves a hydrogen bond. Combined with the pH effect on binding affinities of rGmolGOBP2, ligand binding and release of GmolGOBP2 were related to a pH-dependent conformational transition.ConclusionTwo rGmolGOBPs exhibit different binding characteristics for tested ligands. rGmolGOBP1 has dual functions in recognition of host plant volatiles and sex pheromone components, while rGmolGOBP2 is mainly involved in minor sex pheromone component dodecanol perception. This study also provides empirical evidence for the predicted functions of key amino acids in recombinant protein ligand-binding characteristics. Copyright: CC BY},

Much less known, however, is the phenomenon that genotypes of the same host plant species vary in the attractiveness of these induced chemical signals, whereas they also differ in characteristics that affect the predator's foraging success, such as leaf pubescence. In a series of two-choice experiments (using a Y-tube olfactometer) we determined the preference of Typhlodromalus aripo for pubescent versus glabrous cassava cultivars infested with the cassava green mite Mononychellus tanajoa and also the preference for cultivars within each of the two groups. We found that when offered a choice between pubescent and glabrous cassava cultivars (either apex or leaves), T. aripo was significantly more attracted to pubescent cultivars. For each cultivar, M. tanajoa infested leaves and apices were equally attractive to T. aripo. There was however some variation in the response of T. aripo to M. tanajoa-infested plant parts within the group of pubescent cultivars, as well as within the group of glabrous cultivars. Our study confirms not only that T. aripo uses herbivore-induced plant volatiles to search for prey in cassava fields, but it also shows that it can discriminate between glabrous and pubescent cultivars and prefers the latter. This knowledge can be useful in selecting cultivars that are attractive and suitable to T. aripo, which, in turn, may promote biological control of the cassava green mite.},

These herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) can attract carnivorous natural enemies of the herbivores, such as parasitoids and predators, a phenomenon that is called indirect plant defense. The volatile blends of infested plants can be very complex, sometimes consisting of hundreds of compounds. Most HIPVs can be classified as terpenoids (e.g., (E)-beta-ocimene, (E,E)-alpha-farnesene, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene), green leaf volatiles (e.g., hexanal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate), phenylpropanoids (e.g., methyl salicylate, indole), and sulphur- or nitrogen-containing compounds (e.g., isothiocyanates or nitrites, respectively). One highly intriguing question has been which volatiles out of the complex blend are the most important ones for the carnivorous natural enemies to locate ?suitable host plants. Here, we review the methods and techniques that have been used to elucidate the carnivore-attracting compounds. Electrophysiological methods such as electroantennography have been used with parasitoids to elucidate which compounds can be perceived by the antennae. Different types of elicitors and inhibitors have widely been applied to manipulate plant volatile blends. Furthermore, transgenic plants that were genetically modified in specific steps in one of the signal transduction pathways or biosynthetic routes have been used to find steps in HIPV emission crucial for indirect plant defense. Furthermore, we provide an overview on biotic and abiotic factors that influence the emission of HIPVs and how this can affect the interactions between members of different trophic levels. Consequently, we review the progress that has been made in this exciting research field during the past 30 years since the first studies on HIPVs emerged and we highlight important issues to be addressed in the future.},

	abstract = {Induced volatiles provide a signal to foraging predatory insects about the location of their prey. In Iowa, early in the growing season of soybean, Glycine max, many predacious seven-spotted lady beetles, Coccinella septempunctata, were observed on plants with heavy infestations of soybean aphid, Aphis glycines. We studied whether the attraction of this beetle is caused by the release of specific volatile compounds of soybean plants infested by aphids. Volatile compounds emitted by soybean plants infested by aphids were compared with those of undamaged, uninfested, and artificially damaged plants. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses revealed consistent differences in the profiles of volatile compounds between aphid-infested soybean plants and undamaged ones. Significantly more methyl salicylate was released from infested plants at both the V1 and V2 plant growth stages. However, release patterns of two other induced plant volatiles, D-limonene and (E,E)-alpha-farnesene, differed between the two plant growth stages. Gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection of volatile extracts from infested soybean plants showed that methyl salicylate elicited significant electrophysiological responses in C. septempunctata. In field tests, traps baited with methyl salicylate were highly attractive to adult C. septempunctata, whereas 2-phenylethanol was most attractive to the lacewing Chrysoperla carnea and syrphid flies. Another common lady beetle, the multicolored Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis, showed no preference for the compounds. These results indicate that C. septempunctata may use methyl salicylate as the olfactory cue for prey location. We also tested the attractiveness of some selected soybean volatiles to alate soybean aphids in the field, and results showed that traps baited with benzaldehyde caught significantly higher numbers of aphids.},

Macrolophus pygmaeus (Rambur) [Heteroptera: Miridae] is a generalist predatory insect widely used to control the tomato leaf miner, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) [Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae]. Based on a previous study demonstrating the ability of this mirid species to discriminate non-infested versus T. absoluta-infested tomato plants, our objective was to identify plant volatile chemicals (herbivore-induced plant volatiles-HIPVs) guiding the behaviour of such a generalist predator towards its prey. First, we used coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-electroantennographic detection analysis to screen for active antenna components from the volatile blend released by T. absoluta-infested tomato plants. Dose responses associated with each isolated HIPV were also performed using an electroantennograph. Subsequently, behavioural assays were conducted in a double-choice olfactometer to analyse and identify the behaviourally active chemicals eliciting olfactory responses. Twenty-one total compounds induced antennal responses and six of the 21 evoked positive attractions in M. pygmaeus: (E)hex-2-enal, 2-carene, alpha-pinene, beta-phellandrene, hexanal, and linalool. A synthetic blend of active HIPVs induced olfactory responses as well as attraction in the bioassays. Our results provided evidence the generalist mirid predator M. pygmaeus uses chemical cues from infested tomato plants to identify plants infested by prey. We discussed how these results can be used to improve existing biological approaches to control the tomato leaf miner, T. absoluta.},

Previous studies have demonstrated that they identify and select volatile organic compounds, being able to track essential oils of their preferred fruits. However, the specific role played by different compounds in this attraction is largely unknown. Here, we used chromatographic analysis and attraction trials to investigate the molecular basis of foraging in two Neotropical bat species. Both were able to discriminate two classes of compounds, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. We suggest that the first class provide the initial signal as they are released only in early stages and the second group is formed by less volatile compounds released in later stages and responsible for maintaining bat interest even in the absence of monoterpenes. These findings provide a unique molecular perspective for this mutualistic interaction with important implications in forest restoration. Specifically, simple mixtures of commercially available terpenes could act as attractants to seed-dispersing bats into degraded landscapes. (C) 2018 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

Here we explored whether this concept applies to web-building spiders in a multi-trophic context. If a spider were to build her web next to herbivore-fed-on plants that signal the herbivores' enemies for help by emitting herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), that spider may maximize web captures in the short term. However, she would also risk predation by generalist predators that "listen" to signaling plants to find both herbivore and spider prey, likely resulting in lower overall reproductive fitness for the spider. We tested the hypothesis that HIPVs trigger avoidance responses by web-building spiders. We selected seven common HIPVs and one HIPV elicitor, and in two-choice olfactometer bioassays tested their effect on four synanthropic spider species (false black widow, Steatoda grossa; common cellar spider, Pholcus phalangioides; hobo spider, Eratigena agrestis; western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus). The 8-component HIPV/HIPV elicitor blend had a weak deterrent effect on S. grossa, but the effect did not extend to P. phalangioides, E. agrestis, and L. hesperus. Our findings imply that there was insufficient selection pressure for these spiders to recognize HIPVs in a multi-trophic context, where spiders themselves could become prey if generalist predators or spider-hunting parasitoid wasps were to respond to signaling plants.},

Because of its serious resistance to pesticides, an alternative control of CPB is desperately needed. In order to develop an effective attractant for trapping CPB, the behavioral responses of CPB to seven plant-derived volatiles, eight odorous blends, and CPB aggregation pheromone were tested by the Y-tube olfactometer. Field trapping was further conducted based on the results of laboratory behavioral bioassays. The results of laboratory behavioral bioassays showed that 2-phenylethanol was attractive to both sexes. While male beetles were strongly attracted to a three-component blend [comprised of (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate + linalool + methyl salicylate] (81.67\%), females showed low attraction (63.33\%). The addition of aggregation pheromone to the three-component blend increased the attraction percentage of both male (88.33\%) and female beetles (83.33\%), and reduced the difference between the responses of sexes. The results of field tests indicated that the combination of the pheromone and the blend of three-component plant volatiles exhibited the highest attraction to CPB in the field. So these results provide a basis for the use of the pheromone and plant volatiles as a component of forecast and control of the CPB.},

Field elms (Ulmus minor Miller (Ulmaceae)) release a blend of volatiles in response to oviposition of the elm leaf beetle, Xanthogaleruca luteola Muller (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), a major urban and forest pest in the USA and Australia. This induced blend attracts the beneficial egg parasitoid Oomyzus gallerucae Fonscolombe (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae). Our olfactory assays showed that an odorous background of non-attractive host plant volatiles from feeding damaged elms or (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate masks the attractive effect of the host-induced (E)-beta-caryophyllene to O. gallerucae. Quantitative GC-MS analyses revealed decreased concentrations of (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate accompanied by highly increased concentrations of sesquiterpenes in oviposition and feeding treated elms compared to undamaged elms. This finding hints to how the parasitoid might distinguish between different odorous backgrounds. It is corroborated by the outcome of our field study in natural elm stands, where the egg parasitoid parasitized more host egg masses due to an artificially induced blend of elm terpenoids.},

We tested the hypothesis that herbivore-specific HIPVs prime neighboring plants to induce defenses specific to the priming herbivore. Since Manduca sexta (specialist) and Heliothis virescens (generalist) herbivory induced unique HIPV profiles in Nicotiana benthamiana, we used these HIPVs to prime receiver plants for defense responses to simulated herbivory (mechanical wounding and herbivore regurgitant application). Jasmonic acid (JA) accumulations and emitted volatile profiles were monitored as representative defense responses since JA is the major plant hormone involved in wound and defense signaling and HIPVs have been implicated as signals in tritrophic interactions. Herbivore species-specific HIPVs primed neighboring plants, which produced 2 to 4 times more volatiles and JA after simulated herbivory when compared to similarly treated constitutive volatile-exposed plants. However, HIPV-exposed plants accumulated similar amounts of volatiles and JA independent of the combination of priming or challenging herbivore. Furthermore, volatile profiles emitted by primed plants depended only on the challenging herbivore species but not on the species-specific HIPV profile of damaged emitter plants. This suggests that feeding by either herbivore species primed neighboring plants for increased HIPV emissions specific to the subsequently attacking herbivore and is probably controlled by JA.},

	abstract = {Herbivorous and carnivorous arthropods use plant volatiles when foraging for food. In response to herbivory, plants emit a blend that may be quantitatively and qualitatively different from the blend emitted when intact. This induced volatile blend alters the interactions of the plant with its environment. We review recent developments regarding the induction mechanism as well as the ecological consequences in a multitrophic and evolutionary context. It has been well established that carnivores (predators and parasitoids) are attracted by the volatiles induced by their herbivorous victims. This concerns an active plant response. In the case of attraction of predators, this is likely to result in a fitness benefit to the plant, because through consumption a predator removes the herbivores from the plant. However, the benefit to the plant is less clear when parasitoids are attracted, because parasitisation does usually not result in an instantaneous or in a complete termination of consumption by the herbivore. Recently, empirical evidence has been obtained that shows that the plant's response can increase plant fitness, in terms of seed production, due to a reduced consumption rate of parasitized herbivores. However, apart from a benefit from attracting carnivores, the induced volatiles can have a serious cost because there is an increasing number of studies that show that herbivores can be attracted. However, this does not necessarily result in settlement of the herbivores on the emitting plant. The presence of cues from herbivores and/or carnivores that indicate that the plant is a competitor- and/or enemy-dense space, may lead to an avoidance response. Thus, the benefit of emission of induced volatiles is likely to depend on the prevailing faunal composition. Whether plants can adjust their response and influence the emission of the induced volatiles, taking the prevalent environmental conditions into account, is an interesting question that needs to be addressed. The induced volatiles may also affect interactions of the emitting plant with its neighbours, e.g., through altered competitive ability or by the neighbour exploiting the emitted information. Major questions to be addressed in this research field comprise mechanistic aspects, such as the identification of the minimally effective blend of volatiles that explains the attraction of carnivores to herbivore-infested plants, and evolutionary aspects such as the fitness consequences of induced volatiles. The elucidation of mechanistic aspects is important for addressing ecological and evolutionary questions. For instance, an important tool to address ecological and evolutionary aspects would be to have plant pairs that differ in only a single trait. Such plants are likely to become available in the near future as a result of mechanistic studies on signal-transduction pathways and an increased interest in molecular genetics.},

It has been suggested that the rate at which the integration of information becomes manifest as a change in behaviour, differs between categories of natural enemies (parasitoids versus insect predators; specialist versus generalist predators).

	abstract = {Harvestmen (Arachnida, Opiliones) are arachnids that rely on chemicals for communication and are particularly dependent on high humidity. The harvestman Jussara spec. (Sclerosomatidae) clearly prefers to rest on the stem and leaves of Psychotria suterella Muell. Arg. (Rubiaceae), a plant having a complex architecture of overlapping branches. So far, few studies have focused on understanding how harvestmen find their host plant and the benefits associated with the selected plant. Here, we investigated cues harvestmen may exploit to find P.suterella and the potential benefits for harvestmen of this interaction. To address how harvestmen find the plant, we tested two non-exclusive hypotheses: harvestmen use chemicals from conspecifics, and/or harvestmen use chemicals from plants. For the first hypothesis, we assessed the number of harvestmen choosing P.suterella with or without chemicals of Jussara spec. on the main stem. We did not find evidence that Jussara spec. uses chemicals from conspecifics to select P.suterella, at least in isolation, without any mechanical stimuli such as stem texture or size. For the second hypothesis, we tested harvestman behavior exposed to volatiles from P.suterella, a non-preferred host plant - Impatiens walleriana Hook.f. (Balsaminaceae) - and a blank treatment, both in a triangular arena and in a Y-tube olfactometer. We also found no evidence that the harvestmen use plant volatiles to find it. We also tested two non-exclusive hypotheses regarding the benefits of selecting P.suterella for harvestmen. The first hypothesis is that P.suterella offers a higher humidity than other plants in the micro-environment surrounding the leaves because of a high leaf transpiration rate. Harvestmen could benefit from this because they rest with the body in contact with the leaf or at less than 5mm from it. We did not find evidence that leaf transpiration rate is important for Jussara spec., as P.suterella did not present high rates compared to other local species. The second hypothesis is that the leaves of P.suterella provide a better shadow than other plants, acting as a sun shade due to its complex architecture with overlapping leaves. We measured light passage through the leaves of P.suterella and three other local species and found that less light passes through the leaves of P.suterella, which therefore provides darker shadow. This potentially provides a favorable micro-climate for harvestmen, which might help to explain the micro-habitat preference of Jussara spec.},

The odor of uninfested cassava plants was not more attractive than clean air. Dual-choice tests revealed that mealybug-infested plants were preferred to mealybugs alone and mealybug-damaged plants and were the major sources of volatiles that attract females coccinellids to the microhabitat of its prey. The emission of volatile chemicals did not appear to be limited to the infested parts of the plant but did occur systemically throughout the plant. The presence of conspecific coccinellid larvae or adult males did not modify the attractiveness of the mealybug-infested plants. However, when an infested plant with conspecific predator females (alone or with conspecific males) was compared to an infested plant or infested plant with conspecific males, E. flaviventris females showed a preference for the last two sources of odor. The uninfested plant with conspecific males was also preferred to the uninfested plant with conspecific females. In addition, the odor of conspecific males was preferred over that of conspecific females. Female predators preferred the plant infested with unparasitized mealybugs over the plant infested with mealybugs previously parasitized. These results showed that E. flaviventris females use herbivore-induced plant volatiles during foraging and can detect via olfaction the presence of conspecific gravid females and parasitized prey, thus assessing patch suitability from a distance.},

	abstract = {We performed single-sensillum recordings from male and female antennae of the Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis, that included as stimuli the two components of this species' aggregation-sex pheromone in addition to various general odorants. We compared the aggregation-sex-pheromone-component responses of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) to those of OSNs that responded to a variety of plant-related odorants. In the smooth-tipped, tapered, trichoid sensilla on the most distal antennal flagellomeres nos. 10 or 11 of both males and females, we found OSNs with high-amplitude action potentials that were tuned to the aldehyde and alcohol pheromone components and that did not respond to various plant-related volatiles. Because this OSN type responded to both the alcohol and aldehyde components it cannot be considered to be specifically tuned to either component. These large-spiking OSNs were co-compartmentalized in these sensilla with a second, smaller-spiking OSN responding to plant-related volatiles such as geraniol, citronellal, limonene, 1-octanol, nerol and citral. The large-spiking OSNs thus appear to be a type that will be involved in aggregation-sex pheromone pathways targeting a specific glomerulus in the antennal lobe and in generating pheromone-related behavioral responses in A. glabripennis. In other sensilla located in these distal antennal flagellomeres as well as those located more proximally, i.e., mid-length along the antenna on flagellomere nos. 4-7, we found OSNs in blunt-tipped basiconic sensilla that were responsive to other plant-related volatiles, especially the terpenoids, (E,E)-alpha farnesene, (E)-beta-farnesene, beta-caryophyllene, and eugenol. Some of these terpenoids have been implicated in improving attraction to pheromone-baited traps. Some of these same OSNs responded additionally to either of the two sex pheromone components, but because these OSNs also responded to some of the above plant volatiles as shown by cross-adaptation experiments, these OSNs will not be the types that convey sex-pheromone-specific information to the antennal lobe.},

The mated male was attracted to aphids (30.0\%) more than other tested predatory types, indicating the capacity to exploit volatiles induced by aphids.

The cues for attraction are often complex mixtures of herbivore-induced plant volatiles, making it difficult to demonstrate the role of specific compounds. After herbivory by lepidopteran larvae, maize releases a mixture of volatiles that is highly attractive to females of various parasitic wasp species. We identified the terpene synthase TPS10 that forms (E)-beta-farnesene, (E)-alpha-bergamotene, and other herbivory-induced sesquiterpene hydrocarbons from the substrate farnesyl diphosphate. The corresponding gene is expressed in response to herbivore attack and is regulated at the transcript level. Overexpression of tps10 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in plants emitting high quantities of TPS10 sesquiterpene products identical to those released by maize. Using these transgenic Arabidopsis plants as odor sources in olfactometer assays showed that females of the parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris learn to exploit the TPS10 sesquiterpenes to locate their lepidopteran hosts after prior exposure to these volatiles in association with hosts. This dissection of the herbivore-induced volatile blend demonstrates that a single gene such as tps10 can be sufficient to mediate the indirect defense of maize against herbivore attack.},

Most lepidopterans appear to be induced to oviposit in response to a single host-specific compound, while extreme synergism of multiple components features the stimulatory system of oviposition enacted by some butterflies. Recent investigations clearly demonstrate that acceptance or rejection of a particular plant by females is regulated not only by the presence or absence of oviposition stimulants but by negative stimuli evoked by co-occurring deterrents.

The apple fruit moth, Argyresthia conjugella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Argyresthiidae), is a particularly suitable species to study the cues and behavioural mechanisms leading to colonization of a new host: it recurrently oviposits on the non-host plant, apple Malus domestica Borkh. (Rosaceae), where the larvae cannot complete their development. The larval host of the apple fruit moth (Lepidoptera, Argyresthiidae), is rowan Sorbus aucuparia L. (Rosaceae). Fruit setting in rowan, however, fluctuates strongly over large areas in Scandinavia. Every 2-4 years, when too few rowanberries are available for egg laying in forests, apple fruit moth females oviposit instead on apple in nearby orchards, but not on other fruits, such as pear or plum. This poses the question of which cues mediate attraction to rowan and apple, and how apple fruit moth discriminates rowan from apple. Chemical analysis and antennal recordings showed that 11 out of 15 rowan volatiles eliciting an antennal response in A. conjugella females co-occur in rowan and apple headspace, in a different proportion. In the field, A. conjugella was attracted to several of these plant volatiles, especially to 2-phenyl ethanol, methyl salicylate, and decanal. Addition of anethole to 2-phenyl ethanol had a strong synergistic effect, the 1 : 1 blend is a powerful attractant for A. conjugella males and females. These results confirm that volatiles common to both plants may account for a host switch in A. conjugella from rowan to apple. Some of the most attractive compounds, including 2-phenyl ethanol, anethole, and decanal, which have been found in several apple cultivars, were not present in the headspace of the apple cultivar, Aroma, which is also susceptible to attack by A. conjugella. This supports the idea that the odour signal from apple is suboptimal for attraction of A. conjugella, but is nonetheless sufficient for attraction, during times when rowan is not available for egg laying.},

No p-anisaldehyde was found in extractions of body parts ofC. ciliata.Methyl p-anisate and p-methoxybenzoic acid were identified exclusively in the extract from abdominal segments 2-8 of males. Field-trapping experiments revealed no attraction ofC. ciliatato either methyl p-anisate or p-methoxybenzoic acid. In contrast, males showed marked attraction to p-anisaldehyde in the field and antennae showed strong responses to this compound. Headspace collections in the field from living insects in their natural environment and during their main daily activity period indicated that p-anisaldehyde was emitted exclusively byC. ciliatamales. Our overall results suggest that p-anisaldehyde might serve as a male-produced pheromone that attracts conspecificC. ciliatamales. Here, we discuss hypotheses regarding possible mechanisms involved in regulation of p-anisaldehyde production, including involvement of the compounds methyl p-anisate and p-methoxybenzoic acid, and the potential ecological function of p-anisaldehyde inC. ciliata.},

	abstract = {When plants are damaged, they produce semiochemicals which can act as repellents for herbivorous pests and as attractants for organisms antagonistic to these pests, e.g., predators and parasitic wasps. Plants can also produce signals that warn other plants of impending attack. From this range of phenomena, it is possible to identify new ways to control pests. Although, in the past, we have needed to deploy such approaches by applying slow-release formulations of semiochemicals to crop plants, we can now use the plants themselves as a source of these semiochemicals. This may be achieved by using inducing agents, or a new range of natural product plant activators, to 'switch on' plant defence prior to attack. This paper considers the identification of new plant activators. In addition, practical use of plants releasing semiochemicals to ward off pest attack, to ensnare the attackers, and to attract beneficial insects that will attack the pests, is demonstrated by use of the stimulo-deterrent diversionary ('push-pull') strategy that has been developed for management of stem-borer moths in Africa.},

Repeated-measures experiments in laboratory bioassays indicated that wild grape leaf disks damaged and treated with beetle regurgitant were no more attractive than unaltered or artificially damaged disks; however, the treatments that had been fed upon first attracted significantly more beetles than those that bad been fed upon subsequently. Beetles were never observed ''callings'', and scanning electron microscopy did not reveal cuticle pores as in some scarabs.

	abstract = {Herbivorous and carnivorous arthropods use plant volatiles when foraging for food. In response to herbivory, plants emit a blend that may be quantitatively and qualitatively different from the blend emitted when intact. This induced volatile blend alters the interactions of the plant with its environment. We review recent developments regarding the induction mechanism as well as the ecological consequences in a multitrophic and evolutionary context. It has been well established that carnivores (predators and parasitoids) are attracted by the volatiles induced by their herbivorous victims. This concerns an active plant response. In the case of attraction of predators, this is likely to result in a fitness benefit to the plant, because through consumption a predator removes the herbivores from the plant. However, the benefit to the plant is less clear when parasitoids are attracted, because parasitisation does usually not result in an instantaneous or in a complete termination of consumption by the herbivore. Recently, empirical evidence has been obtained that shows that the plant's response can increase plant fitness, in terms of seed production, due to a reduced consumption rate of parasitized herbivores. However, apart from a benefit from attracting carnivores, the induced volatiles can have a serious cost because there is an increasing number of studies that show that herbivores can be attracted. However, this does not necessarily result in settlement of the herbivores on the emitting plant. The presence of cues from herbivores and/or carnivores that indicate that the plant is a competitor- and/or enemy-dense space, may lead to an avoidance response. Thus, the benefit of emission of induced volatiles is likely to depend on the prevailing faunal composition. Whether plants can adjust their response and influence the emission of the induced volatiles, taking the prevalent environmental conditions into account, is an interesting question that needs to be addressed. The induced volatiles may also affect interactions of the emitting plant with its neighbours, e.g., through altered competitive ability or by the neighbour exploiting the emitted information.Major questions to be addressed in this research field comprise mechanistic aspects, such as the identification of the minimally effective blend of volatiles that explains the attraction of carnivores to herbivore-infested plants, and evolutionary aspects such as the fitness consequences of induced volatiles. The elucidation of mechanistic aspects is important for addressing ecological and evolutionary questions. For instance, an important tool to address ecological and evolutionary aspects would be to have plant pairs that differ in only a single trait. Such plants are likely to become available in the near future as a result of mechanistic studies on signal-transduction pathways and an increased interest in molecular genetics.},

We investigated this question in maize plants under attack by Spodoptera littoralis larvae and found that parasitization by the endoparasitoids Cotesia marginiventris and Campoletis sonorensis significantly reduced feeding and weight gain in the host larvae. As a result, young maize plants attacked by a single parasitized larva suffered much less feeding damage and, at maturity, produced about 30\% more seed than plants that were attacked by an unparasitized larva. Such fitness benefits may have contributed to selection pressures that shaped the evolution of herbivore-induced indirect defence signals in plants.},

	abstract = {Parasitoids respond to volatiles that plants produce when injured by herbivores. A considerable body of literature addresses the chemical pathways of herbivore-induced volatile production. However, there is almost no theory or data on how timing of volatile release in relationship to host availability for parasitization impacts the utility of these cues to parasitoids and on the extent that this volatile release timing might increase or decrease the percent of herbivores that become parasitized. This kind of information is critical in judging the benefits that might accrue from a breeding program aimed at enhancing herbivore-responsive volatile production. We developed a general model to begin examining this issue by using available parameters from two tritrophic systems. The model uses herbivore oviposition, development, and mortality rates, linked to a range of plant volatile induction and cessation periods for calculating the proportion of plants in a field that are (1) not producing volatiles but occupied by suitable herbivore hosts, (2) producing volatiles and occupied by suitable herbivore hosts, (3) producing volatiles but not occupied by suitable herbivore hosts, and (4) not producing volatiles and not occupied by suitable herbivore hosts. The impact of the plant volatiles on parasitoid foraging success is then determined by comparing the expected number of hosts parasitized when the parasitoid focuses solely on the volatile-producing plants to when it forages randomly among all plants. Under some conditions, parasitoids can attack three times more herbivores if they focus on volatile-producing plants. However, when we simulate plants that take several days to cease volatile production after pupation or death of the herbivore, parasitization rate does not increase when parasitoids use volatiles as cues. The utility of the volatile cues is consistently greater when a smaller proportion of plants is occupied by herbivores, indicating that their usefulness may be reduced to zero in fields saturated with volatiles.},

Here, we identified the aggregation pheromone of a population of P. striolata from Taiwan, and host plant volatiles that interact with the pheromone. Volatiles emitted by feeding male P. striolata attracted males and females in the field. Headspace volatile analyses revealed that six sesquiterpenes were emitted specifically by feeding males. Only one of these, however, elicited an electrophysiological response from antennae of both sexes. A number of host plant volatiles, e.g., 1-hexanol, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, and the glucosinolate hydrolysis products allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), 3-butenyl isothiocyanate, and 4-pentenyl isothiocyanate also elicited clear responses from the antenna.

The pheromone compound was synthesized starting from (-)-alpha-himachalene isolated from Cedrus atlantica. Under field conditions, the activity of the synthetic pheromone required concomitant presence of the host plant volatile allyl isothiocyanate. However, both synthetic (+)-(6R,7S)-himachala-9,11-diene alone and in combination with AITC were attractive in a two-choice laboratory assay devoid of other natural olfactory stimuli. We hypothesize that P. striolata adults respond to the pheromone only if specific host volatiles are present. In the same laboratory set up, more beetles were attracted by feeding males than by the synthetic stimuli. Thus, further research will be necessary to reveal the components of a more complex blend of host or male-produced semiochemicals that might enhance trap attractiveness in the field.},

Among these organisms, called myrmecophiles, several are butterflies. Here, we explore the amazing diversity of strategies developed by myrmecophilous butterflies to "cheat" or manipulate ants and to elude the tough defenses of the colony. During oviposition, female butterflies use visual or plant volatile signals to identify the presence of ants, whereas chemical and vibroacoustic cues, either isolated or combined, are used by larvae and pupae to attract, deceive, or appease workers. Examples of mimicry and eavesdropping on both intraspecific and interspecific signals are discussed, primarily referring to the obligate-parasitic interactions involving Maculinea butterflies and Myrmica ants. Multimodal communication is crucial to maintaining the strong cohesion and social structure of ant societies, but its corruption is at the base of the evolution and persistence of interspecific associations, which can be beneficial or detrimental for the colony's fitness. In this framework, the remarkable complexity of signaling could have prompted the evolution of specialized life cycles enhancing the extraordinary butterfly diversity.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary Signaling chemicals produced by one organism that bring about a behavioral response in a recipient organism are known as semiochemicals, with pheromones being a well-known example. Semiochemicals have been widely used to monitor and control insect pests in agricultural and forestry settings, but they have not been widely used in weed biological control. Here, we list the few examples of semiochemical use in the practice of classical weed biological control, where a natural enemy (biocontrol agent) from the native range of the plant is introduced into the new invaded range. Uses of semiochemicals include monitoring of biocontrol agents (sex pheromones), keeping biocontrol agents together long enough for them to become well established (aggregation pheromones) and repelling agents from areas where they may be unwanted (host or non-host plant volatile organic deterrents). We make the case that given the vast potential of biological control in suppressing invasive plants it is well worth developing and utilizing semiochemicals to enhance biocontrol programs. In agricultural systems, chemical ecology and the use of semiochemicals have become critical components of integrated pest management. The categories of semiochemicals that have been used include sex pheromones, aggregation pheromones, and plant volatile compounds used as attractants as well as repellents. In contrast, semiochemicals are rarely utilized for management of insects used in weed biological control. Here, we advocate for the benefit of chemical ecology principles in the implementation of weed biocontrol by describing successful utilization of semiochemicals for release, monitoring and manipulation of weed biocontrol agent populations. The potential for more widespread adoption and successful implementation of semiochemicals justifies multidisciplinary collaborations and increased research on how semiochemicals and chemical ecology can enhance weed biocontrol programs.},

Secondary metabolites, which are not essential compounds for plant survival, are involved in the interaction of fleshy fruits with seed dispersers and antagonists. Plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are secondary metabolites that play important roles in biotic interactions and in abiotic stress responses. They are usually accumulated at high levels in specific plant tissues and organs, such as fleshy fruits. The study of VOCs emitted during fruit development and after different biotic challenges may help to determine the interactions of fleshy fruits not only with legitimate vertebrate dispersers, but also with insects and microorganisms. A knowledge of fruit VOCs could be used in agriculture to generate attraction or repellency to pests and resistance to pathogens in fruits. This review provides an examination of specific fruit VOC blends as signals for either seed dispersal or predation through simple or complex trophic chains, which may also have consequences for an understanding of the importance of biodiversity in wild areas.},

Among the pest species, cereal aphids (apterous and alate) were the most prominently affected by CJ treatment, irrespective of the dose; fewer aphids were detected on the CJ-treated plants than on untreated control plants by direct visual counting, sweep net and yellow sticky trap samplings. CJ treatment also had deterrent effects on phytophagous thrips species and wheat stem sawflies (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), whereas CJ was an attractant for aphid parasitoids, coccinellid species and the wheat stem sawfly parasitoid Collyria coxator (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). CJ treatment had no effect on syrphid species (Diptera: Syrphidae). There was no significant effect of CJ treatment on wheat yield; however, CJ-treated plants were taller than untreated control plants.Although the behavioral responses of the studied species to CJ treatment varied with the plant growth stage and treatment dose, and were not consistent across all sampling methods, our findings indicate CJ treatment may be used to reduce some insect pest populations and manipulate some natural enemy species under field conditions.},

Japanese wax scale, Ceroplastes japonicus Green (Hemiptera: Coccoidea: Coccidae), is the most destructive pest in persimmon orchards and is difficult to control using chemical pesticides. This paper studied the variety of volatile emissions from persimmon trees attacked by wax scale or induced by applications of methyl jasmonate (MeJA), an exogenous signaling material. We also studied the role of volatiles in recruiting the ladybeetle, Chilocorus kuwanae Silvestri (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), a primary predator of wax scale. The results showed that the ladybeetles displayed strong taxis responses to the odor sources from trees treated with MeJA and wax scale-damaged trees. Within 24 h after the trees were treated with MeJA, the number of ladybeetles responding to the treated trees fluctuated based on the amount of volatiles released over a diel period. Chemical analysis of the volatiles showed that terpenoid compounds, especially alpha-pinene, increased from both the wax scale-damaged and MeJA-treated trees and that this was the reason for the ladybeetle attraction. Therefore, alpha-pinene was used as a single signal source to examine the taxis response of C. kuwanae. The results suggest that alpha-pinene plays a significant role in attracting the ladybeetles. It is therefore concluded that MeJA application might be used to stimulate the defense function of persimmon trees by inducing the release of terpenoids, especially alpha-pinene, and thereby recruiting more ladybeetles to control the scale insects.},

	abstract = {BackgroundPlant volatiles play an important role in defending plants against insect attacks by attracting their natural enemies. For example, green leaf volatiles (GLVs) and terpenoids emitted from herbivore-damaged plants were found to be important in the host location of parasitic wasps. However, evidence of the functional roles and mechanisms of these semio-chemicals from a system of multiple plants in prey location by the parasitoid is limited. Little is known about the potential evolutionary trends between herbivore-induced host plant volatiles and the host location of their parasitoids.Methodology/Principal FindingsThe present study includes hierarchical cluster analyses of plant volatile profiles from seven families of host and non-host plants of pea leafminer, Liriomyza huidobrensis, and behavioral responses of a naive parasitic wasp, Opius dissitus, to some principal volatile compounds. Here we show that plants can effectively pull wasps, O. dissitus, towards them by releasing a universally induced compound, (Z)-3-hexenol, and potentially keep these plants safe from parasitic assaults by leafminer pests, L. huidobrensis. Specifically, we found that volatile profiles from healthy plants revealed a partly phylogenetic signal, while the inducible compounds of the infested-plants did not result from the fact that the induced plant volatiles dominate most of the volatile blends of the host and non-host plants of the leafminer pests. We further show that the parasitoids are capable of distinguishing the damaged host plant from the non-host plant of the leafminers.Conclusions/SignificanceOur results suggest that, as the most passive scenario of plant involvement, leafminers and mechanical damages evoke similar semio-chemicals. Using ubiquitous compounds, such as hexenol, for host location by general parasitoids could be an adaptation of the most conservative evolution of tritrophic interaction. Although for this, other compounds may be used to improve the precision of the host location by the parasitoids.},

	abstract = {Foraging trails of leaf-cuffing ants may be exposed to plant material that interferes with foragers' flux either by physically blocking it or due to secondary metabolites which affect insect behavior. We hypothesized that plant secondary metabolites such as plant volatiles may interfere with pheromone communication, triggering clearing behavior. We impregnated small pieces of paper with different plant odors from native and exotic species and placed them in the middle of foraging trails of the leaf-cuffing ant Acromyrmex lobicornis. As a control, we used papers impregnated with trail odor. The paper used as substrate for the odors did not constitute a physical obstacle based on its small surface area. Papers treated with trail odor did not interfere with ant flux and were not removed from the trail. However, when papers were treated with plant odors, they were removed from the trail in most of the cases and ant flux was reduced significantly by 15-28\%. We found that ants tapped the tip of their gasser against the ground around the treated papers only when they were impregnated with foreign odors. The number of gasser tappings as well as the time between the placement of the paper and its removal increased with plant odor concentration. However, the decision to remove the paper was not correlated with the number of gasser tappings. Interestingly, clearer ants were smaller than forager ants, suggesting there is morphological differentiation in clearing behavior of the trail. Results from the current study also suggest that odors trigger clearing behavior on foraging trails and affect trail marking behavior. Our results provide information about the potential for plant compounds to constitute obstacles, even when they do not physically obstruct the trail. We conclude that odors may trigger clearing behavior by interfering with pheromone communication.},

OBPs in adult insects have been intensively reported, but those in larvae are rarely addressed. In our study, a full-length OBP cDNA, namely SexiOBP13, was cloned by RT-PCR and RACE strategy from the heads of Spodoptera exigua larvae. The quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) measurement indicated that SexiOBP13 was highly expressed in larval head, but very low in other parts of larva and was not detected in any tissues of adult. The binding affinities of SexiOBP13 to plant volatiles and female sex pheromone components were measured by competitive binding assays. Interestingly, SexiOBP13 displayed a high binding affinity (K-i=3.82 mu mol L-1) to Z9,E12-14:Ac, the major sex pheromone component of S. exigua, while low affinities to the tested host plant volatiles (K-i{\textgreater}27 mu mol L-1). The behavioral tests further confirmed that Z9,E12-14:Ac was indeed active to elicit the behavioral activity of the third instar larvae of S. exigua. Taken together, our results suggest that SexiOBP13 may play a role in reception of female sex pheromone in S. exigua larvae. The ecological significance of the larvae preference to the adult female sex pheromone was discussed.},

The chapter provides an overview of processes that affect the gas balance of plant VOCs in the greenhouse including the loss processes. These processes are considered as important since they contribute to the time-dynamic concentration profiles of plant-emitted VOCs. In addition, we describe the most popular techniques currently in use to measure volatiles emitted from plants, with emphasis on greenhouse application. Dynamic sampling in combination with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry is considered as the most appropriate method for application at greenhouse scale. It is recommended to evaluate the state of the art in the fields concerned with this method and explore the development of a new instrument based on the specific needs for application in greenhouse practice. However, to apply such an instrument at greenhouse-scale remains a challenge, mainly due to the high costs associated with it.},

Plants emit volatiles that serve as signals to host-searching insects and these odours can be altered by both herbivory and fungal endophyte-infection. This study investigated whether ASW adults utilise olfaction to identify their host plants, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), and if conspecific herbivory or the presence of Epichloe festucae var. lolii fungal endophytes (strain wild-type or AR1) influenced such responses. Results from olfactometer bioassays established that ASW adults were able to utilise their olfactory response to orient towards volatiles released by perennial ryegrass and further, the weevils displayed a preference for plants previously damaged by conspecific weevils. However, there was no evidence that weevils had the ability to distinguish between endophyte-infected and endophyte-free plants using olfaction alone. Using a push-pull extraction technique, thirteen volatile compounds were identified in the blend released by perennial ryegrass. Endophyte and herbivory were found to alter these volatile compounds and quantities emitted by this forage grass. This study suggests that despite observing differences in the plant volatile blend, ASW do not perceive endophyte (wild-type and AR1) using olfaction alone and must rely on other cues, e.g. contact chemoreception or post-ingestional malaise, to detect the presence of a bioactive endophyte in an otherwise acceptable host plant.},

We show that host plant volatiles affect the perception of sex pheromone in males of the African cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis and that pheromone and plant volatiles are not perceived as independent messages. In clean air, S. littoralis males are attracted to single synthetic pheromone components or even the pheromone of a sibling species, oriental cotton leafworm S. litura. Presence of host plant volatiles, however, reduces the male response to deficient or heterospecific pheromone signals. That plant cues enhance discrimination of sex pheromone quality confirms the idea that specific mate recognition in noctuid moths has evolved in concert with adaptation to host plants.

	abstract = {Many plant and insect interactions are governed by odors released by the plants or insects and there exists a continual need for new or improved methods to collect and identify these odors. Our group has for some time studied below-ground, plant-produced volatile signals affecting nematode and insect behavior. The research requires repeated sampling of volatiles of intact plant/soil systems in the laboratory as well as the field with the help of probes to minimize unwanted effects on the systems we are studying. After evaluating solid adsorbent filters with solvent extraction or solid phase micro extraction fiber sample collection, we found dynamic sampling of small air volumes on Tenax TA filters followed by thermal desorption sample introduction to be the most suitable analytical technique for our applications. Here we present the development and evaluation of a low-cost and relatively simple thermal desorption technique where a cold trap cooled with liquid carbon dioxide is added as an integral part of a splitless injector. Temperature gradient-based focusing and low thermal mass minimizes aerosol formation and eliminates the need for flash heating, resulting in low sample degradation comparable to solvent-based on-column injections. Additionally, since the presence of the cold trap does not affect normal splitless injections, on-the-fly switching between splitless and thermal desorption modes can be used for external standard quantification.},

However, this functional specificity is not completely conclusive. In the present study, full-length sequences of two new OBP genes were molecularly identified as OachPBP1 and OachGOBP2 from Orthaga achatina, an important pest of the camphor tree Cinnamomum camphora. Quantification of transcript levels by qRT-PCR showed that the two genes highly expressed in antennae, with OachPBP1 male-biased and OachGOBP2 similar between sexes. These expression patterns are consistent with the generally proposed functions of PBPs and GOBPs. With the recombinant proteins obtained by a bacterial expression system, the binding specificity of these proteins was further investigated and compared using the competitive binding assay. OachPBP1 exhibited high binding affinities with all three putative sex pheromones and 10 pheromone analogs, supporting its role in pheromone reception. On the other hand, in addition to binding with some plant volatiles, OachGOBP2 surprisingly displayed similar or even higher binding affinities with the sex pheromones than OachPBP1. Therefore, we propose that OachGOBP2 might play roles in reception of sex pheromone. Additionally, plant volatiles farnesol and farnesene showed high binding with both OachGOBP2 and OachPBP1, suggesting that these volatile chemicals have regulatory functions in the behavior of O. achatina.},

The electroantennographic (EAG) response to substances identified in olive leaves and fruits was studied in virgin and mated adults of different sex and age. In both sexes the EAG response patterns were similar, while EAG amplitudes were different since they were higher in females, particularly on stimulation with aldehydes. Older were the virgin females or males lower was the response, while in mated adults the response was constant. Cluster analysis showed that mated females are able to discern the different odours for a longer period. The persistent olfactory sensitivity and selectivity of mated females might be related to the need of the oviposition site location. In a subsequent field study, D-(+)-limonene and a-pinene showed the higher catch potency, trapping OFF adults in a 1: 1 sex ratio, acting as kairomones. Sampling by single cell recordings (SCR) the antennal olfactory neurons responses, together with cell types stimulated only by the main pheromone component or plant volatile compounds, the presence of highly generalist cells sensitive to substances of both categories came out, with possible inferences in their perception and biological activity. As a consequence, it is necessary to pay great attention when setting up mixed blends of pheromone components and other compounds to monitor or control OFF populations. Researches focused to a practical utilization of the identified kairomones, alone or mixed with other compounds like pheromone and other plant or bacterial volatile compounds, in B. oleae monitoring and control techniques, are still in progress.},

Plant volatiles were significantly induced by herbivory in both healthy and mildew-infected plants, but were quantitatively 41\% lower for mildew-infected plants compared to healthy plants. Parasitoids strongly preferred Pieris-infested plants to dually-infested (Pieris+mildew) plants, and preferred dually infested plants over only mildew-infected plants. The performance of P. brassicae was unaffected by powdery mildew, but C. glomerata cocoon mass was reduced when parasitized caterpillars developed on mildew-infected plants. Thus, avoidance of mildew-infested plants may be adaptive for C. glomerata parasitoids, whereas P. brassicae caterpillars may suffer less parasitism on mildew-infected plants in nature. From a pest management standpoint, the concurrent presence of multiple plant antagonists can affect the efficiency of specific natural enemies, which may in turn have a negative impact on the regulation of pest populations.The co-occurrence of different antagonists on a plant can have multitrophic consequences at the community level. Here we show that infection by a fungal pathogen, the powdery mildew Erysiphe cruciferarum, on Brassica rapa strongly reduces plant volatiles emitted in response to damage by the insect herbivore Pieris brassicae, and reduces plant attractiveness to the main natural enemy of P. brassicae, the parasitic wasp Cotesia glomerata. Herbivore performance was unaffected by the presence of powdery mildew, but parasitoid performance was negatively affected (decreased cocoon mass). From a pest management standpoint, the presence of powdery mildew on Brassica plants may affect the foraging efficiency of natural enemies, which may in turn have a negative impact on the regulation of pest populations.},

We examined this question by comparing the foraging strategies of two parasitoids that differ in their host ranges. In wind-tunnel experiments, we investigated how systemically released herbivore-induced volatiles were used by the generalist parasitoid, Cotesia marginiventris (Cresson) and the specialist, Microplitis croceipes (Cresson). We determined the relative influence of these volatiles as compared to other signals emitted in the host orientation of the two parasitoids. Both the generalist and the specialist parasitoid strongly preferred Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) leaf-induced systemic plants over undamaged plants when no other information was available. When wasps were given a choice between leaf-induced and undamaged plants carrying other plant- or host-related materials, the responses differed for the two species. C. marginiventris appeared to cue primarily on recent damage volatiles, whereas M. croceipes appeared to cue primarily on host frass volatiles. However, recent damage on previously leaf-induced plants, was strongly preferred to recent damage on plants previously damaged by both species. When plants were induced at the squares by Helicoverpa tea (Boddie), only M. croceipes exhibited a preference for these plants over undamaged plants. The adaptive significance of the behaviors as related to dietary specializations of the parasitoids is discussed.},

(Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae), towards volatiles emitted by different host plants and conspecifics was tested in field experiments during the flight period at dusk. Funnel traps containing artificially damaged leaves from the host plants Carpinus betulus L. and Quercus rubra L., as well as from the non-host plant Prunus serotina Ehrh. caught significantly more beetles than empty control traps. On the other hand, traps baited with undamaged leaves from Q. rubra did not catch significantly more beetles than empty control traps. On the other hand, traps baited with undamaged leaves from Q. rubra did not catch significantly more beetles than empty controls. Leaves from C. betulus damaged by beetle feeding did not attract more beetles than artificially damaged leaves. By use of gas chromatography coupled with electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) electrophysiological responses of males and females were shown for Is typical plant volatiles. A synthetic mixture of selected typical green plant volatiles was also highly attractive in the field. A total of 9982 beetles was caught during the field experiments, among them only 33 females. This suggests that attraction to damaged foliage during flight period at dusk is male-specific. Field experiments testing the attractiveness of female M. hippocastani towards conspecific males by employing caged beetles and beetle extracts indicated that males of M. hippocastani use a female-derived sex pheromone for mate location. On wired cages containing either unmated feeding females, or unmated females without access to foliage, or feeding males in combination with extracts from unmated females, significantly more males landed during the flight period than on comparable control cages containing feeding males or male extracts. A possible scenario of mate location in M. hippocastani involving feeding-induced plant volatiles and a female-derived sex pheromone is discussed.},

Compared to unbaited blocks, hop yards baited with controlled release sachet (CRS) dispensers of synthetic MeSA recruited larger (3-5x) populations of spider mite predators: Stethorus spp. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Orius tristicolor (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), Geocoris pollens (Hemiptera: Geocoridae), Deraeocoris brevis (Hemiptera: Miridae), Chrysopidae, Hemerobiidae, Nabidae, Thripidae. The enhanced community of mite predators controlled spider mite populations in MeSA-baited hops without miticide intervention. All unbaited blocks required at least one miticide for spider mite control. Direct application of natural MeSA (oil of wintergreen) to hop plants contained in canola oil or rosemary/peppermint oil pesticide formulations, resulted in greater attraction of two mite predators (O. tristicolor and Stethorus spp.) to treated than to untreated plants. MeSA-mediated stimulation of the plants to produce predator-attracting volatiles is suggested as the likely mechanism. The use of synthetic or natural versions of HIPV/plant-signaling compounds like MeSA as 'Herbivore-Induced Plant Protection Odors' (HIPPOs), has the potential to provide a novel yet practical strategy for improving the efficacy and reliability of conservation biological control of mites in a variety of agricultural ecosystems.},

Recent studies have also shown that birds use olfaction more than previously thought, underlying the potential for HIPVs to be sensed by insectivorous birds and utilised during foraging for prey. The HIPV production in plants is mediated, at least partly, by the jasmonic acid signalling pathway, and similar HIPVs to those induced by herbivores can often be induced by exposing plants to methyl jasmonate (MeJa). We studied the effects of MeJa on volatile emission and bird attraction using mature mountain birches (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) under natural conditions in northern Finland. Experimental trees were assigned to four treatment groups: herbivore-damaged [autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata)], higher dose of MeJa (30 mM), lower dose of MeJa (15 mM) and control. All trees had three branches covered with mesh bags, but there were larvae inside the bags only of the herbivore-damage treatment. Bird predation rate was monitored with artificial plasticine larvae which were checked daily for peck marks. Birds most often pecked the larvae in the herbivore-damaged trees, but the attractiveness of MeJa-treated trees did not differ from the control. High within-treatment variation in systemic HIPV emissions probably masked MeJa treatment effects. The bird predation rate was high in birches that emitted large amounts of alpha-pinene. Thus, alpha-pinene may be one cue used by birds to find herbivore-rich birches.},

In the first flight tunnel experiment, using a previously identified attractive blend with seven common but essential components ("optimized blend''), we found that doubling the amount of six compounds singly [(E)- \& (Z)-linalool oxides, nonanal, decanal, beta-caryophyllene, or germacrene-D], while keeping the concentration of other compounds constant, significantly reduced female attraction (average 76\% full and 59\% partial upwind flight reduction) to the synthetic blends. However, doubling (E)-4,8-dimethyl 1,3,7-nonatriene had no effect on female response. In the second experiment, we manipulated the volatile profile more naturally by exposing clonal grapevines to Japanese beetle feeding. In the flight tunnel, foliar damage significantly reduced female landing on grape shoots by 72\% and full upwind flight by 24\%. The reduction was associated with two changes: (1) more than a two-fold increase in total amount of the seven essential volatile compounds, and (2) changes in their relative ratios. Compared to the optimized blend, synthetic blends mimicking the volatile ratio emitted by damaged grapevines resulted in an average of 87\% and 32\% reduction in full and partial upwind orientation, respectively, and the level of reduction was similar at both high and low doses. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the specificity of a ubiquitous volatile blend is determined, in part, by the ratio of key volatile compounds for this diet specialist. However, P. viteana was also able to accommodate significant variation in the ratio of some compounds as well as the concentration of the overall mixture. Such plasticity may be critical for phytophagous insects to successfully eavesdrop on variable host plant volatile signals.},

	abstract = {Herbivore-induced volatiles are widespread in plants. They can serve as alert signals that enable neighbouring leaves and plants to pre-emptively increase defences and avoid herbivory damage. However, our understanding of the factors mediating volatile organic compound (VOC) signal interpretation by receiver plants and the degree to which multiple herbivores affect VOC signals is still limited. Here we investigated whether plant responses to damage-induced VOC signals were population specific. As a secondary goal, we tested for interference in signal production or reception when plants were subjected to multiple types of herbivore damage. We factorially crossed the population sources of paired Phaseolus lunatus plants (same versus different population sources) with a mechanical damage treatment to one member of the pair (i.e. the VOC emitter, damaged versus control), and we measured herbivore damage to the other plant (the VOC receiver) in the field. Prior to the experiment, both emitter and receiver plants were naturally colonized by aphids, enabling us to test the hypothesis that damage from sap-feeding herbivores interferes with VOC communication by including emitter and receiver aphid abundances as covariates in our analyses. One week after mechanical leaf damage, we removed all the emitter plants from the field and conducted fortnightly surveys of leaf herbivory. We found evidence that receiver plants responded using population-specific 'dialects' where only receivers from the same source population as the damaged emitters suffered less leaf damage upon exposure to the volatile signals. We also found that the abundance of aphids on both emitter and receiver plants did not alter this volatile signalling during both production and reception despite well-documented defence crosstalk within individual plants that are simultaneously attacked by multiple herbivores. Overall, these results show that plant communication is highly sensitive to genetic relatedness between emitter and receiver plants and that communication is resilient to herbivore co-infestation.},

Uninfested plants experience a trade-off between pollinator and spider attraction as both bees and crab spiders are attracted by the floral volatile beta-ocimene. This trade-off is reduced by the induced emission of beta-ocimene after florivore infestation, which is stronger in plant populations where crab spiders are present than where they are absent, suggesting that plants are locally adapted to the presence of crab spiders. Our study demonstrates the context-dependence of selection and shows how crab spiders impact on floral evolution.},

Parasitoids are attracted by these volatiles in a quite specific way. By combining behavioral and chemical studies, we showed bottom-up effects in a broad bean Vicia faba (Fabaceae)-pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Homoptera: Aphididae)-parasitoid Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) model system. We found that behavioral selection of parasitoid females toward plants with a high density of aphid infestation was reduced, and this can be linked to reduced emission of volatile compounds. In practice, if parasitoids are less attracted to plants with high-density aphid infestations, there may be potential negative impacts on biological control.

We tested the impact of infestation density (low, intermediate, and high) of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Homoptera: Aphididae), feeding on the broad bean Vicia faba, on the attractiveness of the parasitoid Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), using a Y-tube olfactometer (infested vs. non-infested plants). The emitted volatile compounds from both infested and non-infested plants were collected and identified. In addition, two series of experiments were carried out to test the impact of the presence of a conspecific female parasitoid within the aphid/plant complex on the attractiveness to other females. Parasitoids were significantly more attracted to the plants with low and intermediate aphid infestation levels. The volatile blend composition of the infested plants changed in relation to aphid density and may explain the low attraction of parasitoids toward high aphid density. The presence of conspecific females on the aphid patch had no apparent impact on the behavioral choices of other parasitoid females. Our study adds a new aspect to understanding plant-aphid-parasitoid interactions, including the possibility that aphids may manipulate chemical cues of host plants affecting the orientation of parasitoids.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Olfaction plays crucial role in mosquito host seeking, oviposition and searching for sugar sources. However, the role of semiochemicals in mating behavior remains speculative. In this paper we summarized the research on mosquito olfaction and chemical ecology in the past 20 years. The olfactory receptors in the sensilla of the antenna, maxillary palps and proboscis respond to the odors from the environment. The olfactory transduction and neural encoding and processing in the peripheral olfactory pathway start from the binding of odorant binding receptors (OBP) with odors. The changes in sensitivity and response profile of olfactory receptor neurons as a result of blood meal are involved in modulating behavior of mosquito females. The carbon dioxide, lactic acid and other odors released from animal and human skins attract mosquito upwind flight to the source in the host seeking. The volatiles from the oviposition site and the pheromone compounds originating from eggs, larvae and pupae have been found attractive to the gravid females. The plant volatiles especially the flower fragrance helps mosquito adults search for sugars. Current repellents act by interfering, directly or indirectly, with olfaction. Some repellents inhibit the mosquito orientation flight by impeding its olfaction. It could be promising to find the active substances in the odors from animals, human skins, plants or oviposition sites. The understanding of the olfactory mechanism can allow us to develop new and effective tools for mosquito surveillance and control.},

This study investigated the timing of reproductive development in female beetles and the influence of female reproductive maturity on attraction to host volatiles. Based on dissections of females of increasing age, females with access to males for mating, and thus presumed mated, developed mature eggs only after 18-24 days. In contrast, female beetles reared without access to males, and thus unmated, did not develop mature eggs at any age. Chemical analysis of cuticular hydrocarbons detected the contact sex pheromone, 9-methyl-pentacosane, in cohorts of females which were 8-9 days old and older, supporting previous research that this compound signals sexual maturity to males. Results from field-trapping bioassays demonstrated that stage of female reproductive maturity influenced their attraction to host volatiles: females caught on traps baited with foliar volatiles contained eggs and ovarioles that were significantly less developed than those on traps baited with bark sesquiterpenes. However, our results revealed that females with immature stages of ovarioles and undeveloped eggs, such as those observed in unmated females, were rarely ever caught on traps baited with either of the host volatile lures. Further research on host compounds attractive to immature females is critical for early detection and possible control of A. planipennis populations during the extended pre-oviposition period.},

In this study, two different methods were used to investigate the effect of plant volatiles and P. neoaphidis-sporulating cadavers on (1) the colonisation of Vicia faba plants by Acyrthosiphon pisum and (2) P. neoaphidis transmission. This study indicates that A. pistan does not avoid bean plants containing P. neoaphidis and that transmission of conidia occurs during plant colonisation and, to a lesser extent, during in situ feeding.

Females exposed to cotton volatiles started calling earlier than females exposed to non-host plant volatiles (NHV), or the blank control. Likewise, moth pairs exposed to cotton volatiles started mating earlier than the other treatments. The period of calling in females alone was longer than females kept with males, having the opportunity to mate. However, the callings, as well as mating durations in the moth pairs, in different treatments were not different. Longevity was decreased either in the absence of cotton or the presence of Av, and spruce leaves. Fecundity was reduced in moths exposed to a combination of spruce and cotton. The effect of NHV on attraction of 2-3-day-old male moths towards a pheromone (Ph) source was studied in a wind tunnel. In the no-choice assay, more males arrived at close approach and landed on the Ph source when the host plant, cotton, was offered in the background as compared to the non-hosts. In the dual-choice assay, more males landed on the Ph source in front of the host plant compared to the Ph source in front of non-hosts.

In the past 10 years it has become known that plants may respond to being damaged by herbivorous arthropods by producing volatiles that attract carnivorous arthropods. These volatiles are different from those emitted in response to mechanical damage and terpenoids are a major class among the herbivore-induced carnivore attractants. Herbivore secretions such as caterpillar regurgitate elicit the plant response. The carnivore-attractants are produced at the site of herbivore damage as well as systemically throughout the plant. An elicitor that is exported from herbivore-infested leaves and induced carnivore-attractant production in uninfested leaves has recently been extracted.Herbivore cues are not very detectable to carnivores at a distance, and herbivore-induced plant volatiles increase herbivore detectability enormously. Moreover, herbivore-induced plant volatiles may also provide carnivores with information about the plant species, the plant cultivar and the herbivore species that infests the plant and thus are more reliable to carnivores than general damage-related plant volatiles. Therefore, herbivore-induced volatiles are an essential information source for carnivores that search for herbivores.},

Under these conditions, tools other than conventional pheromone dispensers are needed for flight monitoring. The objective of the present work was to determine whether plant volatiles synergizemale G. molesta attraction to a suboptimal dose of synthetic sex pheromone. The plant blend (referred to as 5VB), a mixture of three green leaf volatiles [(Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, (Z)-3-hexenol, and (E)-2-hexenal] and two aromatics [benzaldehyde (BZA) and benzonitrile (BZN)], was added to the suboptimal pheromone dose (2 ng on filter paper) in log steps (up to 10 000 x the pheromone dose) to test synergism of pheromone and plant blends. In addition, the effect of individual plant volatiles on male responses was investigated by adding to the suboptimal pheromone dose each of the four-compound plant-volatile blends, resulting from eliminating one volatile from the 5VB at a time, or each plant volatile alone. Flight behaviour and the time to reach the source were recorded. The 5VB alone was not attractive to G. molesta males, but at a ratio of 1: 1 000 (Ph:5VB) or higher, the attractiveness of the suboptimal pheromone dose increased, to a level similar to that of the optimal pheromone dose (10 ng). All tested plant volatiles, except BZA, synergized the response to the pheromone when added individually, but only (Z)-3-hexenol and BZN did so to a level not significantly different from the Ph: 5VB blend. Aromatics had a stronger effect than green leaf volatiles (GLVs), because their removal, but not the removal of GLVs, decreased landing responses. The addition of the 5VB decreased significantly the time males needed to reach the odour source. The observed enhanced male attraction to mixtures of pheromone and plant volatiles will facilitate the development of lures for G. molesta adult flight monitoring.},

	abstract = {Background: The role of herbivore-induced plant volatiles as signals mediating the attraction of herbivore enemies is a well-known phenomenon. Studies with short-lived herbaceous plant species have shown that various biotic and abiotic factors can strongly affect the quantity, composition and timing of volatile emission dynamics. However, there is little knowledge on how these factors influence the volatile emission of long-lived woody perennials. The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal dynamics of herbivore-induced volatile emission of black poplar (Populus nigra) through several day-night cycles following the onset of herbivory. We also determined the influence of different herbivore species, caterpillars of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) and poplar hawkmoth (Laothoe populi), and different herbivore developmental stages on emission.Results: The emission dynamics of major groups of volatile compounds differed strikingly in response to the timing of herbivory and the day-night cycle. The emission of aldoximes, salicyl aldehyde, and to a lesser extent, green leaf volatiles began shortly after herbivore attack and ceased quickly after herbivore removal, irrespective of the day-night cycle. However, the emission of most terpenes showed a more delayed reaction to the start and end of herbivory, and emission was significantly greater during the day compared to the night. The identity of the caterpillar species caused only slight changes in emission, but variation in developmental stage had a strong impact on volatile emission with early instar L. dispar inducing more nitrogenous volatiles and terpenoids than late instar caterpillars of the same species.Conclusions: The results indicate that only a few of the many herbivore-induced black poplar volatiles are released in tight correlation with the timing of herbivory. These may represent the most reliable cues for herbivore enemies and, interestingly, have been shown in a recent study to be the best attractants for an herbivore enemy that parasitizes gypsy moth larvae feeding on black poplar.},

Compared to undamaged control plants, infestation with SWF did not induce volatile emissions or affect the number and density of pigment glands that store volatile and nonvolatile terpenoid compounds, whereas infestation by BAW strongly induced plant volatile emission. When challenged by the two insect herbivores simultaneously, volatile emission was significantly less than for plants infested with only BAW. Our results suggest that tritrophic level interactions between cotton, BAW, and natural enemies of BAW, that are known to be mediated by plant volatile emissions, may be perturbed by simultaneous infestation by SWF. Possible mechanisms by which the presence of whiteflies may attenuate volatile emissions from caterpillar-damaged cotton plants are discussed.},

In corn (Zea mays), this induced odor blend is mainly composed of terpenoids and indole. The induced signal varies with plant species and genotype, but little is known about the variation due to abiotic factors. Here, we tested the effect of soil humidity, air humidity, temperature, light, and fertilization rate on the emission of induced volatiles in young corn plants. Each factor was tested separately under constant conditions for the other factors. Plants released more when standing in dry soil than in wet soil, whereas for air humidity, the optimal release was found at around 60\%, relative humidity. Temperatures between 22degreesC and 27degreesC led to a higher emission than lower or higher temperatures. Light intensity had a dramatic effect. The emission of volatiles did not occur in the dark and increased steadily with an increase in the light intensity. An experiment with an unnatural light-dark cycle showed that the release was fully photophase dependent. Fertilization also had a strong positive effect; the emission of volatiles was minimal when plants were grown under low nutrition, even when results were corrected for plant biomass. Changes in all abiotic factors caused small but significant changes in the relative ratios among the different compounds (quality) in the induced odor blends, except for air humidity. Hence, climatic conditions and nutrient availability can be important factors in determining the intensity and variability in the release of induced plant volatiles.},

Because associations between figs and their pollinating wasps are horizontally transmitted, partner encounter is a crucial step, and is mediated by the emission by receptive figs of the volatile compounds that are detected by the pollinator.

Other likely functions include signalling to wasps that a fig has already been pollinated, and deterring or defending against visitors with negative effects on developing figs or the pollinators they contain. The functions of volatile compounds will also change over the course of fig development, and the composition of the odour bouquet is thus also likely to vary. However, this variation and its likely functional importance have rarely been studied. To address these questions, we investigated changes in the composition of the bouquet of volatile compounds, and in the rate of emission of odour components, before, during and after the phase of receptivity to pollinators in Ficus hispida, in Yunnan (China).

However, due to methodological limitations, no study has previously detected belowground herbivore-induced volatiles in the field or quantified their impact on attraction of diverse EPN species. Here we show how a belowground herbivore-induced volatile can enhance mortality of agriculturally significant root pests. First, in real time, we identified pregeijerene (1,5-dimethylcyclodeca-1,5,7-triene) from citrus roots 9-12 hours after initiation of larval Diaprepes abbreviatus feeding. This compound was also detected in the root zone of mature citrus trees in the field. Application of collected volatiles from weevil-damaged citrus roots attracted native EPNs and increased mortality of beetle larvae (D. abbreviatus) compared to controls in a citrus orchard. In addition, field applications of isolated pregeijerene caused similar results. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that pregeijerene increased pest mortality by attracting four species of naturally occurring EPNs in the field. Finally, we tested the generality of this root-zone signal by application of pregeijerene in blueberry fields; mortality of larvae (Galleria mellonella and Anomala orientalis) again increased by attracting naturally occurring populations of an EPN. Thus, this specific belowground signal attracts natural enemies of widespread root pests in distinct agricultural systems and may have broad potential in biological control of root pests.},

The aim of this study was therefore to describe the mating behavior of C. luridus and the olfactory response of males and females to volatiles of conspecifics alone or conspecifics with a host plant. The mating behavior was observed in newly emerged pairs for 9 days in the laboratory. A Y-tube olfactometer was used to evaluate the responses of beetles to odor sources. The paired adults began to mate 2 days after emergence, and they displayed repeated matings that increased in frequency with age.

In the olfactometer bioassays, the volatiles emitted from males that fed on Duboisia sp. were attractive to conspecific weevils.

Here, we report the identification of a volatile, male-produced aggregation-sex pheromone for this species. Headspace odours from males contained a major male-specific compound, identified as (2 S, 5E)-6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-2-ol (common name (S)-fuscumol), and a minor component (E)-6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-2-one (geranylacetone).

In field trials in its native range in Slovenia, (S)-fuscumol was significantly more attractive to beetles of both sexes, than racemic fuscumol and a blend of host plant volatiles commonly used as an attractant for this species. Fuscumolbaited traps also caught significant numbers of another spondylidine species, Spondylis buprestoides (L.), and a rare click beetle, Stenagostus rufus (De Geer).

Additional experiments revealed significant changes in microbiota composition after forty-eight hours of larval exposure to indole. Overall, these results provide evidence that certain HIPVs can strongly enhance the susceptibility of caterpillars to pathogens, possibly through effects on the insect gut microbiota. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which HIPVs can protect plants from herbivorous insects.IMPORTANCE Multitrophic interactions involving insect pests, their natural enemies, microorganisms, and plant hosts are increasingly being recognized as relevant factors in pest management. In response to herbivory attacks, plants activate a wide range of defenses that aim to mitigate the damage. Attacked plants release herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), which can act as priming signals for other plants and attract natural enemies of herbivores, and which may have a direct negative impact on herbivore survival. In the present work, we show that exposure of the insects to the induced volatiles could increase the insects' susceptibility to the entomopathogens naturally occurring in the plant environment. These findings suggest a novel role for plant volatiles by influencing insect interactions with natural pathogens, probably mediated by alterations in the insect microbiota composition. In addition, this work provides evidence for selectable plant traits (production of secondary metabolites) that can have an influence on the ecology of the pests and could be relevant in the improvement of pest management strategies using natural entomopathogens.},

	abstract = {Plant volatiles function as important signals for herbivores, parasitoids, predators, and neighboring plants. Herbivore attack can dramatically increase plant volatile emissions in many species. However, plants do not only react to herbivore-inflicted damage, but also already start adjusting their metabolism upon egg deposition by insects. Several studies have found evidence that egg deposition itself can induce the release of volatiles, but little is known about the effects of oviposition on the volatiles released in response to subsequent herbivory. To study this we measured the effect of oviposition by Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) moths on constitutive and herbivore-induced volatiles in maize (Zea mays L.). Results demonstrate that egg deposition reduces the constitutive emission of volatiles and suppresses the typical burst of inducible volatiles following mechanical damage and application of caterpillar regurgitant, a treatment that mimics herbivory. We discuss the possible mechanisms responsible for reducing the plant's signaling capacity triggered by S. frugiperda oviposition and how suppression of volatile organic compounds can influence the interaction between the plant, the herbivore, and other organisms in its environment. Future studies should consider oviposition as a potential modulator of plant responses to insect herbivores.},

The insertion of the variant enzyme CP4 EPSPS confers resistance to glyphosate. During the process of genetic engineering, unintended secondary effects are likely to occur. In the present study, we quantified volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted constitutively or induced in response to herbivory by the soybean looper Chrysodeixis includens in transgenic soybean and its isogenic (untransformed) line. Since herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are known to play a role in the recruitment of natural enemies, we assessed whether changes in VOC profiles alter the foraging behavior of the generalist endoparasitic larval parasitoid, Meteorus rubens in the transgenic line. Additionally, we assessed whether there was a difference in plant quality by measuring the weight gain of the soybean looper. In response to herbivory, several VOCs were induced in both the conventional and the transgenic line; however, larger quantities of a few compounds were emitted by transgenic plants. Meteorus rubens females were able to discriminate between the odors of undamaged and C. includens-damaged plants in both lines, but preferred the odors emitted by herbivore-damaged transgenic plants over those emitted by herbivore-damaged conventional soybean plants. No differences were observed in the weight gain of the soybean looper. Our results suggest that VOC-mediated tritrophic interactions in this model system are not negatively affected. However, as the preference of the wasps shifted towards damaged transgenic plants, the results also suggest that genetic modification affects that tritrophic interactions in multiple ways in this model system.},

The lack of studies on the induced chemical changes that simultaneous insect and pathogen attacks have on the host plant has become apparent. In the present study, we found that pepper plant volatile profiles can be differentially induced by compatible and incompatible bacterial infection and beet armyworm (BAW) damage when applied alone or in combination upon the same host. We also found that plants under simultaneous compatible bacterial and BAW attack are able to produce volatiles in quantities greater than those produced by healthy plants in response to BAW feeding. In contrast, plants exposed to the incompatible pathogen challenge showed a total volatile release below the level of healthy plants exposed to BAW damage. This suppression of BAW-induced volatiles coincided with increased methyl salicylate production from incompatible bacteria-infected plants. Feeding choice experiments revealed that, when given a choice, BAW larvae fed significantly more on leaves of plants infected with the incompatible bacteria as soon as 2 d after inoculation, while a significant increase in insect feeding on the plants infected with the compatible bacterial strain was not seen until day 4 after inoculation. Additionally, survival for third instars to pupation was significantly higher when feeding on infected plants than on healthy plants, regardless of compatibility. These results are indicative of lowered herbivore defenses due to disease progression on the plants.},

	abstract = {Many terrestrial food webs are dominated by direct and indirect interactions among higher plants and arthropods. Direct interactions occur between a consumer and its food. Indirect interactions do not involve consumption. They may occur when plants promote the effectiveness of carnivorous arthropods by emitting herbivore-induced volatiles in response to herbivory. These volatiles are an important solution to a foraging problem of carnivorous enemies. The volatiles are emitted in large amounts and the blend composition can be specific for the plant species, plant genotype or for the herbivore species or instar damaging the plant. The characteristics of the chemical information such as the degree of specificity and thus the information value for the responding insects differ largely among plant species. After their emission, the induced plant volatiles may also affect herbivores, other plants, or competitors or predators of the carnivores. Thus, an information web is superimposed upon the food web. This information web is more complex than the food web itself. The information-mediated interactions that result from the emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles have consequences for the ecology and evolution of plants, herbivores and carnivores in a food web. For instance, other plants, neighbouring the signalling plants, may profit from the attracted carnivores, which may influence the strategy of the signaller. Herbivores may exploit the information in selecting food plants to avoid competition or enemy-rich space and carnivores may use the information in developing a flexible foraging strategy with maximal reproductive success, e.g. through associative learning of the cues.In this chapter we compare different simple multitrophic systems with the aim of reaching generalities with regards to the ecological and evolutionary consequences of the most important information flows.},

This insect is known to use host plant-derived volatile organic compounds to locate suitable hosts during both its adult and larval stages, yet the function of individual compounds remains mostly enigmatic. In this study, we use a combination of volatile profiling, electrophysiological assays, pair-wise choice behavioral assays, and chemical supplementation treatments to identify and assess specific compounds from maize that influence S. frugiperda host location. Our findings reveal that methyl salicylate and (E)-alpha-bergamotene are oviposition attractants for adult moths but do not impact larval behavior. While geranyl acetate can act as an oviposition attractant or repellent depending on the host volatile context and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT) is an oviposition deterrent. These compounds can also be attractive to the larvae when applied to specific maize inbreds. These data show that S. frugiperda uses different plant volatile cues for host location in its adult and larval stage and that the background volatile context that specific volatiles are perceived in, alters their impact as behavioral cues.},

Field microcosm experiments were used to characterize arthropod spontaneous assemblies in homogenous unstressed wheat patches exposed to volatile cues coming from wheat plants with different levels of stress. The design was a factorial completely randomized block design with three replications. Source wheat pots combined two stress factors: 1) soil degradation level: high and low, and 2) aphid herbivory: with (A) and without (B). Eighteen experimental units consisted of source stressed wheat pots, connected by tubes conducting the volatile cues to sink wheat patches. These patches were located at the end of the tubes placed in a flowering wheat field. Arthropod assemblies on wheat sinks were different between years and they were associated to the source cues. Soil condition was the main discriminating factor among arthropods when a clear contrast between high and low soil degradation was observed, whereas aphid herbivory was the main discriminating factor when soil condition effects were absent. Main soil properties related with arthropods assembly were Mg and K in the first year and cation exchange capacity, total nitrogen, and pH in the second year of experiment. According to this study, spontaneous arthropod distributions in the homogeneous, unstressed wheat patch responded to the volatile cues coming from wheat sources growing in particular soil conditions. It is possible to suggest that soil-plant-herbivore interactions change wheat cues and this phenomenon produces significant differences in neighboring arthropod community structure.},

Responses to early season overwintered field-collected male A. vittatum without food were compared with those feeding on pollen, and in turn these were compared with those feeding on cucurbit seedlings. These comparisons were modelled after transitions as they would occur at the initiation of A. vittatum host plant colonization.In another experiment, colony-reared male A. vittatum that had been fed only near isogenic lines of potted cucumber (Cucumis sativus) seedlings that either lacked or contained cucurbitacin were placed as bait in the traps. Using the inverse relationship, which is understood for A. vittatum, between previous exposure and the phagostimulant response to cucurbitacin, rates of foliage consumption could be manipulated. The interaction between relative rates of host plant consumption of the males used as lures and responses to the pheromone could thus be tested. The use of A. vittatum reared entirely without dietary cucurbitacin as bait also enabled evaluation of the potential role of cucurbitacin in pheromone biosynthesis. Trap responses were closely correlated with the rates of feeding of the beetles in the trap lures, but cucurbitacin was neither a precursor nor a prerequisite for the pheromone. Implications for early season field colonization and the adaptive significance of this pheromone are discussed.},

However, odors from citrus plants actively damaged by psyllid feeding were attractive to conspecific females. When odors from feeding-damaged plants were presented simultaneously with odors from female D. citri, attraction of female conspecifics was no longer observed as compared with a clean air control in olfactometer assays. In subsequent experiments, D. citri females were released within arenas that contained actively feeding-damaged or non-damaged (control) citrus plants, each with previously psyllid-infested and uninfested young leaves. D. citri development is linked to the presence of these newly emerging leaves which is the only site of nymphal development. Female D. citri were initially attracted by the actively damaged plants as compared with non-damaged controls. After acceptance of plants that were actively damaged by feeding, D. citri females preferentially chose and settled on uninfested young leaves as compared with previously infested young leaves. A herbivore-induced plant volatile attractant and a female-specific odor repellent appear to be complementary foraging cues providing psyllids with information at two spatial scales: (1) the whole plant level for choosing a plant potentially harboring male conspecifics for mating, and (2) the within plant level to reduce intra-conspecific competition by identifying previously exploited resources.},

To explore the extent of this phenomenon in the Cerambycidae, we first tested the responses of a cerambycid community to a generic pheromone blend in the presence or absence of chipped material from host plants as a source of host volatiles. In the second phase, blends of oak and conifer volatiles were reconstructed, and tested at low, medium, and high release rates with the pheromone blend. For conifer-infesting species in the subfamilies Spondylidinae and Lamiinae, conifer volatiles released at the high rate synergized attraction of some species to the pheromone blend. When comparing high-release rate conifer blend with high-release rate alpha-pinene as a single component, species responses varied, with Asemum nitidum LeConte being most attracted to pheromones plus alpha-pinene, whereas Neospondylis upiformis (Mannerheim) were most attracted to pheromones plus conifer blend and ethanol. For oak-infesting species in the subfamily Cerambycinae, with the exception of Phymatodes grandis Casey, which were most attracted to pheromones plus ethanol, neither synthetic oak blend nor ethanol increased attraction to pheromones. The results indicate that the responses to combinations of pheromones with host plant volatiles varied from synergistic to antagonistic, depending on beetle species. Release rates of host plant volatiles also were important, with some high release rates being antagonistic for oak-infesting species, but acting synergistically for conifer-infesting species.},

Linamarin and lotaustralin are transferred from the male to female during mating and thus are considered to be involved in mating communication. Because volatile semiochemical cues play a major role in mating communication in many insect species, the emissions of HCN, acetone and 2-butanone from Z. filipendulae are characterized in the present study, aiming to determine the interplay between the degradation products of cyanogenic glucosides and pheromones. The volatile emissions from Z. filipendulae and flowers inducing mating are measured using headspace solid-phase micro-extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. All Z. filipendulae life stages emit HCN, acetone and 2-butanone. Virgin females show higher emissions than mated females, whereas mated males have higher emissions than virgin males. Hydrogen cyanide is only rarely detected in the course of male-female copulation. These observations indicate a role for the cyanogenic glucoside derived volatiles in female calling and male courtship behaviours, although not as a defence during copulation. Males rejected for mating by a female are accepted after injection of linamarin or lotaustralin, demonstrating that cyanogenic glucosides are also important for female assessment of the fitness of the male. Volatiles from flowers occupied during mate calling are also analyzed, and emissions from males and females result in the identification of novel putative pheromones for Z. filipendulae.},

The leaves of many plant species, such as aspens, Indian sacred fig, bamboos, and palms, tremble even in a slight breeze. Leaves that are easily moved by gentle winds can sometimes resist strong winds and may have other benefits as well. In the present study, it is proposed that the movement of such plant leaves physically deters arthropod herbivory and pathogen infection by repelling colonization and oviposition by herbivorous insects. This leads to herbivores and pathogens being dislodged from the plants, and the ensuing death of the herbivores on the ground or at least their recolonization to other plants, as well as the interruption of feeding, intraspecific communication and the mating behaviour of herbivores, thus lowering their performance on the plant or increasing enemy attack of the herbivores. In addition, passive leaf movements may undermine herbivore camouflage and expose them to predation, and may also allow plant volatiles to diffuse efficiently to repel herbivores and attract natural enemies. Thus, the mechanistic properties of these leaves may have anti-herbivore effects in the wind and rain. This hypothesis can also be applied to aquatic plants that tremble in gentle water currents. In addition, genetic manipulation of the tendency for leaf movement may be beneficial for the management of pest insects and pathogens with reduced pesticides in forestry and agriculture.

	abstract = {Volatiles released by damaged plants are used as cues by predators and parasitoids to find their herbivorous prey. Here, we assessed whether odor cues released by simulated herbivore-damaged leaves in Piper mollicomum attract predaceous wasps. We applied plasticine dummy caterpillars as an herbivore model to evaluate predation risk on undamaged and artificially damaged leaves by the mandible marks left by foraging wasps. Despite observing a tendency of a visual component in the wasp attraction (more marks on dummies under old naturally damaged leaves), we observed that chemical cues play a crucial role, with recent artificial damage and leaves baited with volatile essential oils of P. mollicomum attracting more wasps for the dummies than those untreated. Headspace analysis by GC-MS showed that undamaged leaves released small amounts of compounds, while damaged ones released 63 times more volatiles, which consisted of a blend containing mostly mono- and sesquiterpenoids. Histochemical tests revealed that terpenoids are located in oil cells spread among the leaf tissue, and may be released by the disruption of such cells when herbivores are feeding on leaves. We suggest that signals of disrupted plants differ from the mosaic of odor blends emitted by the background environment and may provide a detectable, although not necessarily specific, cue for prey presence. Such detectable cues are important for generalist foraging predaceous wasps, since they spend time searching for prey in different host plants.},

In 2012, traps using lures with a 1: 1 ratio of the male-produced pheromone components (4-(n-heptyloxy) butanal and 4-(n-heptyloxy) butan-1-ol) designed to release at a rate of 1 or 4 milligram per day per component in conjunction with the plant volatiles (-)-linalool, trans-caryophyllene, and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol caught significantly more A. glabripennis females than other pheromone release rates, other pheromone ratios, plant volatiles only, and no lure controls. Males were caught primarily in traps baited with plant volatiles only. In 2013, 10x higher release rates of these plant volatiles were tested, and linalool oxide was evaluated as a fourth plant volatile in combination with a 1: 1 ratio of the male-produced pheromone components emitted at a rate of 2 milligram per day per component. Significantly more females were trapped using the pheromone with the 10-fold higher three or four plant volatile release rates compared with the plant volatiles only, low four plant volatile + pheromone, and control. Our findings show that the male-produced pheromone in combination with plant volatiles can be used to detect A. glabripennis. Results also indicate that emitters should be monitored during the field season, as release rates fluctuate with environmental conditions and can be strongly influenced by formulation additives.},

They proposed a coevolution theory that the bright colours in autumn might provide an honest signal of defence commitment, thus deterring migrant aphids from settling on the leaves. So far, there have been very few experimental results to support the hypothesis, and tree commitment to phenolics-based defences has not shown direct protection against aphids. Predators and parasitoids have been found to be the major controllers of arboreal aphids. Indirect defences involve the emission of attractive volatile compounds that enhance the effectiveness of carnivorous enemies. The indirect defence hypothesis is presented to explain low aphid diversity on tree species that are green during autumn. The hypothesis suggests that green foliage can continue to produce herbivore-inducible plant volatiles and maintain volatile-based indirect plant defences against aphids until leaf abscission.},

Data from chemical analyses and anatomical observations suggest that dorsal abdominal glands of adults were apparently obsolescent. In nymphs, dorsal abdominal glands produced (E)-2-hexenal. (E)-4-oxo-2-hexenal, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and tetradecanal. The proportion of the predominant constituent, (E)-4-oxo-2-hexenal, decreased from 72\% in the first instar to 47\% in the fourth instar. proportions of tetradecanal and n-tridecane were greater in the fourth instar than in the first instar. Observations of dissected glands indicated that median and posterior dorsal abdominal glands of all nymphal instars were more developed than anterior dorsal abdominal glands. Scanning electron micrography revealed the presence of polygonal microsculpturing on the integument surrounding the ostioles of metathoracic and dorsal abdominal glands. Chemical, anatomical, and behavioral data indicated that P. stallii has a chemical defense system based on short-chain carbonyl compounds and that this system is directed against arthropods.

However, possible effects of alpha-pinene and that of other host volatiles on the mating behavior of the olive fly have not been investigated.Methodology: Using wild olive flies, reared on olive fruit for 3 generations in the laboratory, we explored whether exposure of male and female olive flies to alpha-pinene affects their sexual performance.Results: Exposure of sexually mature adult olive flies to the aroma of alpha-pinene significantly increases the mating performance over non-exposed individuals. Interestingly, exposure to alpha-pinene boosts the mating success of both males and female olive flies.Conclusions: This is the first report of such an effect on the olive fly, and the first time that a single plant volatile has been reported to induce such a phenomenon on both sexes of a single species.

Bioassays were conducted in wooded areas of east-central Illinois. Traps were baited with the pheromone blend alone, the blend+wood chips from one tree species, wood chips alone, or a solvent control lure. Seven species of cerambycids were significantly attracted to the pheromone blend, with or without wood chips. In two cases, wood chips from angiosperms appeared to enhance attraction to pheromones, whereas they inhibited attraction in another three cases. Pine chips did not strongly influence attraction of any species. Overall, our results suggest that host plant volatiles from wood chips may improve trap catch with synthesized pheromones for some cerambycid species, but the effect is not general, necessitating case-by-case testing to determine how individual target species are affected.},

Currently, there is no simple method for monitoring C. scripta populations, and nothing is known about potential chemical attractants for trapping. We conducted laboratory assays on sources of attraction to C. scripta adults. In olfactometer trials, beetles were attracted to volatiles released from conspecifics feeding on foliage. There was also significant, but lesser, attraction to odor from unwounded foliage, C. scripta alone, and frass. The latter two results indicate the presence of a pheromone. Wounding of foliage by C. scripta, but not by artificial means, enhanced its attractiveness compared to unwounded foliage, even when C. scripta by-products were removed. In direct comparisons, responses to odor from beetle-wounded foliage were not different from responses to odor from beetles feeding on foliage. We tested the attractiveness of volatiles emitted by adults feeding on foliage in the field using modified boll weevil traps. Results confirm that these volatiles are sufficient to increase trap catches in the field. Color is also important, with yellow baited traps catching more beetles than black baited. We propose that original landing by C. scripta is mediated by host odors and visual cues and that subsequent aggregation is enhanced by chemical cues associated with feeding by conspecifics. This may partially explain clustering in the field and likewise be incorporated into sampling schemes needed for integrated pest management.},

	abstract = {Conservation biological control combined with the use of selective pesticides is a practical pest management strategy for mites and aphids in Washington hops. This strategy generally reduces miticide/aphicide inputs by 50-75\%. In some instances complete biological control can be achieved. The key to effective biological control is spring recruitment of a complex of winged predators of mites and aphids, for example, pirate bugs, big-eyed bugs, mite-eating ladybeetles and lacewings. Early colonization of hops by these beneficial insects inhibits development of mite and aphid 'hotspots', minimizing the risk of widespread infestations occurring. Predatory mite populations generally reach high levels by mid summer and contribute to biological control until harvest. Insufficient recruitment of winged predators during spring may lead to a need for single applications of bifenazate for mites and pymetrozine for aphids. These materials kill mites and aphids without interfering with predator population development. Current research is aimed at improving the reliability of predator recruitment in spring through the use of a synthetic herbivore-induced plant volatile, methyl salicylate. Methyl salicylate has been demonstrated to be an attractant for a number of mite and aphid predators in Washington hops, and appeared to enhance biological control in hop yard studies in 2003. The use of synthetic plant-signaling compounds as "Herbivore-Induced Plant protection Odors" (HIPPOs) may provide a novel, yet practical management option for improving the efficacy and reliability of conservation biological control in hops.},

In this study, DMNT and TMTT were confirmed to be emitted from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) plants infested with chewing caterpillars or sucking bugs. Two CYP genes (GhCYP82L1 and GhCYP82L2) involved in homoterpene biosynthesis in G.hirsutum were newly identified and characterized. Yeast recombinant expression and enzyme assays indicated that the two GhCYP82Ls are both responsible for the conversion of (E)-nerolidol to DMNT and (E,E)-geranyllinalool to TMTT. The two heterologously expressed proteins without cytochrome P450 reductase fail to convert the substrates to homoterpenes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis suggested that the two GhCYP82L genes were significantly up-regulated in leaves and stems of G.hirsutum after herbivore attack. Subsequently, electroantennogram recordings showed that electroantennal responses of Microplitis mediator and Peristenus spretus to DMNT and TMTT were both dose dependent. Laboratory behavioural bioassays showed that females of both wasp species responded positively to DMNT and males and females of M.mediator could be attracted by TMTT. The results provide a better understanding of homoterpene biosynthesis in G.hirsutum and of the potential influence of homoterpenes on the behaviour of natural enemies, which lay a foundation to study genetically modified homoterpene biosynthesis and its possible application in agricultural pest control.},

These attractants can be individual compounds or mixtures of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) or herbivore chemicals such as pheromones, i.e., chemicals mediating intraspecific communication between herbivores. Natural enemies eavesdrop on kairomones during their foraging behaviour, i.e., location of oviposition sites and feeding resources in nature. Kairomone mixtures are likely to elicit stronger olfactory responses in natural enemies than single kairomones. Kairomone-based lures are used to enhance biological control strategies via the attraction and retention of natural enemies to reduce insect pest populations and crop damage in an environmentally friendly way. In this review, we focus on ways to improve the efficiency of kairomone use in crop fields. First, we highlight kairomone sources in tri-trophic systems and discuss how these attractants are used by natural enemies searching for hosts or prey. Then we summarise examples of field application of kairomones (pheromones vs. HIPVs) in recruiting natural enemies. We highlight the need for future field studies to focus on the application of kairomone blends rather than single kairomones which currently dominate the literature on field attractants for natural enemies. We further discuss ways for improving kairomone use through attract and reward technique, olfactory associative learning, and optimisation of kairomone lure formulations. Finally, we discuss why the effectiveness of kairomone use for enhancing biological control strategies should move from demonstration of increase in the number of attracted natural enemies, to reducing pest populations and crop damage below economic threshold levels and increasing crop yield.},

We investigated the reproductive success of R. dominica on five of the seven plant tissues (wheat, peanuts, cowpeas, dried potato tubers, and acorns). A field experiment was also conducted to investigate responses of dispersing R. dominica to semiochemicals emitted by live males placed on different plant species. Results showed that both sexes of R. dominica responded to plant volatiles, but responses were strongest to seeds of wheat, a plant species judged to be most suitable for beetle development due to the number of progeny produced on the plant species. Similarly, insects reared on wheat were heavier than those reared on less suitable materials. In general, behavioral responses by males to plant volatiles were faster than responses by females. Responses of conspecifics to aggregation pheromones produced by males feeding on different host materials were skewed toward females although both sexes were attracted. Male R. dominica feeding on wheat recruited more conspecifics than beetles feeding on less suitable hosts (acorns, cowpeas, peanut, and potato tubers).},

Fuscumol acetate did not appear to be either attractive or inhibitory. These results, along with previous catches of spondylidine species in traps baited with fuscumol, provide evidence that fuscumol and geranylacetone are likely to be relatively common pheromone structures for species in the subfamily Spondylidinae.},

However, the use of aggregation pheromones and host-plant attractants for the express purpose of increasing the efficacy of classical biological control agents of weeds has not been widely reported. Therefore, we conducted field-based assays to determine if a specialized wax-based matrix impregnated with an aggregation pheromone of the northern tamarisk beetle Diorhabda carinulata (Desbrochers) or host-plant volatiles could increase the efficacy of D. carinulata.RESULTSThe aggregation pheromone and host-plant volatiles were formulated for field application using a wax-based matrix. Reported release rates suggest that this matrix is a viable formulation for enhancing D. carinulata aggregations under field conditions. Pheromone-treated saltcedar plants (Tamarix spp.) not only had higher densities of adult and larval D. carinulata, but also sustained greater levels of foliar damage than control plants. Increased damage from the focused feeding of D. carinulata caused an increase in foliar dieback and decrease in live canopy volume of semiochemical-treated plants.CONCLUSIONField deployment of these semiochemical formulations could be useful in directing populations of D. carinulata for increased impact on Tamarix spp. (c) 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {Olfactory orientation by insects may be guided by specific volatile blends released from sites where resources are present. Such blends need to be recognized against the odorous background of the habitat. The egg parasitoid Closterocerus ruforum is known to be attracted to plant volatiles induced by egg deposition of its herbivorous host, the pine sawfly Diprion pini. The parasitoid has to detect this volatile signal against a background of other pine volatiles (i.e. odour from pine without host eggs). Previous studies have shown that attractive resource-indicating odour (pine with host eggs) and nonattractive habitat odour (pine without eggs) differ only by enhanced quantities of (E)-beta-farnesene in the resource-indicating odour. However, (E)-beta-farnesene per se was not attractive. We studied the relevance of quantitative ratios of (E)-beta-farnesene and other pine volatiles present in the habitat for parasitoid orientation by electrophysiological methods (EAG) and behavioural (olfactometer) assays. Seven of 12 terpenoid pine volatiles elicited an EAG response. In tests of the parasitoid's behavioural response to EAG-active volatiles, a blend of five components (including (E)-beta-farnesene) was sufficient to attract the parasitoid but only when the ratio of (E)-beta-farnesene and the other compounds matched that in odour from egg-laden pine. Since the quantities of volatiles from egg-laden and egg-free pine are not significantly different except for (E)-beta-farnesene, our results show that the quantity of a resource-indicating key compound (here (E)-beta-farnesene) is validated by its ratio to quantities of background volatiles emitted by both the resource and the habitat.

In this study, we simulate the Cotesia rubecula-Pieris rapae-Brassica oleracea system, and ask how many more hosts can a parasitoid attack in a single day of foraging by following plant signals versus randomly foraging. We vary herbivore density, plant response time, parasitoid flight distance, and available host stages to see under which conditions parasitoids benefit from herbivore-induced plant cues. In most of the parameter combinations studied, parasitoids that responded to cues attacked more hosts than those that foraged randomly. Parasitoids following plant cues attacked up to ten times more hosts when they were able to successfully attack herbivores older than first instar; however, if parasitoids were limited to first instar hosts, those following plant cues were at a disadvantage when plants took longer than a day to respond to herbivory. At low herbivore densities, only parasitoids with a larger foraging radius could take advantage of plant cues. Although preference for herbivore-induced volatiles was not always beneficial for a parasitoid, under the most likely natural conditions, the model predicts that C. rubecula gains fitness from following plant cues.},

Although considerable information has been acquired on the effects of plant volatiles emitted from plants on herbivorous insects and their natural enemies, practical implementation of this knowledge is still lacking. We investigated 3 aromatic plant species, French marigold, Tagetes patula L. (Asteraceae), ageratum, Ageratum houstonianum Mill. (Asteraceae), and catnip, Nepeta cataria L.

We found that intercropping apple trees Malus spp. (Rosaceae) with aromatic plants in an orchard significantly reduced the number of A. citricola aphids present, but had the opposite effect on H. axyridis. In addition, the association between H. axyridis and A. citricola numbers was strengthened when the intercropping included French marigold. Using an H-tube olfactometer, we found that A. citricola was repelled by French marigold and catnip, whereas H. axyridis was attracted most by French marigold. Volatile analysis revealed that the sesquiterpenes Dlimonene and terpinolene and the alcohol 2-ethyl-1-hexanol were the most abundant volatile compounds released by French marigold and catnip. Harmonia axyridis was significantly attracted by 12.5 mu L/L D-limonene, 50 mu L/L terpinolene, and 25 mu L/L of a 1:1 mixture of the 2 compounds, but was repelled by higher concentrations of D-limonene. The results suggest that aromatic plants increase the resistance of apple trees to A. citricola both directly, by reducing the population of A. citricola through chemical repulsion, and indirectly, by increasing the H. axyridis population through chemical attraction.},

Whether HIPVs can also mediate tritrophic interactions by influencing the attractiveness of the herbivores themselves remains unknown. We explored this question by studying the role of indole, a common HIPV in the plant kingdom. We found that herbivory-induced indole increases the recruitment of the solitary endoparasitoid Microplitis rufiventris to maize plants that are induced by Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars. Surprisingly, however, indole reduces parasitoid recruitment when the caterpillars themselves are present on the plants. Further experiments revealed that indole exposure renders S. littoralis caterpillars unattractive to M. rufiventris, leading to an overall reduction in attractiveness of plant-herbivore complexes. Furthermore, indole increases S. littoralis resistance and decreases M. rufiventris parasitization success. S. littoralis caterpillars are repelled by indole in the absence of M. rufiventris but specifically stop avoiding the volatile in the presence of the parasitoid. Our study shows how an HIPV can undermine tritrophic interactions by reducing the suitability and attractiveness of caterpillars to parasitoids.},

Many cerambycid pheromone components have been identified and are now produced synthetically for trap lures. The range over which these lures attract cerambycids within a forest, and the tendency for cerambycids to move out of a forest in response to lures, have not been explored previously. We conducted two field experiments using baited and unbaited panel traps in northern Delaware to investigate these questions. Within forest fragments, unbaited traps that were 2 m from a baited trap captured more beetles than unbaited control traps, suggesting increased cerambycid activity leading to more by-catch in unbaited traps at 2 m from the pheromone source. Traps at further distances from a baited trap did not catch significantly more beetles than equivalent controls. In contrast, male Prionus laticollis (Drury), which were attracted by the likely female-produced sex pheromone 3,5-dimethyldodecanoic acid, were rarely collected in unbaited traps at any distance from baited traps. Outside the forest, baited traps attracted significantly more cerambycids than unbaited traps at distances up to 40 m from the forest edge, with catch generally decreasing between 8 and 40 m from the forest. Some cerambycids were collected in both baited and unbaited traps at all distances from the forest edge, indicating that at least some species dispersed out of the forest independent of any pheromonal attractants. Our results provide context to previous studies that used these pheromone lures, and offer insights into cerambycid dispersal behavior.},

	abstract = {1. Most plants interact with both arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which increase nutrient acquisition, and herbivores such as aphids, which drain nutrients from plants. Both AM fungi and aphids can affect plant metabolic pathways and may influence each other by altering the condition of the shared host plant.2. This study tests simultaneously the effects of AM fungi on interactions with aphids (bottom-up effects) and the effects of aphids on interactions with AM fungi (top-down effects). We hypothesized that: (i) attractiveness of plants to aphids is regulated by induced changes in production of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) triggered by AM fungi or aphids; (ii) aphids reduce AM fungal colonization; and (iii) AM fungal colonization affects aphid development.3. Broad beans were exposed to AM fungi, aphids and a combination of both. To test for the strength of bottom-up and top-down effects, separate treatments enabled establishment of mycorrhizas either before or after aphids were added to plants. VOCs produced by plants were used to (i) test their attractiveness to aphids and (ii) identify the semiochemicals causing attraction. We also measured plant growth and nutrition, AM fungal colonization and aphid reproduction.4. AM fungi increased the attractiveness of plants to aphids, and this effect tended to prevail even for aphid-infested plants. However, both attractiveness and aphid population growth depended on the timing of AM fungal inoculation. AM fungi suppressed emission of the sesquiterpenes (E)-caryophyllene and (E)-b-farnesene, and aphid attractiveness to VOCs was negatively associated with the proportion of sesquiterpenes in the sample. Emission of (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, naphthalene and (R)-germacrene D was regulated by an interaction between aphids and AM fungi. Aphids had a negative effect on mycorrhizal colonization, plant biomass and nutrition.5. Our data show that below- and above-ground organisms can interact by altering the quality of their shared host plant even though there is no direct contact between them. Plant interactions with herbivores and AM fungi operate in both directions: AM fungi have a key bottom-up role in insect host location by increasing the attractiveness of plant VOCs to aphids, whereas aphids inhibit formation of AM symbioses.},

Compared with undamaged plants, C. rubecula females were more attracted to Arabidopsis plants infested by P. rapae, P. xylostella, S. exigua, or T. urticae, but not to plants infested by M. persicae. The parasitoids preferred host-infested plants to spider mite- or aphid-infested plants, but not to plants infested with non-host caterpillars ( P. xylostella or S. exigua). The data show that when Arabidopsis plants are infested with a leaf tissue-damaging herbivore they emit a volatile blend that attracts C. rubecula females and the wasps only discriminate between a host and non-host herbivore when the type of damage is different ( chewing vs. piercing). When Arabidopsis is infested with a herbivore that hardly damages leaf tissue, C. rubecula females are not attracted. These results may be explained by differences in the amount of damage and in the relative importance of different signal-transduction pathways induced by different types of herbivores.},

Typical "green leaf odours", (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-hexen-1-ol, and (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate, were emitted immediately upon damage and their amounts dropped rapidly after the first collections. Several of the induced compounds were released within 2 h after treatment, while others (mainly sesquiterpenoids) started to be released after 4 h. The LG11 seedlings emitted several compounds (e.g. beta-myrcene, (Z)-beta-ocimene, benzyl acetate, beta-caryophyllene, (E,E)-alpha-farnesene) that were not detected for Ioana.

This predator uses different signals including morphological plant traits, prey insects, and volatile substances produced by the infested plants and prey signals to find its suitable prey. These signals are different in each cultivar of a plant. We aimed to understand how N. tenuis finds its prey using volatiles from tomato plants damaged or infested with T. absoluta. The predator's responses to various plant treatments on two cultivars of tomato plants were tested in a flight tunnel and a four-choice olfactometer. The volatile compounds released from the treatments were also collected and identified. The results of the olfactory experiments showed that the predators even in the absence of light chose the plants bearing their insect prey. This behavior was not the same in both cultivars, and N. tenuis had a tendency toward mechanically damaged of Early Urbana Y cultivar more than Cal JN3 cultivar. The differences in the amount of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and eugenol between cultivars may play a role in the differential attraction of N. tenuis towards infested plants. The difference in the volatile compounds was evident in two cultivars, and this was consistent with our bioassay results. Therefore, the choice of appropriate cultivar and use of herbivore-infested plant volatiles are important for developing a control strategy against T. absoluta and attract its predators.},

I tested whether mature wild Lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus, Fabaceae) growing in Mexico could be reliably induced to produce HIPVs and EFN in response to application of the phytohormone, jasmonic acid (JA), and investigated whether this treatment leads to any benefit to the plants.3. Eleven HIPVs were released from JA-treated leaves at significantly higher amounts than from control leaves, and only one (methylsalicylate) at significantly lower amounts than from controls. Treatment with JA increased EFN secretion on leaves on average by more than 30 times and on bracts by more than 20 times. EFN production, which has not previously been described in Lima bean, represents a second induced indirect resistance trait of this species.4. JA treatment reduced both the number of dead shoot tips and leaf damage by herbivores. Treated tendrils grew faster and produced more leaves than controls. At the end of the experiment, treated tendrils bore c. two times more inflorescences and three times more fruits than controls.5. Repeated treatment with JA resulted in a combined induction of HIPVs and EFN and strongly benefited wild Lima beans. The plants suffered less from the consequences of herbivore attack, supporting the use of the term 'induced defences' for these traits. JA-induced defences thus can significantly benefit Lima bean under natural conditions.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary:\& nbsp;The role of olfaction in avian life histories has traditionally been neglected, but a growing body of evidence suggests that birds use olfaction in different biological contexts, including foraging. Insectivorous birds are known to detect the defence volatiles emitted by trees when attacked by herbivore arthropods. Recently, it has been shown that insectivorous birds not only use these indirect cues to locate their prey but that they can also eavesdrop on the pheromones emitted by the prey. However, the questions of whether avian attraction is limited to prey pheromones only or whether they can detect any insect pheromone remain unexplored. Therefore, we performed a field experimental study using artificial larvae close to pheromone dispensers placed on trees to analyze whether birds are attracted to prey pheromones but not to non-prey pheromones or control unscented dispensers. We recorded the number of trees that contained artificial larvae with signals of avian predation and found that insectivorous birds were only attracted to prey pheromones, confirming that insectivorous birds are able to eavesdrop on prey pheromones and suggesting that birds are not attracted to non-prey pheromones.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}Natural selection has favored the evolution of different capabilities that allow animals to obtain food-e.g., the development of senses for improving prey/food detection. Among these senses, chemical sense is possibly the most ancient mechanism used by organisms for environmental assessment. Comparative studies suggest the prime role of foraging ecology in the evolution of the olfactory apparatus of vertebrates, including birds. Here, we review empirical studies that have shown birds' abilities to detect prey/food via olfaction and report the results of a study aiming to analyze the specificity of eavesdropping on prey pheromones in insectivorous birds. In a field study, we placed artificial larvae and a dispenser with one of three treatments-prey (Operopthera brumata) pheromones, non-prey (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus) pheromones, or a control unscented dispenser-on the branches of Pyrenean oak trees (Quercus pyrenaica). We then measured the predation rate of birds on artificial larvae. Our results show that more trees had larvae with signs of avian predation when they contained a prey pheromone dispenser than when they contained a non-prey pheromone dispenser or an unscented dispenser. Our results indicate that insectivorous birds can discriminate between the pheromones emitted by their prey and those emitted by non-prey insects and that they only exhibit attraction to prey pheromones. These results highlight the potential use of insectivorous birds in the biological control of insect pests.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Scientists have been fascinated by carnivorous plants for centuries and they have thoroughly investigated how these plants can benefit from insect capture for example through increased growth, earlier flowering, and increased seed production. How prey is actually lured into the traps, however, is less well understood. Trapping prey may be achieved in a random way, for example by camouflaging the traps (hiding them in the surrounding vegetation), so that prey is trapped by accidental landing on the trap leaves or wind drift, or in the other extreme, trapping may involve mimicry of other attractive resources such as fruits or flowers by using specific visual or olfactory signals to attract a specific prey assemblage.2. We investigated for the first time volatiles of the trapping leaves of carnivorous plant species by dynamic headspace methods. We present data on the venus flytrap Dionaea muscipula, the sundew Drosera binata, and the North American pitcher plants Sarracenia flava, Sarracenia leucophylla, Sarracenia minor, and Sarracenia purpurea. A large number of compounds and relatively high emission rates were found in three of the North American pitcher plants (S. flava, S. leucophylla, and S. minor) with compounds typically found in flowers or fruits. This suggests together with other features (e.g. colour, nectar production) that these traps are possibly flower or fruit mimics. The leaves of S. purpurea, Dionaea muscipula, and Drosera binata emitted much weaker scents with lower numbers of components, consisting mainly of volatiles typically emitted from green leaves.3. We discuss whether or not the use of volatiles for attracting prey animals is linked with specific trapping mechanisms and whether carnivorous plants can be grouped into specialized 'olfactory syndromes'.},

However, the reasons why and the details of how this type of pheromone is used by cerambycids and other coleopteran species that utilize analogous male-produced pheromones remain unclear. Thus, our goals were to test the hypotheses that 1) cerambycids respond to pheromones in a dose-dependent (= release rate-dependent) manner and 2) pheromone emission is density-dependent. If true, these characteristics of pheromone use could suggest that cerambycids utilize an optimal density strategy to limit competition for scarce and ephemeral hosts, i.e., the stressed or dying trees that typically constitute their larval hosts. Attraction of beetles to a range of release rates of two common pheromone components - 2-methylbutanol and 3-hydroxyhexan-2-one - was tested in field trials. Responses, as measured by the number of beetles caught in pheromone-baited traps, increased with release rates for five endemic species, even at the highest rates tested (similar to 1450 mu g/h for 2-methylbutanol and similar to 720 mu g/h for 3-hydroxyhexan-2-one). The effect of density of conspecific males on per capita pheromone production was tested by collecting the volatiles produced by individuals, pairs, or groups of three or four male Phymatodes grandis Casey. Frequency of pheromone production was significantly different among the treatment densities, and emission rates of the pheromone (R)-2-methylbutanol decreased with increasing density. These results are discussed in the context of a possible optimal density strategy used by cerambycids, and more broadly, in relation to the use of male-produced aggregation-sex pheromones by other coleopterans. In addition, we report the identification of the pheromones of four of our five test species, specifically, Phymatodes obliquus Casey, Brothylus conspersus LeConte, Brothylus gemmulatus LeConte, and Xylotrechus albonotatus Casey.},

	abstract = {Entomopathogenic nematodes of Heterorhabditidae and Steinernematidae families are the most used for biological control of insect pests. Recognition of one member of a species by another member of the same species and recognition of the natural host, as well as the recognition of the specific symbiotic bacteria, are due to the capacity of nematodes to perceive, respond to, and emit chemical cues. Semiochemicals mediate interactions between organisms. Those emitted and affecting members of the same species are named pheromones, while the signals called allelochemicals are involved in interspecific interactions. The occurrence of both types of semiochemicals has been demonstrated in entomopathogenic nematodes, although alarm pheromones and apneumones (chemicals derived from a non-living source that benefit the receiver) have not yet been demonstrated. Even herbivore-damaged plants emit volatile organic compounds that attract nematodes. The physicochemical characteristics of the cues, as well as the nematodes responses, are associated with the ecology and behavior of the nematode species, i.e. with habitat, reproductive behavior, foraging strategies and preferred penetration route of host, but also with the habitat and behavior of the host. Therefore, cues and emitted responses are quite diverse. Furthermore, the same chemical compound can elucidate positive and negative behaviors in different species. Unfortunately, only very few reports have an ecological holistic approach of the very complex system nematode-bacteria-host-plant-soil and the chemical nature of most cues is unknown, especially sexual pheromones. A better understanding of this complex system, the signals, and the nematode ecological behavior will help to enhance the efficacy of entomopathogenic nematodes in the field, as well as the process for mass production of these biological control agents in vivo and in vitro.},

	title = {Priming defense genes and metabolites in hybrid poplar by the green leaf volatile cis-3-hexenyl acetate},
	abstract = {Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), in addition to attracting natural enemies of herbivores, can serve a signaling function within plants by acting as wound signals that induce or prime defenses.  However, particularly in woody plants, which compounds within HIPV blends are capable of acting as signaling molecules are largely unknown.   Leaves of hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides x nigra) saplings were exposed in vivo to naturally wound-emitted concentrations of the green leaf volatile (GLV) cis-3-hexenyl acetate (z3HAC) and then subsequently fed upon by gypsy moth larvae (Lymantria dispar L.).  Volatiles were collected throughout the experiments, and leaf tissue was collected to measure phytohormone levels and expression of defense-related genes.    Relative to controls, z3HAC-exposed leaves had higher levels of jasmonic acid and -linolenic acid following gypsy moth feeding.  Further, z3HAC primed transcripts of phytohormone signaling (lipoxygenase 1) and direct defense (a Kunitz proteinase inhibitor) genes. These qRT-PCR results were supported by microarray analysis using the AspenDB 7K EST microarray containing {\textasciitilde}5400 unique gene models.  Moreover, z3HAC also primed the release of herbivore-induced terpene volatiles.   The widespread priming response suggests an adaptive benefit to detecting z3HAC as a wound signal. Thus, woody plants can detect and use z3HAC as a signaling cue to prime defenses before actually experiencing damage.  GLVs may therefore have important ecological functions in arboreal ecosystems. Plants and Gypsy Moths Hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides x nigra, clone OGY: Magnoliopsida; Malpighiales; Salicaceae; Aigeiros section of Populus) saplings were grown from cuttings in a walk-in growth chamber maintained at 25oC with a 16:8 photoperiod. Cuttings were planted in five-gallon pots in commercial potting soil (MetroMix 250, SunGro, Bellevue, WA, USA) and watered as necessary. Due to supplements in the soil, fertilization was not required and poplars grew to heights of {\textasciitilde}1.5 m in 12-15 weeks.   Newly molted 4th instar L. dispar larvae were used for all experiments. Egg masses were obtained from APHIS (Otis Plant Protection Lab, Cape Cod, MA, USA) and reared through 3rd instar on artificial diet. Newly molted 4th instar larvae cleared their gut contents prior to molting.  Experimental Manipulations All experiments were conducted from March-April 2007 in a single walk-in growth chamber maintained as described above. Poplars were equilibrated to the chamber for 24 hours prior to manipulations.  Two fully-expanded source leaves (leaf plastochron index LPI 8 and 9) were isolated per sapling using individual 15x15x1 cm Teflon/glass chambers (for photo see Appendix in Frost et al., 2007). These two leaves are non-orthostichous, which means that they do not readily share assimilates or wound signals (Davis et al., 1991). Thus, for the purposes of these experiments, treatment leaves did not interact with their respective control leaves. However, the leaves are of slightly different ages and, to control for this potential effect, we randomized which leaf would receive the z3HAC treatment. Flow into each chamber was set at 2.0 L/min, which was sufficient to avoid condensation within the chamber. The experiments were designed to have two consecutive albeit separate treatments: exposure to z3HAC and subsequent application of L. dispar larvae. We used commercially available z3HAC (Sigma-Aldrich), and prepared concentrations to infuse into each septum such that it delivered {\textasciitilde}40 ng z3HAC per application. After a pretreatment volatile collection (Day 1 and night starting Day 2), z3HAC-infused rubber septa were placed into the leaf chambers with each treatment leaf (morning of Day 2). Control leaves each received a septum infused with just the dichloromethane solvent.  Septa were replaced twice, once before the afternoon collection on Day 2, and before the morning collection on Day 3. All septa were removed during the night of Day 3, since most volatile production stops at night in this hybrid (Fig 5a). On the morning of Day 4, two newly molted 3rd or 4th instar gypsy moth larvae were added to each leaf, regardless of whether the leaf received the treatment or control septa on Days 2 and 3. The herbivores remained on the leaves for {\textasciitilde}24 hours. On the day of collection, each leaf was excised at the petiole, photographed, and then placed in a labeled coin envelope and submerged directly into liquid N2. Each photograph also contained a standard of known area, from which leaf area and \% damage calculations were determined (Sigma Scan 500, Systat Software Inc.).  Larvae consumed similar amounts on the treatment and control leaves (24 hours: z3HAC-treated leaves: 4.7  1.8 cm2; controls: 4.3  1.7 cm2).  The snap-frozen leaves were stored at -80oC until grinding. Each leaf was ground in an individual mortar and pestle under liquid N2. Ground tissue was weighed into vials for RNA extraction and JA analysis (see below). Care was taken to not allow the ground tissue to thaw at any point prior to extraction. This method therefore allowed us to measure gene expression and JA from the same tissue. Microarray Analysis To explore a transcriptome-level response of poplar leaves to z3HAC and herbivory, we conducted microarray analysis of the samples collected after 24 hours of herbivore damage.  This allowed a comparison of transcriptome-level responses to herbivory in z3HAC-treated versus untreated leaves (i.e., the set of genes that were primed by z3HAC exposure).  Total RNA was labeled using Ambion's Amino Allyl Message Amp II aRNA Amplification Kit (\#AM1753) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, 1 ug of each sample was reversed transcribed using T7-oligo(dT) priming and subsequently second strand cDNA synthesis was performed. The resulting double stranded cDNA was purified and then used as a template for in vitro transcription during which amino allyl-modified UTP was incorporated. The resulting amino allyl-modified cRNA was purified and coupled with Cy3 or Cy5 (GE Amersham, \#RPN5661) as appropriate. We used dye swapping to account for potential dye effects.  Dye coupled cRNA was purified and 4 ug was fragmented and subsequently dissolved in 60ul of hybridization solution. We used an aspen 7K EST array containing replicate subarrays of 6,705 elements in a 4*4 grid with a spot diameter of {\textasciitilde}150 m and a spacing of 200 m (Ranjan et al., 2004).  The elements represented {\textasciitilde}5,400 unique JGI Populus gene models, and included positive and negative controls (Lucidea Universal ScoreCard, Amersham) to monitor target labeling and hybridization efficiency, as well as many genes of known function. Clone information can be downloaded from the aspenDB website (www.aspenDB.mtu.edu).  Arrays were hybridized following previously published methods (Xiang et al., 2002; Hughes et al., 2001).

Adults feed upon foliage where aggregation, mating and oviposition take place. Here, the headspace volatiles from Citrus macrophylla Wester (Rutaceae), D. abbreviatus adults feeding on this plant, adults alone and adult feces, were collected by aeration and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) for analysis by gas chromatography-linked mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Electrophysiological responses of weevil antennal receptors to volatile headspace extracts and synthetic analogues were recorded by gas chromatography-linked electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and electroantennograms (EAGs). Antennal responses were recorded to the monoterpenes (R)-(-)-linalool, citronellal, nerol, citral, and geraniol; all present in the headspace of C. macrophylla. Antennal responses were also recorded to carvacrol, present in the headspace of adults and adult feces. The green leaf volatiles cis-3-hexen-1-ol and trans-2-hexen-1-ol, produced by other host plants, elicited reliable responses on the D. abbreviatus antenna. When comparing EAGs between (+/-)-linalool and (R)-(-)-linalool, no significant difference was found; responses to (R)-(+)-citronellal were larger than for (S)-(-)-citronellal. Among the individual compounds and blends tested using an open T-track dual choice olfactometer, only the blend of (+/-)-linalool, cis-3-hexen-1-ol and carvacrol (source dose 25:25:2.5 mu g) elicited significant attraction of females, the same blend was repellent for males. The biologically active compounds found here likely play a role in host finding by D. abbreviatus and other interactions of the insect with its hostplant.},

Research on plant scents has hampered mainly by the invisibility of this character, its dynamic nature, and complex mixtures of components that are present in very small quantities. Most progress in scent research, as in other areas of plant biology, has come from the use of molecular and biochemical techniques. Although volatile components have been identified in several orchid species, the biosynthetic pathways of orchid flower fragrance are far from understood. We investigated how flower fragrance was generated in certain Phalaenopsis orchids by determining the chemical components of the floral scent, identifying floral expressed-sequence-tags (ESTs), and deducing the pathways of floral scent biosynthesis in Phalaneopsis bellina by bioinformatics analysis.Results: The main chemical components in the P. bellina flower were shown by gas chromatography- mass spectrometry to be monoterpenoids, benzenoids and phenylpropanoids. The set of floral scent producing enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) to geraniol and linalool were recognized through data mining of the P. bellina floral EST database (dbEST). Transcripts preferentially expressed in P. bellina were distinguished by comparing the scent floral dbEST to that of a scentless species, P. equestris, and included those encoding lipoxygenase, epimerase, diacylglycerol kinase and geranyl diphosphate synthase. In addition, EST filtering results showed that transcripts encoding signal transduction and Myb transcription factors and methyltransferase, in addition to those for scent biosynthesis, were detected by in silico hybridization of the P. bellina unigene database against those of the scentless species, rice and Arabidopsis. Altogether, we pinpointed 66\% of the biosynthetic steps from G3P to geraniol, linalool and their derivatives.Conclusion: This systems biology program combined chemical analysis, genomics and bioinformatics to elucidate the scent biosynthesis pathway and identify the relevant genes. It integrates the forward and reverse genetic approaches to knowledge discovery by which researchers can study non-model plants.},

Despite large-scale commercial maize production, little is known about the defensive responses of field-grown commercial maize to O. furnacalis herbivory, and how these responses result in direct and indirect defence against this pest. To elucidate the maize transcriptome response to O. furnacalis feeding, leaves of maize hybrid Jingke968 were infested with O. furnacalis for 0, 2, 4, 12 and 24 h. Ostrinia furnacalis feeding elicited stronger and more rapid changes in the defence-related gene expression (i.e. after 2 h), and more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were up-regulated than down-regulated at all times post-induction (i.e. 2, 4, 12 and 24 h) in the O. furnacalis pre-infested maize plants. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the DEGs in the O. furnacalis pre-infested maize are involved in benzoxazinoids, phytohormones, volatiles, and other metabolic pathways related to maize resistance to herbivores. In addition, the maize leaves previously infested by O. furnacalis for 24 h showed an obvious inhibition of the subsequent O. furnacalis performance, and maize volatiles induced by O. furnacalis feeding for 24 and 48 h attracted the parasitic wasp, Macrocentrus cingulum Brischke. The increased direct and indirect defences induced by O. furnacalis feeding were correlated with O. furnacalis-induced phytohormones, benzoxazinoids, and volatiles. Together, our findings provide new insights into how commercial maize orchestrates its transcriptome and metabolome to directly and indirectly defend against O. furnacalis at the mid-whorl stage in the field.},

There was a significant, logistic dose-response relationship between the number of natural enemies responding and the odor stimulus concentration. Volatile components from the plant host complex, obtained by air entrainment, were identified by their mass spectra and retention times and confirmed by comparison with standard samples. These were (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, benzaldehyde, (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, ocimene, linalool, geraniol, indole, and (E)-2-hexenoic acid. The main components in a hexane rinse from tea aphid cuticle were benzaldehyde, undecane, 2,5-hexanedione, 2,5-dihydrothiophene, linalool, 4-methyl-octane, and eicosane, whereas the main components from an ether rinse were (E)-2-hexenoic acid, heptadecane, pentadecane, eicosane, tetratetracontane, and nonadecane. Benzaldehyde elicited the strongest responses from natural enemies in the olfactometer and the largest electroantennogram(EAG) responses. While the amount of odor was small, Coccinella septempunctata was slightly more sensitive than Chrysopa sinica and Aphidius sp. An increase in doses of benzaldehyde, (E)2-hexenal, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate caused the EAG responses of each natural enemy to decrease. When the doses of(Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, linalool, and geranoil increased, EAGs of Chrysopa sinica and Aphidius sp. increased, but EAGs of Coccinella septempunctata decreased. When the dose of indole increased, EAGs of Coccinella septempunctata decreased, but those of Aphidius sp. increased. This study demonstrates that tea shoot aphid complexes emit volatile synomones, while the odors from tea aphids, aphid cuticle extracts, and tea aphid honeydew contain kairomones, to which the natural enemies show a logistic dose-response.},

(Malvales: Malvaceae)] simultaneously damaged by different combinations of herbivores. Cotton seedlings were damaged by foliar feeding Tetranychus urticae Koch (Trombidiforms: Tetranychidae), Helicoverpa armigera Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae) or root feeding Tenebrio molitor L. (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Thrips responses to plants simultaneously damaged by 2 species of herbivore were additive and equivalent to the sum of the responses of thrips to plants damaged by single herbivore species feeding alone. For example, F. occidentalis was attracted to T. urticae damaged plants but more attracted to undamaged plants than to plants damaged by H. armigera. Plants simultaneously damaged by low densities of T. urticae and H. armigera repelled F. occidentalis but as T. urticae density increased relative to H. armigera density, F. occidentalis attraction to coinfested plants increased proportionally. Thrips tabaci did not discriminate between undamaged plants and plants damaged by H. armigera but were attracted to plants damaged by T. urticae alone or simultaneously damaged by T. urticae and H. armigera. Olfactometer assays showed that simultaneous feeding by 2 herbivores on a plant can affect predator-prey interactions. Attraction of F. occidentalis to plants damaged by its T. urticae prey was reduced when the plant was simultaneously damaged by H. armigera, T. molitor, or A. gossypii and F. schultzei was more attracted to plants simultaneously damaged by T. urticae and H. armigera than to plants damaged by T. urticae alone. We conclude that plant responses to feeding by 1 species of herbivore are affected by responses to feeding by other herbivores. These plant-mediated interactions between herbivore complexes affect the behavioral responses of thrips which vary between species and are highly context dependent.},

	abstract = {Background: Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgoaceae) is one of the most ancient living seed plants and is regarded as a living fossil. G. biloba has a broad spectrum of resistance or tolerance to many pathogens and herbivores because of the presence of toxic leaf compounds. Little is known about early and late events occurring in G. biloba upon herbivory. The aim of this study was to assess whether herbivory by the generalist Spodoptera littoralis was able to induce early signaling and direct defense in G. biloba by evaluating early and late responses.Methodology/Principal Findings: Early and late responses in mechanically wounded leaves and in leaves damaged by S. littoralis included plasma transmembrane potential (Vm) variations, time-course changes in both cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+](cyt)) and H2O2 production, the regulation of genes correlated to terpenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, the induction of direct defense compounds, and the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The results show that G. biloba responded to hebivory with a significant Vm depolarization which was associated to significant increases in both [Ca2+](cyt) and H2O2. Several defense genes were regulated by herbivory, including those coding for ROS scavenging enzymes and the synthesis of terpenoids and flavonoids. Metabolomic analyses revealed the herbivore-induced production of several flavonoids and VOCs. Surprisingly, no significant induction by herbivory was found for two of the most characteristic G. biloba classes of bioactive compounds; ginkgolides and bilobalides.Conclusions/Significance: By studying early and late responses of G. biloba to herbivory, we provided the first evidence that this "living fossil" plant responds to herbivory with the same defense mechanisms adopted by the most recent angiosperms.},

Only the lowest release rate ({\textless}2.50 mu g/ d) of (3Z)-lactone significantly increased captures of male A. planipennis, as compared with traps baited with (3Z)-hexenol alone. Effect of trap height, (3Z)-lactone, and (3Z)-hexenol and their interactions on the trap capture of A. planipennis was determined in a factorial experiment. Number of males per trap was significantly and positively affected by (3Z)-lactone, (3Z)-hexenol, and trap height whereas number of females per trap was affected by trap height only; none of the interactions were significant. As predicted, the greatest mean catch of males was in traps baited with (3Z)-lactone and (3Z)-hexenol placed high in the canopy. Electroantennogram tests on the bark volatile, 7-epi-sesquithujene, demonstrated the ability of male and female A. planipennis antennae to detect and respond to this compound, particularly the (+)-7-epi-sesquithujene isomer. Results from an olfactometer bioassay and field testing did not demonstrate attraction of either males or females to (+)-7-epi-sesquithujene. These data increase our understanding of the pheromone ecology of the invasive emerald ash borer, provide further confirmation of the behavioral activity of the female-produced lactone pheromone, and should increase the ability to detect A. planipennis infestations where they are present.},

Field experiments were conducted from 2002 to 2005 by using Lindgren four-unit traps baited with either synthetic pheromone or natural semiochemicals produced by male bostrichids feeding on grain in small cages attached to traps to investigate responses of the nontarget species. Ethanol was tested as a possible synergist for R. dominica as part of related research. R. dominica were commonly trapped in forested areas with its synthetic and natural pheromone, but P. truncatus were not captured using its natural or synthetic pheromones. Trapping results from these experiments, in conjunction with records of the known subtropical distribution of P. truncatus, led us to conclude that it probably does not occur in Stillwater, OK However, we captured large numbers of Zelus tetracanthus Stal (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) males by using synthetic pheromones of R. dominica, and this response was reduced by addition of ethanol. No Z. tetracanthus was caught in traps baited with natural pheromones of R. dominica. The results further suggest that Dominicalure-1, one of the pheromones of R. dominica, is attractive to Z. tetracanthus. Additionally, Prostephanus punctatus (Say), a wood-boring congener of P. truncatits, was trapped in large numbers with natural and synthetic pheromones of P. truncatus. It is likely that P. punctatus uses the P. truncatus compounds Trunc-call-1 and Tunc-call-2, or similar compounds, as pheromones. Our study further revealed that Trunc-call-1 alone is attractive to P. punctatus, and the responses were not significantly enhanced or inhibited by the addition of either ethanol or synthetic Trunc-call-2. Responses of Z. tetracanthus males to Dominicalure-1 suggest that this compound, or a structurally similar compound, plays a role in the chemical ecology of this predaceous species. Catches of Z. tetracanthus peaked in mid-April through May followed by a second peak in July through August.

	abstract = {Aphids (Homoptera) are constantly under attack by a variety of predators and parasitoids. Upon attack, most aphids release alarm pheromone that induces escape behavior in other colony members, such as dropping off the host plant. In the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Aphididae), the only component of this alarm pheromone is the sesquiterpene (E)-beta-farnesene (EBF). EBF is thought to act as a kairomone by attracting various species of parasitoids and predators including lacewings and ladybirds. Lately, it also was proposed that EBF is constantly emitted in low quantities and used by aphids as a social cue. No study has focused on emission dynamics of this compound over a long time period. Here, we present the first long-time monitoring of EBF emission in aphid colonies using real-time monitoring. We used a zNose(TM) to analyze the headspace of colonies of the pea aphid, under lacewing (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) and ladybird (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) predation, over 24 hr. We found no emission of EBF in the absence of predation. When either a ladybird adult or a lacewing larva was placed in an aphid colony, EBF was detected in the headspace of the colonies in the form of emission blocks; i.e., periods in which EBF was emitted alternating with periods without EBF emission. The number of emission blocks correlated well with the number of predation events that were determined at the end of each experiment. There was no circadian rhythm in alarm pheromone emission, and both predators were active during both night and day. Our results show that alarm pheromone emission pattern within an aphid colony is driven by the feeding behavior of a predator.},

In parasitoids, experience plays a key role in host location, a hierarchical process in which air-borne and substrate-borne semiochemicals are used to find hosts. In nature, chemical traces deposited by herbivore hosts when walking on the plant are adsorbed by leaf surfaces and perceived as substrateborne semiochemicals by parasitoids. Chemical traces left on cabbage leaves by adults of the harlequin bug (Murgantia histrionica) induce an innate arrestment response in the egg parasitoid Trissolcus brochymenae characterized by an intense searching behaviour on host-contaminated areas. Here we investigated whether the T. brochymenae response to host walking traces left on leaf surfaces is affected by previous experience in the context of parasitoid foraging behaviour. We found that: 1) an unrewarded experience (successive encounters with host-contaminated areas without successful oviposition) decreased the intensity of the parasitoid response; 2) a rewarded experience (successful oviposition) acted as a reinforcing stimulus; 3) the elapsed time between two consecutive unrewarded events affected the parasitoid response in a host-gender specific manner. The ecological role of these results to the host location process of egg parasitoids is discussed.},

Nevertheless, several spider mite species, including the generalist Tetranychus urticae and the grass specialist Oligonychus pratensis, cause damage on cereals such as maize and wheat, especially during drought stress. To understand defense responses of cereals to spider mites, we characterized the transcriptomic responses of maize and barley to herbivory by both mite species, and included a wounding control against which modulation of defenses could be tested. T. urticae and O. pratensis induced highly correlated changes in gene expression on both maize and barley. Within 2 h, hundreds of genes were upregulated, and thousands of genes were up- or downregulated after 24 h. In general, expression changes were similar to those induced by wounding, including for genes associated with jasmonic acid biosynthesis and signaling. Many genes encoding proteins involved in direct defenses, or those required for herbivore-induced plant volatiles, were strongly upregulated in response to mite herbivory. Further, biosynthesis genes for benzoxazinoids, which are specialized compounds of Poaceae with known roles in deterring insect herbivores, were induced in maize. Compared to chewing insects, spider mites are cell content feeders and cause grossly different patterns of tissue damage. Nonetheless, the gene expression responses of maize to both mite herbivores, including for phytohormone signaling pathways and for the synthesis of the benzoxazinoid 2-hydroxy-4,7-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one glucoside, a known defensive metabolite against caterpillars, resembled those reported for a generalist chewing insect, Spodoptera exigua. On maize plants harboring mutations in several benzoxazinoid biosynthesis genes, T. urticae performance dramatically increased compared to wild-type plants. In contrast, no difference in performance was observed between mutant and wild-type plants for the specialist O. pratensis. Collectively, our data provide little evidence that maize and barley defense responses differentiate herbivory between T. urticae and O. pratensis. Further, our work suggests that the likely route to specialization for O. pratensis involved the evolution of a robust mechanism to cope with the benzoxazinoid defenses of its cereal hosts.},

We used phylogenetic comparison and multivariate techniques to assess in what circumstances oak individuals advertised their species identity, evolutionary history, direct defenses, or damage. We found that both species identity and evolutionary history were advertised when leaves were wounded, but species could not be differentiated by odor when leaves were not wounded. Various fatty-acid derivative compounds showed the strongest phylogenetic signal suggesting that they may best disclose taxonomic affiliations in oaks. We tested whether oak volatile composition or diversity advertised high defensive investment, but we found no evidence for this. Wounded leaves disclose much about an oak species' identity and taxonomic affiliation, but unwounded leaves do not.

Results (-)-alpha-thujone (60.34 +/- 5.58\%) was found to be the major component in VOCs from the Shenyang population. The essential oils (EOs) from the Kunming and Shenyang populations included the major components (-)-alpha-thujone, fenchone, (+)-beta-thujone, and (+)-hibaene, identified using GC-MS analyses. (-)-alpha-thujone and (+)-hibaene were purified and identified by NMR identification. EOs and (-)-alpha-thujone exhibited valuable phytotoxic activities against seed germination and seedling growth of the plants Taraxacum mongolicum and Arabidopsis thaliana. Moreover, the EOs displayed potent inhibitory activity against pathogenic fungi of maize, including Fusarium graminearum, Curvularia lunata, and Bipolaris maydis, as well as one human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans. Quantitative analyses revealed high concentrations of (-)-alpha-thujone in the leaves of T. occidentalis individuals from both the Shenyang and Kunming populations. However, (-)-alpha-thujone (0.18 +/- 0.17 mu g/g) was only detected in the rhizosphere soil to a distance of 0.5 m from the plant. Conclusions Taken together, our results suggest that the phytotoxic effects and antifungal activities of the EOs and (-)-alpha-thujone in T. occidentalis certainly increased the adaptability of this plant to the environment. Nevertheless, low concentrations of released (-)-alpha-thujone indicated that reasonable distance of T. occidentalis with other plant species will impair the effects of allelochemical of T. occidentalis.},

	abstract = {We investigated the rapid initial response to wounding damage generated by straight cuts to the leaf lamina and midrib transversal cuts in mature aspen (Populus tremula) leaves that can occur upon herbivore feeding. Wound-induced volatile emission time-courses of 24 compounds were continuously monitored by a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS). After the mechanical wounding, an emission cascade was rapidly elicited, resulting in emissions of key stress volatiles methanol, acetaldehyde and volatiles of the lipoxygenase pathway, collectively constituting ca. 99\% of the total emission. For the same wounding magnitude, midrib cuts lead to six-fold greater emissions of volatiles per mm(2) of surface cut than lamina cuts during the first emission burst (shorter than 7 min), and exhibited a particularly high methanol emission compared to the emissions of other volatiles. This evidence suggests that feeding by herbivores capable of consuming the leaf midrib can result in disproportionally greater volatile release than feeding by smaller herbivores incapable of biting through the major veins.},

Here we tested how alterations in AMF community induced by an invasive plant species generate feedback to the invasive plant itself and affect subsequent interactions between the invasive species and its native neighbors. We first examined the effects of the invasive forb Solidago canadensis L. on AMF communities comprising five different AMF species. We then examined the effects of the altered AMF community on mutualisms formed with the native legume forb species Kummerowia striata (Thunb.) Schindl. and on the interaction between the invasive and native plants. The host preferences of the five AMF were also assessed to test whether the AMF form preferred mutualistic relations with the invasive and/or the native species. We found that S. canadensis altered AMF spore composition by increasing one AMF species (Glomus geosporum) while reducing Glomus mosseae, which is the dominant species in the field. The host preference test showed that S. canadensis had promoted the abundance of AMF species (G. geosporum) that most promoted its own growth. As a consequence, the altered AMF community enhanced the competitiveness of invasive S. canadensis at the expense of K. striata. Our results demonstrate that the invasive S. canadensis alters soil AMF community composition because of fungal-host preference. This change in the composition of the AMF community generates positive feedback to the invasive S. canadensis itself and decreases AM associations with native K. striata, thereby making the native K. striata less dominant.},

The results showed that Z-9-octadecanoic aldehyde and Z-9-octadecene acetate and other active substances were found in the hindgut extracts of male, in which both female and male adults were significantly baited by Z-9-octadecanoic aldehyde at a rate of 100 [mu]g/mL and 200 [mu]g/mL compared with the control. At the rate of 100 [mu]g/mL, the number of attractant insects of female and male were 119 and 102, respectively, which was significantly more than that of the control (60 and 75). Moreover, there was a significant attraction for both male and female when Z-9-octadecene acetate was presented at the concentrations of 100 [mu]g/mL and 50 [mu]g/mL. When mixed with the elm tree volatile (2-ethyl-1-hexanol) in different proportions, both male and female exhibited significant preference to the mixture of Z-9-octadecanoic aldehyde at the proportions of 3:1 and 5:1. When Z-9-octadecene acetate and the elm tree volatile were mixed at 3:1 and 5:1 ratio, there was a notable effect in seducing female. In addition, there was a significant attraction effect at 5:1 and at 7:1 ratio for male. The results suggested that Z-9-octadecanoic aldehyde and Z-9-octadecene acetate were probably the components of the aggregation pheromone of H. oblita.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Studies of the effects of pollination on floral scent and bee visitation remain rare, particularly in agricultural crops. To fill this gap, the hypothesis that bee visitation to flowers decreases after pollination through reduced floral volatile emissions in highbush blueberries, Vaccinium corymbosum, was tested. Other sources of variation in floral emissions and the role of floral volatiles in bee attraction were also examined.Methods Pollinator visitation to blueberry flowers was manipulated by bagging all flowers within a bush (pollinator excluded) or leaving them unbagged (open pollinated), and then the effect on floral volatile emissions and future bee visitation were measured. Floral volatiles were also measured from different blueberry cultivars, times of the day and flower parts, and a study was conducted to test the attraction of bees to floral volatiles.Key Results Open-pollinated blueberry flowers had 32 \% lower volatile emissions than pollinator-excluded flowers. In particular, cinnamyl alcohol, a major component of the floral blend that is emitted exclusively from petals, was emitted in lower quantities from open-pollinated flowers. Although, no differences in cinnamyl alcohol emissions were detected among three blueberry cultivars or at different times of day, some components of the blueberry floral blend were emitted in higher amounts from certain cultivars and at mid-day. Field observations showed that more bees visited bushes with pollinator-excluded flowers. Also, more honey bees were caught in traps baited with a synthetic blueberry floral blend than in unbaited traps.Conclusions Greater volatile emissions may help guide bees to unpollinated flowers, and thus increase plant fitness and bee energetic return when foraging in blueberries. Furthermore, the variation in volatile emissions from blueberry flowers depending on pollination status, plant cultivar and time of day suggests an adaptive role of floral signals in increasing pollination of flowers.},

To assess the potential effects of sustained foliar accumulation of MeSA on plant stress tolerance, the extent of photo- and antioxidant protection, lipid peroxidation and visual leaf area damage were evaluated in MeSA-treated (c. 60 nl l(-1) in air) and control holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) plants exposed to heat stress. Control plants showed an increase in foliar MeSA levels up to 1.8 nmol [gDW](-1) as temperature increased and they displayed tolerance to temperatures as high as 45 degrees C, which might be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced xanthophyll de-epoxidation and increases in ascorbate and alpha-tocopherol. MeSA-treated plants showed a sustained foliar accumulation of this compound, with values ranging from 10 to 23 nmol [gDW](-1) throughout the experiment. These plants showed lower ascorbate and tocopherol levels and higher oxidative damage at 50 degrees C than controls, as indicated by enhanced malondialdehyde levels and leaf area damage and lower maximum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (F-v/F-m ratio). These results demonstrate that a sustained foliar accumulation of MeSA is detrimental to plant function and that it can reduce thermotolerance in holm oak by altering antioxidant defences.},

To explain this phenomenon, this study investigates the role of BVOCs (biogenic volatile organic compounds) as signaling compounds for insect herbivores. BVOCs act as scents for herbivore insects to locate host plants, while some BVOCs show high reactivity to O-3, inducing changes in the composition of BVOCs in atmospheres with elevated O-3. To assess the aforementioned phenomenon, profiles of BVOCs emitted from birch (Betula platyphylla var. japonica Hara) leaves were analyzed ex situ, and Y-tube insect preference tests were conducted in vitro to study the insect olfactory response. The assays were conducted in June and August or September, according to the life cycle of the adult alder leaf beetle Agelastica coerulea Baly (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). The Y-tube tests revealed that the leaf beetles were attracted to BVOCs, and O-3 per se had neither an attractant nor a repellent effect. BVOCs became less attractant when mixed with highly concentrated O-3 ({\textgreater}80 ppb). About 20\% of the total BVOCs emitted were highly O-3-reactive compounds, such as beta-ocimene. The results suggest that BVOCs emitted from the birch leaves can be altered by elevated O-3, thus potentially reducing the attractiveness of leaves to herbivorous insects searching for food.},

In the course of field observations it was found that adult M. matrida beetles emerged from the soil at sunset to feed and mate. During the first 20 min of flight, most of the beetles were mates. The females emerged shortly afterwards, and aggregations numbering 20-30 individuals with equal proportions of males and females were eventually formed on peanut plants. Laboratory olfactometer bioassays showed that peanut leaves (food) attracted both males and females. Field-trapping experiments and olfactometer studies showed that M. matrida beetles were highly attracted by live virgin females in the presence of food (cut-up peanut leaves). Another set of field trapping experiments indicated that airborne volatiles produced by live virgin females plus food had the same attracting ability as live virgin females plus food. The attraction exerted by the combination of live virgin females and peanut leave volatiles suggests a synergism effect. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage mechanism of chemical communication in the M. matrida beetles: first, the males cause mechanical damage to the host plant to attract both sexes; later, the females emit attractants (sex pheromone) while eating or shortly thereafter.},

Furthermore, the dose-dependence effects of N-acyl Gln conjugates-triggered influx of Ca2+ studied in transgenic aequorin-expressing soybean (Glycine max) cells, showed: a) a concentration-dependent influx of Ca2+; b) a configuration-independent effect concerning the stereochemistry of the amino acid moiety; c) a slightly reduced influx of Ca2+ after modification of the fatty acid backbone by functionalization with oxygen and; d) a comparable effect with the detergent SDS. Finally, the herbivore wounding causes a response in the plant cells that cannot be mimicked by mechanical wounding. The involvement of Ca2+ in signaling after herbivore wounding is discussed.},

	abstract = {Globally rising CO2 has been predicted to affect plant biochemistry and in consequence the interaction of plants with multiple associated organisms. While CO2 mediated effects on nutritive compounds and direct anti-herbivore defenses appear to be well studied for many plant species, the importance of altered atmospheric CO2 concentrations on indirect defenses is only little understood. In this study, we analyzed the effects of enhanced CO2 on the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using jasmonic acid (JA) as a natural hormone-like inductor. We cultivated lima bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus L.) under different CO2 concentrations (ambient, 500, 700, and 1000 ppm) and quantified the release of VOCs using GC-MS. The total release of VOCs significantly increased in response to higher CO2 concentrations. However, the quantitative emission of individual compounds was differently affected. Nine out of twelve VOCs were released at significantly higher levels (cis-3-hexenylacetate, cis-ocimene, linalool, cis-3-hexenyl butyrate, methyl salicylate, cis-jasmone, beta-caryophyllene, trans-geranylacetone, and methyl jasmonate) at enhanced CO2, whereas two were not affected (2-ethylhexan-1-ol, cis-3-hexenyl isovalerate) and the release of indole decreased. Shifts in VOCs release under elevated CO2 likely affect efficacy of plants' resistance to herbivores, as a range of the affected compounds are of central importance in defense-associated plant-plant and within-plant signaling. Given the importance of plant-herbivore interactions in terrestrial ecosystems, CO2 mediated changes in defense-associated VOCs might have implications on agricultural and natural ecosystem functions.},

Visual cues are important for predators to locate a prey, and several species of lady beetles have been reported to prefer the red morph pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum rather than the green morph in empty containers with different colors. However, the preference of a predator on the red and green color morphs of A. pisum on green plant leaves and the relationship between the fitness of the predator that feeds on the two color morphs have not been revealed. In this study, two colonies of the multicolored Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis, a generalist predator, fed on a red morph and a green morph of A. pisum (indicated as RA-Har and GA-Har, respectively) were used to determine their prey preferences on the two morphs of A. pisum on leaf discs. The fourth instars and newly emerged adults of H. axyridis that fed on the two aphid morphs did not show any significant prey preference, except that GA-Har males consumed significantly more green morph than red morph. The fitness of RA-Har and GA-Har, including larval development and body weights of the fourth instars and the newly emerged female adults were not significantly different, and so were the predation capability and fecundity. However, RA-Har had significantly greater larval hatch rate than GA-Har, and tended to produce more eggs on cage walls or plant pots than on broad bean leaves in the cage assays. Our results provide evidences that H. axyridis did not prefer either morph of A. pisum, and also had no significant differences of the fitness. We hope that results from this study will stimulate more studies to reveal the mechanism of colored prey preference of predators.},

Previous work suggests that predator traits differentially influence prey behavior, however, empirical data on how prey organisms respond to chemical cues from predator species with different hunting strategies, and how foraging predators react to cues from potential competitors, is lacking. Furthermore, most research in this area has focused on aquatic and aboveground terrestrial systems, while interactions among belowground, soiling-dwelling organisms have received relatively little attention. Here, we assessed how chemical cues from three species of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), each with a different foraging strategy, influenced herbivore (cucumber beetle) and natural enemy (EPN) foraging behavior. We predicted these cues could serve as chemical indicators of increased predation risk, prey availability, or competition. Our findings revealed that foraging cucumber beetle larvae avoided chemical cues from Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (active-foraging cruiser EPNs), but not Steinernema carpocapsae (ambusher EPNs) or Steinernema riobrave (intermediate-foraging EPNs). In contrast, foraging H. bacteriophora EPNs were attracted to cues produced by the two Steinernema species but not conspecific cues. Notably, the three EPN species produced distinct blends of olfactory cues, with only a few semi-conserved compounds across species. These results indicate that a belowground insect herbivore responds differently to chemical cues from different EPN species, with some EPN species avoiding prey detection. Moreover, the active-hunting EPNs were attracted to heterospecific cues, suggesting these cues indicate a greater probability of available prey, rather than strong interspecific competition.},

Our experiments pertain to cross-modality priming effects in three specific contexts: executing behaviour that we call the 'visual inspection of plants' (Experiment 1), adopting selective visual attention to specific visual targets (Experiment 2) and becoming prepared to respond rapidly to specific visual targets (Experiment 3). Our findings appear not to be a consequence of salient odours in general elevating E. culicivora's motivation to respond to salient visual stimuli. Instead, effects were specific to particular odours paired with particular visual targets, with the salient volatile plant compounds being caryophyllene and humulene. We found evidence that prey odour primes juveniles and adults to respond to seeing specifically prey, mate odour primes adults to respond to seeing specifically mates and plant odour primes juveniles to respond to seeing specifically flowers. However, plant odour appears to prime adults to respond to seeing specifically a mate associated with a plant. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This plant response could be induced by merely placing the cut stem of seedlings in a solution of BAW regurgitate for 12 hr, a response that could not be induced by placing seedlings in water only. Regurgitate of BAW fed various diets, including a minimal diet of filter paper, were all active. However, seedlings placed in com leaf juice, BAW hemolymph, or BAW feces extract released significantly smaller amounts of terpenes than did seedlings placed in BAW regurgitate. These results indicate that the active components are present in relatively large concentrations in regurgitate and that they are not related to the food source. Furthermore, regurgitate from several other species of caterpillars (Spodoptera frugiperda. Helicoverpa zea, Trichoplusia ni, and Anticarsia gemmatalis) as well as from the grasshopper Schistocerca americana induced the release of significant amounts of terpenes in com seedlings. The release of these volatiles, therefore, appears to be a general response to attack by phytophagous insects. The terpene-releasing com seedlings were highly attractive to the generalist parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris and to the specialized parasitoid Microplitis croceipes. This study confirms a systemic herbivore-elicited release of terpenes in com. It is proposed that such chemicals serve multifunctional purposes that directly and indirectly protect plants against herbivorous arthropods and pathogens.},

One of the key questions in understanding patterns of potential coevolutionary links between plant and herbivore is 'what switches these induced plant defences on?' Until cues are identified, understanding the evolutionary and ecological significance of defences in the context of the plant is difficult.2. We induced host plant resistance in a marine macroalga (Ascophyllum nodosum) in the absence of herbivory by application of alpha-amylase, known to exist in mollusc saliva. There was a demonstrable change in the behaviour of a subsequent herbivore (Littorina obtusata) consistent with herbivore induction, i.e. reduced consumption, more but smaller meals and greater movement. We also produced a concomitant increase in the level of phlorotannins, compounds associated with defence against herbivory.3. Such changes in herbivore behaviour and plant chemistry provide evidence that brown algae and higher plants utilize similar salivate-based signals in the induction of defence against herbivory. Thus the possibility that such responses could be either highly conserved or a convergent strategy is discussed.},

We also analysed whether local herbivore damage can systemically induce the release of VOCs from the undamaged top of same sapling. The emissions of methylsalicylate (MeSA), (Z)-ocimene, (E)-beta-ocimene, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT) and linalool were induced from the twigs after 72 h feeding damage by E. autumnata larvae.

Pathogen-infected birch twigs had significantly greater emission of (Z)-ocimene and (E)-beta-ocimene than intact control twigs. The emission of DMNT was not significantly induced and MeSA was not found at all after pathogen infection, both being significantly different from herbivore damaged twigs. According to our results leaf fungal pathogen induces VOC emission profile differs from that of arthropod herbivore-damaged leaves, suggesting that birch is able to transmit parasite-specific information via VOC emissions to conspecifics and natural enemies of herbivores.},

	abstract = {Spathius agrili Yang (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a newly described and important idiobiont ectoparasitoid of the emerald ash borer (EAB) that has excellent potential as a biological control agent against EAB populations in the USA. In order to understand the ecological factors involved in the search and discovery of concealed hosts by S. agrili, we investigated the behavioral responses of adult female wasps to potential semiochemicals from host plants, hosts, and host frass as well as to vibration signals from host feeding and movement. Using a bioassay, we showed that S. agrili first finds the host's habitats by detecting the volatile compounds emitted by ash. In the second phase of host location and acceptance, the parasitoids detect the mechanical vibrations produced by host feeding and movement under the surface of the bark and then probe to find the EAB larvae. Contact chemicals seem to play little or no role in short-range host finding. Female wasps avoided laying eggs on EAB larvae already parasitized and thus paralyzed. We hypothesized that female wasps were not attracted to these larvae due to their lack of feeding or movement. While an induced paralysis in the host is instrumental in avoiding superparasitism, we cannot rule out that S. agrili females also use an oviposition pheromone to deter conspecific females. Together, these results suggest that vibration and olfactory cues play significant roles in distinct phases of S. agrili host habitat and host location behaviors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Our goals were to increase our understanding of the evolution of volatile pheromones within the Cerambycidae, their role in reproductive isolation and to identify pheromones for use in the development of lures for monitoring cerambycids. Over 3 yr, we tested 12 compounds known to be cerambycid pheromones as possible attractants at sites across Idaho. This study focused on species within the cerambycine genus Phymatodes (Tribe: Callidiini). We also collected and analyzed headspace volatiles of captured Phymatodes dimidiatus (Kirby). Our results demonstrate that (R)-2-methylbutan-1-ol is a male-produced volatile pheromone for P. dimidiatus.These results are consistent with prior research suggesting that (R)-2-methylbutan-1-ol and (R)-3-hydroxyhexan-2-one, individually or in a blend of both compounds, commonly serve as pheromones for Phymatodes spp. We captured Phymatodes starting in mid-May, continuing through mid-August. Our data indicate that flight periods of Phymatodes spp. in Idaho overlap. These species may be utilizing various mechanisms to ensure reproductive isolation, such as the production of different volatile pheromones, minor components, and/or proportions of components, utilizing different host species and/or host volatiles, differing daily activity periods, and/or occupying different heights in the tree canopy. Our results contribute to the basic understanding of the chemical and behavioral ecology of the Cerambycidae and can be applied to the development of pheromone lures for monitoring of economically important or endangered species.},

Even if it has been reported that females of this species rely extensively on tephritid-induced fruit volatiles (TIFVs) during host location, no information is available on the behavioural role of TIFVs on males. Because P. concolor females mate only once, we hypothesized that the perception of TIFVs could be crucial for males, guiding them towards infested fruits on which they could find newly emerged females, thus raising the males' chances to locate receptive females during their lifespan. On this basis, here we evaluate the attractiveness of synthetic TIFVs from two different trophic interactions, Ceratitis capitata-Malus domestica and Ceratitis capitata-Prunus persica towards P. concolor virgin males. The results showed that both fruit-mimicking blends, three synthetic apple-borne (1-butyl butyrate, 1-butyl hexanoate and 1-hexyl (E)-2-methylbutenoate) and four synthetic peach-borne (ethyl octanoate, nonanoic acid, decanoic acid and dodecanoic acid) compounds were found to attract males. Among these molecules, 1-butyl butyrate, 1-butyl hexanoate and decanoic acid also prolonged the time the males spent performing searching activities on the TIPV-treated surface. Because males probably use these volatiles mainly for sexual purposes, we believe that these chemicals could be classified as sexual kairomones.},

In previously published European field tests with Ph. cruciferae, only the major male-produced sesquiterpene identified from North American Ph. cruciferae [compound A, (6R,7S)-2,2,6,10-tetramethylbicyclo[5.4.0]undeca-1(11),9-diene] was behaviourally active; unexpectedly, the European species Ph. vittula also responded in these tests and in the same way. In the present study, both the European population of Ph. cruciferae and Ph. vittula were shown to produce the same blend of compounds found in North American Ph. cruciferae and in similar proportions. Compound A is concluded to be a pheromone component for Ph. vittula as well as for Ph. cruciferae. In previously published tests with host compounds, Ph. vittula preferred 3-butenyl isothiocyanate to allyl isothiocyante whereas the reverse was true for Ph. cruciferae. It was also learned earlier that compound A enhanced the response of both species toward allyl isothiocyanate. The present study further explored interactions between compound A and the two isothiocyanates. Thus, the highest catches of Ph. vittula were recorded in traps with the combination of racemic compound A with 3-butenyl isothiocyanate, while highest Ph. cruciferae catches (and of Ph. nigripes Fabr.) were observed in traps with the combination of compound A with allyl isothiocyanate. Therefore, with the optimal combination of pheromonal and host-derived stimuli, more specific communication channels may exist for the different Phyllotreta spp. Both Ph. cruciferae and Ph. vittula rank among the most important pest flea beetles in Europe.},

Both FTC-regurgitant (FTC-R) and mechanical wounding with pliers elicited expression of a variety of genes, and for these genes our analysis indicated that these treatments induced qualitatively similar responses.Similarily, a comparison of responses of directly treated and systemically induced leaves indicated extensive overlap in the sets of induced genes.

Despite being a zoophytophagous predator, the phytophagous behavior of O. laevigatus has not been previously explored in depth nor has the impact of phytophagy on plant physiology. Here, the hierarchical significance of O. laevigatus feeding on sweet pepper is compared with other behaviors. O. laevigatus spends the majority of its time (38\%) feeding on apical meristems and apical fresh leaves, which were also preferred residence locations. Here, the phytophagous feeding behavior of O. laevigatus on sweet pepper is shown to trigger defensive responses in the plant. These O. laevigatus plant-induced defenses are then shown to contribute to the repellence or attraction of pests or natural enemies, respectively. Specifically, O. laevigatus-punctured sweet pepper plants induce repellency for the whitefly Bemisia tabaci and the thrips species F. occidentalis. In contrast, the whitefly parasitoid Encarsia formosa was significantly attracted to O. laevigatus-punctured plants. The plant responses to O. laevigatus punctures include the release of an altered blend of volatiles and activation of the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signalling pathways. These results highlight an interesting facet to the biology of O. laevigatus, in which the ability of the predator to induce defensive responses in sweet pepper plants may serve to improve the biological control of both thrips and whiteflies.},

Background and Objectives: Poplar is the main tree species used in plantations in northern China, with Micromelalopha sieversi (Staudinger) representing a major pest species causing defoliation. Here, we investigated whether two poplar clones could resist this pest species and the physiological mechanisms involved. Materials and Methods: Two clones of Populus from section Aigeiros were used, with 108' (P. x euramericana Guariento') being more attractive to M. sieversi than 111' (P. x euramericana Bellotto'). Three treatments were set up (oviposited plants, neighboring plants, and control plants) to determine whether resistance was induced in plants neighboring oviposited plants. Results: Significantly fewer eggs were oviposited on neighboring plants compared to control plants for both clones, with more eggs being laid on oviposited and control plants of 108' compared to 111'. -Pinene was detected in oviposited and neighboring plants, but not control plants for either clone. Significantly higher concentrations of 3-carene was present in oviposited and neighboring plants of 108' and 111' compared to control plants at 24, 48, and 72 h after oviposition. Males, females, and mated females primarily responded to electroantennogram (EAG), methyl palmitate and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate at 50 ng/L, and to 3-carene and -pinene at 5 ng/L, and to styrene at 10 ng/L in EAG assays. When using these concentrations on plant leaves, 3-carene, -pinene, and styrene significantly reduced the number of eggs laid on 108', while 3-carene and -pinene were effective for 111'. Conclusions: Plants neighboring oviposited plants exhibited defense responses; 3-carene and -pinene were used to transmit chemical signals (volatile cues) from oviposited plants to neighboring plants; which induced neighboring plants released volatiles as a defense mechanism to prevent egg laying.},

The ratio of 9Z,11 E-14:OAc to C25 pentaene extracted from female pheromone glands was 1:23. The electroantennogram (EAG) response of male antennae to 9Z,11 E-14:OAc was stronger than to C25 pentaene, whereas an opposite EAG response was observed in female antennae. Major volatile compounds in mature Korean pine cone (Pinus koraiensis), such as limonene, myrcene, and (-)-alpha-pinene, elicited dose-dependent EAG responses of male and female antennae.

	abstract = {Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), in addition to attracting natural enemies of herbivores, can serve a signaling function within plants by acting as wound signals that induce or prime defenses.  However, particularly in woody plants, which compounds within HIPV blends are capable of acting as signaling molecules are largely unknown.   Leaves of hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides x nigra) saplings were exposed in vivo to naturally wound-emitted concentrations of the green leaf volatile (GLV) cis-3-hexenyl acetate (z3HAC) and then subsequently fed upon by gypsy moth larvae (Lymantria dispar L.).  Volatiles were collected throughout the experiments, and leaf tissue was collected to measure phytohormone levels and expression of defense-related genes.    Relative to controls, z3HAC-exposed leaves had higher levels of jasmonic acid and ?-linolenic acid following gypsy moth feeding.  Further, z3HAC primed transcripts of phytohormone signaling (lipoxygenase 1) and direct defense (a Kunitz proteinase inhibitor) genes. These qRT-PCR results were supported by microarray analysis using the AspenDB 7K EST microarray containing {\textasciitilde}5400 unique gene models.  Moreover, z3HAC also primed the release of herbivore-induced terpene volatiles.   The widespread priming response suggests an adaptive benefit to detecting z3HAC as a wound signal. Thus, woody plants can detect and use z3HAC as a signaling cue to prime defenses before actually experiencing damage.  GLVs may therefore have important ecological functions in arboreal ecosystems. Plants and Gypsy Moths Hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides x nigra, clone "OGY": Magnoliopsida; Malpighiales; Salicaceae; Aigeiros section of Populus) saplings were grown from cuttings in a walk-in growth chamber maintained at 25oC with a 16:8 photoperiod. Cuttings were planted in five-gallon pots in commercial potting soil (MetroMix 250, SunGro, Bellevue, WA, USA) and watered as necessary. Due to supplements in the soil, fertilization was not required and poplars grew to heights of {\textasciitilde}1.5 m in 12-15 weeks.   Newly molted 4th instar L. dispar larvae were used for all experiments. Egg masses were obtained from APHIS (Otis Plant Protection Lab, Cape Cod, MA, USA) and reared through 3rd instar on artificial diet. Newly molted 4th instar larvae cleared their gut contents prior to molting.  Experimental Manipulations All experiments were conducted from March-April 2007 in a single walk-in growth chamber maintained as described above. Poplars were equilibrated to the chamber for 24 hours prior to manipulations.  Two fully-expanded source leaves (leaf plastochron index LPI 8 and 9) were isolated per sapling using individual 15x15x1 cm Teflon/glass chambers (for photo see Appendix in Frost et al., 2007). These two leaves are non-orthostichous, which means that they do not readily share assimilates or wound signals (Davis et al., 1991). Thus, for the purposes of these experiments, treatment leaves did not interact with their respective control leaves. However, the leaves are of slightly different ages and, to control for this potential effect, we randomized which leaf would receive the z3HAC treatment. Flow into each chamber was set at 2.0 L/min, which was sufficient to avoid condensation within the chamber. The experiments were designed to have two consecutive albeit separate treatments: exposure to z3HAC and subsequent application of L. dispar larvae. We used commercially available z3HAC (Sigma-Aldrich), and prepared concentrations to infuse into each septum such that it delivered {\textasciitilde}40 ng z3HAC per application. After a pretreatment volatile collection (Day 1 and night starting Day 2), z3HAC-infused rubber septa were placed into the leaf chambers with each treatment leaf (morning of Day 2). Control leaves each received a septum infused with just the dichloromethane solvent.  Septa were replaced twice, once before the afternoon collection on Day 2, and before the morning collection on Day 3. All septa were removed during the night of Day 3, since most volatile production stops at night in this hybrid (Fig 5a). On the morning of Day 4, two newly molted 3rd or 4th instar gypsy moth larvae were added to each leaf, regardless of whether the leaf received the treatment or control septa on Days 2 and 3. The herbivores remained on the leaves for {\textasciitilde}24 hours. On the day of collection, each leaf was excised at the petiole, photographed, and then placed in a labeled coin envelope and submerged directly into liquid N2. Each photograph also contained a standard of known area, from which leaf area and \% damage calculations were determined (Sigma Scan 500, Systat Software Inc.).  Larvae consumed similar amounts on the treatment and control leaves (24 hours: z3HAC-treated leaves: 4.7  1.8 cm2; controls: 4.3  1.7 cm2).  The snap-frozen leaves were stored at -80oC until grinding. Each leaf was ground in an individual mortar and pestle under liquid N2. Ground tissue was weighed into vials for RNA extraction and JA analysis (see below). Care was taken to not allow the ground tissue to thaw at any point prior to extraction. This method therefore allowed us to measure gene expression and JA from the same tissue. Microarray Analysis To explore a transcriptome-level response of poplar leaves to z3HAC and herbivory, we conducted microarray analysis of the samples collected after 24 hours of herbivore damage.  This allowed a comparison of transcriptome-level responses to herbivory in z3HAC-treated versus untreated leaves (i.e., the set of genes that were primed by z3HAC exposure).  Total RNA was labeled using Ambion's Amino Allyl Message Amp II aRNA Amplification Kit (\#AM1753) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, 1 ug of each sample was reversed transcribed using T7-oligo(dT) priming and subsequently second strand cDNA synthesis was performed. The resulting double stranded cDNA was purified and then used as a template for in vitro transcription during which amino allyl-modified UTP was incorporated. The resulting amino allyl-modified cRNA was purified and coupled with Cy3 or Cy5 (GE Amersham, \#RPN5661) as appropriate. We used dye swapping to account for potential dye effects.  Dye coupled cRNA was purified and 4 ug was fragmented and subsequently dissolved in 60ul of hybridization solution. We used an aspen 7K EST array containing replicate subarrays of 6,705 elements in a 4*4 grid with a spot diameter of {\textasciitilde}150 m and a spacing of 200 m (Ranjan et al., 2004).  The elements represented {\textasciitilde}5,400 unique JGI Populus gene models, and included positive and negative controls (Lucidea Universal ScoreCard, Amersham) to monitor target labeling and hybridization efficiency, as well as many genes of known function. Clone information can be downloaded from the aspenDB website (www.aspenDB.mtu.edu).  Arrays were hybridized following previously published methods (Xiang et al., 2002; Hughes et al., 2001).

	abstract = {Since its introduction from Asia, the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal), has become a pest of many agricultural crops in the USA. Insect predators utilize H. halys as prey; however, the chemical cues used by them in prey location are largely unknown. Here, we hypothesized that tridecane, an H. halys-associated volatile, acts as a kairomone for the predaceous minute pirate bug, Orius insidiosus (Say). We conducted laboratory, greenhouse, and field experiments to: (1) assess the attraction of adult O. insidiosus to H. halys-damaged bean pods and tridecane in cage studies, and its effect on egg predation; (2) video record the behavioral response of O. insidiosus males and females to tridecane in a four-arm olfactometer; and (3) test whether Orius spp. are attracted to tridecane-baited sticky traps in peach, blueberry, and sunflower fields, and its effect on egg predation. In the greenhouse, O. insidiosus was attracted to H. halys-damaged pods and artificial plants baited with tridecane in the presence of prey (sentinel eggs); however, this attraction rarely led to increased egg predation. Although both O. insidiosus males and females spent more time in the arm of the olfactometer with tridecane, males were more responsive at a lower concentration than females. Similarly, Orius spp. were more attracted to tridecane-baited than unbaited traps in the field; however, there was no effect on egg predation. Altogether, while O. insidiosus is attracted to tridecane, this attraction did not always lead to higher predation, suggesting that this kairomone likely acts as an arrestant.},

	abstract = {Several hymenopteran parasitoids prey on mature bark beetle larvae (Scolytidae), concealed under the bark of conifers. According to previous results, certain oxygenated monoterpenes are crucial in host location. However, synthetic baits tested in laboratory bioassays are not quite as attractive to the parasitoids as the natural volatile bouquet from conifers containing susceptible bark beetle larvae. The aim of the current study was to identify the "missing components" in previously tested synthetic baits. Volatiles were sampled throughout bark beetle attacks (Ips typographus) on Norway spruce logs (Picea abies), and analyzed (qualitatively and quantitatively) by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In addition, a pilot test was done employing the relatively new technique, fast GC-surface acoustic wave detector (SAW), zNose(TM), described in the methods. Quantitative differences in volatile composition were found between infested and uninfested logs, and between different stages of the bark beetle attack. In addition, the volatile composition of logs with or without mature bark beetle larvae (susceptible to parasitism) was compared, isolating odor differences at this most suitable host stage. In general, the quantity of monoterpenes (the predominant phytochemical volatiles in conifers) was found to decrease with time after initial infestation. In contrast, certain oxygenated monoterpenes and benzenoid compounds increased as susceptible bark beetle larvae developed, which therefore could be candidates for improving parasitoid baits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on long-term dynamics of the volatile composition of bark beetle infested R abies. The results should be interpreted in the light of previous electrophysiological and behavioral investigations of larval parasitoids, and present a number of compounds that could improve synthetic parasitoid baits.},

However, females did not attract other females, and males attracted no one. The response of male H. elegans to (1) compounds (1,4-hydroquinone and 1,4-benzoquinone) released only by unmated females; (2) the essential oil of the secondary host (Nothofagus obliqua); and (3) the blend of 1,4-hydroquinone and 1,4-benzoquinone with N. obliqua essential oil was studied. The blend of 1,4-benzoquinone mixed with essential oil at the trial concentration was attractive with males. The same response was found with 1,4-hydroquinone alone. The essential oil did not have the expected attractant effect on conspecific males. These results suggest that, when combined with essential oil, 1,4-benzoquinone may function in the sexual behavior of males and females. These findings are discussed in terms of the ecological role of this putative sexual pheromone and its potential use in a strategy of control of this pest.},

Preferred hosts of M. dasystomus include oak, sweetgum, sugarberry and hackberry; although they also colonize a variety of other hardwoods. Here, we study the mate location behavior of M. dasystomus by testing the hypotheses that the sexes are mutually attracted to volatiles emanating from the larval host and that females release a volatile pheromone that is attractive to males alone. In a Y-tube olfactometer, male and female M. dasystomus responded to volatiles from host material (i.e., sweetgum and sugarberry). However, only males responded to females in the olfactometer, suggesting that females release a volatile sex pheromone. In choice experiments conducted in a greenhouse, we determined that both males and females prefer host over non-host material. In further bioassays in the greenhouse, males chose host material containing a live female over that containing a live male or host material alone. These findings are further evidence of the critical role host volatiles and pheromones play in mating systems of longhorned beetles.},

	abstract = {In many plants, the defence systems against herbivores are induced, and may be involved in recruiting the natural enemies of herbivores. We used methyl jasmonate, a well-known inducer of plant defence responses, to manipulate the chemistry of Ficus hahliana along a tropical altitudinal gradient in order to test its ability to attract the enemies of herbivores. We examined whether chemical signals from MeJA-treated trees (simulating leaf damage by herbivores) attracted insect enemies in the complex settings of a tropical forest; and how this ability changes with altitude, where the communities of predators differ naturally. We conducted the research at four study sites (200, 700, 1700 and 2700 m asl) of Mt Wilhelm in Papua New Guinea. Using dummy plasticine caterpillars to assess predation on herbivorous insect, we showed that, on average, inducing plant defences with jasmonic acid in this tropical forest increases predation twofold (i.e. caterpillars exposed on MeJA-sprayed trees were attacked twice as often as caterpillars exposed on control trees). The predation rate on control trees decreased with increasing altitude from 20.2\% d(-1) at 200 m asl to 4.7\% d(-1) at 2700 m asl. Predation on MeJA-treated trees peaked at 700 m (52.3\% d(-1)) and decreased to 20.8\% d(-1) at 2700 m asl. Arthropod predators (i.e. ants and wasps) caused relatively more attacks in the lowlands (200-700 m asl), while birds became the dominant predators above 1700 m asl. The predation pressure from birds and arthropods corresponded with their relative abundances, but not with their species richness. Our study found a connection between chemically induced defence in plants and their attractivity to predators of herbivorous insect in the tropics.},

In addition, odors from both the needles and bark of the host Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) similarly inhibited attraction. Monoterpenes of pine and spruce (alpha -pinene, beta -pinene, terpinolene, and 3-carene) as well as ethanol, chalcogran and some nonhost green leaf alcohols [(Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, (E)-2-hexen-1-ol, and 1-hexanol], also reduced catches.

Pheromone-mediated mating disruption is the most promising technique available on grapes and is currently implemented on approximate to 140,000 ha in Europe. Experience from several growing areas confirms the importance of collaboration between research, extension, growers, and pheromone-supply companies for the successful implementation of the mating disruption technique. In the vineyards where mating disruption has been successfully applied as an areawide strategy, the reduction in insecticide use has improved the quality of life for growers, consumers, as well as the public living near wine-growing areas and has thereby reduced the conflict between agricultural and urban communities.},

	abstract = {Introduction. Integrated management of wireworms (Coleoptera: Elateridae) depends upon approaches applied both above-and belowground, and over several spatial scales. While foraging, these soil pests use biotic and abiotic signals to orientate towards target plant organs. Development of efficient techniques for implementation in integrated strategies relies upon improved knowledge of this process. In particular, an important step consists of elucidating the role of volatile organic compounds (VOC), emitted by belowground plant organs, in wireworm chemical ecology. This would have a positive impact on push-pull strategies and varietal selection developed against these insects.Literature. In this work, we summarized the available data regarding wireworm foraging behavior as well as variables that should be considered when studying the potential role of plant-produced volatile semiochemicals. This includes CO2 gradients and other host-related cues, temperature, relative humidity and soil moisture, and wireworm physiological stage. We also review what is known of the sensory apparatus of wireworms, since this is involved in every step of the foraging process.Conclusion. Some baseline data for studying VOC related wireworm foraging behavior exists. Using it as a tool in applied entomology should result in discovery of the semiochemicals that underpin trophic interactions involving these pests. However, most of the key pest species are not fully described with regards to the parameters detailed here. Obtaining accurate information to fill the current knowledge gaps will be needed in order to devise new integrated management strategies.},

Predators of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) such as Dactylosternum abdominale (Coleoptera: Hydrophilidae) and Pheidole megacephala (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), are normally found in association with weevil-infested rotten pseudostems and harvested stumps. We investigated whether these predators are attracted to such environments in response to volatiles produced by the host plant, by the weevil, or by the weevil-plant complex. We evaluated predator responses towards volatiles from banana pseudostem tissue (synomones) and the synthetic banana weevil aggregation pheromone Cosmolure+ in a two-choice olfactometer. The beetle D. abdominale was attracted to fermenting banana pseudostem tissue and Cosmolure+, whereas the ant P. megacephala was attracted only to fermented pseudostem tissue. Both predators were attracted to banana pseudostem tissue that had been damaged by weevil larvae irrespective of weevil presence. Adding pheromone did not enhance predator response to volatiles from pseudostem tissue fed on by weevils. The numbers of both predators recovered with pseudostem traps in the field from banana mats with a pheromone trap were similar to those in pseudostem traps at different distance ranges from the pheromone. Our study shows that the generalist predators D.abdominale and P. megacephala use volatiles from fermented banana pseudostem tissue as the major chemical cue when searching for prey.},

(Fagaceae), was recently discovered infesting American beech, Fagus grandifolia Ehrh., in Nova Scotia, Canada. Adult O. fagi feed on both young and mature leaves of beech as well as on other species (e.g., raspberry, Rubus spp.), but oviposition and larval feeding are restricted to beech. Females oviposit in young developing beech leaves at the time of bud burst. We characterized volatiles emitted from buds, leaves, and sapwood of American beech and examined their potential as attractants alone or when combined with other weevil pheromones for O. fagi. We predicted that adults would be attracted to volatiles emitted from beech leaves, especially those emitted from bursting beech buds. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses of volatiles collected from buds at pre- and post-budburst identified two diterpene hydrocarbons, 9-geranyl-p-cymene (1) and 9-geranyl-alpha-terpinene (2a), that were emitted in large amounts at the time of bud burst. Compound 1 significantly increased mean catch of males and total O. fagi (but not females) on sticky traps compared with unbaited controls. Y-tube bioassays confirmed attraction of male O. fagi to bursting beech buds and compound 1. Attraction of male O. fagi to 1, emitted in large quantities from American beech, is likely adaptive because both oviposition and mating of O. fagi coincide with budburst. Our data suggest that traps baited with 1 may be useful for monitoring the spread of O. fagi in North America.},

	abstract = {Plants under herbivore attack are able to initiate indirect defense by synthesizing and releasing complex blends of volatiles that attract natural enemies of the herbivore. However, little is known about how plants respond to infestation by multiple herbivores, particularly if these belong to different feeding guilds. Here, we report the interference by a phloem-feeding insect, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, with indirect plant defenses induced by spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) in Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) plants. Additional whitefly infestation of spider-mite infested plants resulted in a reduced attraction of predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis) compared to attraction to plants infested by spider mites only. This interference is shown to result from the reduction in (E)-beta-ocimene emission from plants infested by both spider mites and whiteflies. When using exogenous salicylic acid (SA) application to mimic B. tabaci infestation, we observed similar results in behavioral and chemical analyses. Phytohormone and gene-expression analyses revealed that B. tabaci infestation, as well as SA application, inhibited spider mite-induced jasmonic acid (JA) production and reduced the expression of two JA-regulated genes, one of which encodes for the P. lunatus enzyme beta-ocimene synthase that catalyzes the synthesis of (E)-beta-ocimene. Remarkably, B. tabaci infestation concurrently inhibited SA production induced by spider mites. We therefore conclude that in dual-infested Lima bean plants the suppression of the JA signaling pathway by whitefly feeding is not due to enhanced SA levels.},

Here, we show with Arabidopsis thaliana plants that the whitefly parasitoid Encarsia formosa outsmarts this apparent host plant manipulation by exploiting the SA-triggered emission of -myrcene. Assays with various Arabidopsis mutants and phytohormone and gene-expression analyses reveal that the whiteflies induce the accumulation of endogenous SA, thereby enhancing the expression of SA-regulated genes, one of which encodes ocimene/myrcene synthase, which resulted in the recruitment of parasitoids under greenhouse conditions. Performance assays confirmed that whiteflies directly benefit from suppressing JA-based defences.3. Taken together, we conclude that by activating SA-signalling whitefly feeding suppresses direct, JA-based defences, but that parasitoids can adapt to this by exploiting specific, SA-induced volatile emissions for host location.4. Our work further confirms that herbivory contributes to selective pressure governing the evolution of inducible volatile signals as indirect plant defences.},

Volatile chemical-mediated defense signaling, which allows plants to mount specific, rapid, and intense responses, may play a role in systems experiencing novel threats. Here we investigate defense responses of host plants to a native and exotic herbivore and show that (1) host plants defend more effectively against the coevolved herbivore, (2) plants can be induced to defend against a newly-associated herbivore when in proximity to plants actively defending against the coevolved species, and (3) these defenses affect larval performance. These findings highlight the importance of coevolved herbivore-specific defenses and suggest that naivete or defense limitations can be overcome via defense signaling.

We measured the temperature responses of floral emissions of various common species of Mediterranean plants using dynamic headspace sampling and used GC-MS to identify and quantify the emitted terpenes. Floral emissions increased with temperature to an optimum and thereafter decreased. The responses to temperature modeled here predicted increases in the rates of floral terpene emission of 0.03-1.4-fold, depending on the species, in response to an increase of 1 degrees C in the mean global ambient temperature. Under the warmest projections that predict a maximum increase of 5 degrees C in the mean temperature of Mediterranean climates in the Northern Hemisphere by the end of the century, our models predicted increases in the rates of floral terpene emissions of 0.34-9.1-fold, depending on the species. The species with the lowest emission rates had the highest relative increases in floral terpene emissions with temperature increases of 1-5 degrees C. The response of floral emissions to temperature differed among species and among different compounds within the species. Warming not only increased the rates of total emissions, but also changed the ratios among compounds that constituted the floral scents, i.e. increased the signal for pollinators, but also importantly altered the signal fidelity and probability of identification by pollinators, especially for specialists with a strong reliance on species-specific floral blends.},

Here, we show that this pheromone structure is characteristic of the cerambycine genus Neoclytus Thomson, based on laboratory and field studies of 10 species and subspecies. Males of seven taxa produced pheromones composed of (R)-3-hydroxyhexan-2-one as a single component, and the synthetic pheromone attracted adults of both sexes in field bioassays, including the eastern North American taxa Neoclytus caprea (Say), Neoclytus mucronatus mucronatus (F.), and Neoclytus scutellaris (Olivier), and the western taxa Neoclytus conjunctus (LeConte), Neoclytus irroratus (LeConte), and Neoclytus modestus modestus Fall. Males of the eastern Neoclytus acuminatus acuminatus (F.) and the western Neoclytus tenuiscriptus Fall produced (2S, 3S)-2,3-hexanediol as their dominant or sole pheromone component. Preliminary data also revealed that males of the western Neoclytus balteatus LeConte produced a blend of (R)-3-hydroxyhexan-2-one and (2S, 3S)-2,3-hexanediol but also (2S, 3S)-2,3-octanediol as a minor component. The fact that the hydroxyketone-hexanediol structural motif is consistent among these North American species provides further evidence of the high degree of conservation of pheromone structures among species in the subfamily Cerambycinae.},

	abstract = {Beetles in the genus Sphenophorus Schonherr, or billbugs, potentially utilize both volatile and non-volatile behavior-modifying chemical signals. These insects are widely distributed across North America, often occurring in multi-species assemblages in grasses. However, details about their host- and mate-finding behavior are poorly understood. This study tested the hypothesis that volatile organic compounds from host-plants and conspecifics direct the dispersal behavior of hunting billbug S. venatus Say. Further, we characterized the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of two widespread pest species, S. venatus and bluegrass billbug S. parvulus Gyllenhaal, to assess the potential role of contact pheromones in mate-recognition. In Y-tube olfactometer bioassays, S. venatus males were attracted to a combination of conspecifics and Cynodon dactylon host-plant material, as well as C. dactylon plant material alone. S. venatus females were attracted to a combination of male conspecifics and host-plants but were also attracted to male conspecifics alone. Field evaluation of a putative male-produced aggregation pheromone, 2-methyl-4-octanol, identified from two congeners, S. levis Vaurie and S. incurrens Gyllenhaal, did not support the hypothesis that S. venatus and S. parvulus were also attracted to this compound. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of S. venatus and S. parvulus whole-body cuticular extracts indicated a series of hydrocarbons with qualitative and quantitative interspecific variation in addition to intraspecific quantitative variation between males and females. This study provides the first evidence that S. venatus orients toward host- and insect-derived volatile organic compounds and substantiates the presence of species-specific cuticular hydrocarbons that could serve as contact pheromones for sympatric Sphenophorus species.},

	abstract = {The environment has a strong effect on development as is best seen in the various examples of phenotypic plasticity. Besides abiotic factors, the interactions between organisms are part of the adaptive forces shaping the evolution of species. To study how ecology influences development, model organisms have to be investigated in their environmental context. We have recently shown that the nematode Pristionchus pacificus and its relatives are closely associated with scarab beetles with a high degree of species specificity. For example, P. pacificus is associated with the oriental beetle Exomala orientalis in Japan and the northeastern United States, whereas Pristionchus maupasi is primarily isolated from cockchafers of the genus Melolontha in Europe. Here, we investigate how Pristionchus nematodes identify their specific insect hosts by using chemotaxis studies originally established in Caenorhabditis elegans. We observed that P. maupasi is exclusively attracted to phenol, one of the sex attractants of Melolontha beetles, and that attraction was also observed when washes of adult beetles were used instead of pure compounds. Furthermore, P. maupasi chemoattraction to phenol synergizes with plant volatiles such as the green leaf alcohol and linalool, demonstrating that nematodes can integrate distinct chemical senses from multiple trophic levels. In contrast, another cockchafer-associated nematode, Diplogasteriodes magnus, was not strongly attracted to phenol. We conclude that interception of the insect communication system might be a recurring strategy of Pristionchus nematodes but that different nematodes use distinct chemical cues for finding their beetle hosts.},

The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that volatiles associated with the host attract natural enemies, as reported in cases of many hymenopterous parasitoids, and also to learn about the effects of insecticides on these parasitoids. In wind tunnel studies, these parasitoids moved upwind in the direction of the host-infested plant. There was no direct flight observed, however, these parasitoids were observed to hop and jump, and sometimes walk to their host. In the olfactometer experiments, we found that A. asychis is attracted to host-plant complex. The parasitoids' response to malathion in the olfactometer suggested that a malathion formulation when applied to plants can lure these beneficials, thus providing new insight into the ongoing task of integrating chemical and biological control of insect pests.},

Gas chromatographic/electroantennographic (GC/EAD) analyses of Norway and red spruce volatiles detected a number of consistent EAD-active responses to compounds that are known to be stress-induced in spruce. The effects of these EAD-active compounds on various aspects of adult behavior were tested. In two-choice olfactometer assays, a monoterpene spruce blend, (R)-(-)-linalool, (3Z,6E)-alpha-farnesene, (E)-beta-farnesene and spruce essential oil were attractive to both sexes. However, when they were combined with the male-produced pheromone (fuscumol), they elicited a sex-specific response: females were significantly attracted to combinations of fuscumol plus either (3Z,6E)-alpha-farnesene, (E)-beta-farnesene and spruce essential oil but males were not. Fuscumol alone was unattractive to either sex in the olfactometer. Males exposed to fuscumol, (3Z,6E)-alpha-farnesene, or a combination of both, but not (E)-beta-farnesene, were more likely to engage in the pheromone calling posture relative to controls. Both the monoterpene spruce blend and spruce essential oil elicited significantly greater trap capture of both sexes of T fuscum in the presence of fuscumol and ethanol than (3Z,6E)-alpha-farnesene or (R)-(-)-linalool, which did not elicit trap capture alone or in combination with fuscumol. The data support the hypothesis that stress-induced sesquiterpene components, such as (3Z,6E)-alpha-farnesene, are important for mediating close-range attraction and behavior in T. fuscum while the monoterpene components are important for long-range processes (trap capture).},

Feeding and oviposition by L. hesperus induce emission of plant volatiles, but studies to date do not address the role of plant volatiles in the host-searching behavior of A. iole. In this study, a four-arm olfactometer was used to test the responses of female parasitoids to odors emanating from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L., Malvaceae) plants damaged by L. hesperus females, L. hesperus males, larvae of the nonhost Spodoptera exigua Hubner, or mechanically, or to odors from L. hesperus females alone. In addition, various plants damaged by L. hesperus females were evaluated in the olfactometer: cotton, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L., Fabaceae), common groundsel (Senecio vulgaris L., Asteraceae), annual ragweed (Ambrosia artemisifolia L., Asteraceae), and redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L., Amaranthaceae). In all olfactometry bioassays, treatment odors were compared against three controls (humidified air). Results showed that A. iole females were consistently attracted to odors derived from different plant-L. hesperus complexes, while odors from plants subjected to nonhost (S. exigua) or mechanical damage and L. hesperus females alone were not attractive or only variably attractive. These findings suggest that while searching for hosts A. iole females use specific volatiles induced by L. hesperus feeding and oviposition to locate hosts inhabiting a wide variety of plants, including annual and perennial species from four plant families. It was suggested that future research should seek to identify the chemical elicitors involved in the release of plant volatiles attractive to A. iole females.},

We studied such a tritrophic system measuring the olfactory responses of three potter wasp species (Symmorphus murarius, Symmorphus gracilis, Discoelius zonalis, Hymenoptera: Eumeninae) to salicylaldehyde, sequestered as a defence compound by Chrysomela leaf beetle larvae when feeding on Salicaceae, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by aspen (Populus tremula, Salicaceae). In electroantennographic recordings (EAG), the highly specialized S. murarius that almost exclusively feeds on larvae of Salicaceae-feeding Chrysomela species was more sensitive to salicylaldehyde than the less specialized S. gracilis, feeding on such Chrysomela species but also weevil larvae. In contrast the related D. zonalis, foraging for microlepidoptera caterpillars on various host plants, did not respond at all. Furthermore, the three wasp species responded differently to aspen VOCs in GC-MS/EAD measurements. These results indicate that the sense of smell of predatory potter wasps differs for prey and plant volatiles among related wasp species according to their degree of host specialization. The considerable differences in salicylaldehyde perception suggest that its originally defensive function has backfired as it is used by specialist potter wasps for prey location. This is an important clue on adaptive mechanisms of the highest trophic level of the well-studied evolutionary arms race among Chrysomela leaf beetles, their host plants and their enemies.},

We hypothesised that the gravid females of E. postvittana discriminate between B. cinerea-infected and uninfected leaves of V. vinifera for oviposition to maximise their offspring performance. We characterised volatiles from B. cinerea-infected and uninfected leaves of V. vinifera. We tested the effect of volatiles from B. cinerea-infected leaves on the olfactory behaviour of E. postvittana using a wind-tunnel assay. We raised the neonate larvae of E. postvittana on B. cinerea-infected and uninfected leaves to characterise their development and life-history performance. The key volatiles from B. cinerea-infected V. vinifera leaves were 2-hexene-1-ol, 2-hexenal (E), 1-hexanol, 3-octanone, and 1-octen-3-ol, whereas the same leaves included highly reduced levels of nonanal, benzaldehyde, acetic acid, and hexanal. Results from the wind-tunnel assays showed that gravid females avoid infected leaves, suggesting that the induced and reduced volatiles, subsequent to infection, may be used as a signal in oviposition-site selection by E. postvittana. This is further confirmed by the total failure of our attempts to rear neonate larvae to adult on B. cinerea-infected leaves.},

Among some species in the subfamily Cerambycinae, interspecific attraction is minimized by temporal segregation, and/or by minor pheromone components that synergize attraction of conspecifics or inhibit attraction of heterospecifics. Less is known about pheromone-based mechanisms of reproductive isolation among species in the largest subfamily, the Lamiinae. Here, we present evidence that the pheromone systems of two sympatric lamiine species consist of synergistic blends of enantiomers of (E)-6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-2-ol (fuscumol) and the structurally related (E)-6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-2-yl acetate (fuscumol acetate), as a mechanism by which species-specific blends of pheromone components can minimize interspecific attraction. Male Astylidius parvus (LeConte) were found to produce (R)-and (S)-fuscumol + (R)-fuscumol acetate + geranylacetone, whereas males of Lepturges angulatus (LeConte) produced (R)-and (S)-fuscumol acetate + geranylacetone. Field experiments confirmed that adult beetles were attracted only by their species-specific blend of the enantiomers of fuscumol and fuscumol acetate, respectively, and not to the individual enantiomers. Because other lamiine species are known to produce single enantiomers or blends of enantiomers of fuscumol and/or fuscumol acetate, synergism between enantiomers, or inhibition by enantiomers, may be a widespread mechanism for forming species-specific pheromone blends in this subfamily.},

The host species, Drosophila melanogaster, uses food odors and aggregation pheromone to find a suitable resource for reproduction. The larval parasitoid, Leptopilina heterotoma, uses these same odors to find its hosts. We show that when parasitoids can respond to food odors, this negatively affects fruit fly population growth. However, extra parasitoid responsiveness to aggregation pheromone does not affect fruit fly population growth. Our results indicate that the use of the aggregation pheromone by D. melanogaster does not lead to an increased risk of parasitism.

Both species are able to complete development to the adult stage within the new host. Trissolcus basalis (Platygastridae = Scelionidae), which is not associated with H. halys in the field, was reared from freeze-killed sentinel eggs placed on soybean plants in central Italy.

	abstract = {Synthetic plant volatile lures attract natural enemies, but may have non-target effects due to the multifunctional nature of volatile signals. For example, methyl salicylate (MeSA) is used to attract predators, yet also serves as a signaling hormone involved in plant pathogen defense. We investigated the consequences of deploying MeSA lures to attract predators for tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) defense against herbivores. To understand the spatial distribution of the lure's effect, we exposed tomatoes in the field to MeSA along a linear distance gradient and induced defenses by simulating feeding by hornworm caterpillars in a fully crossed factorial design (+/- MeSA, +/- herbivory). Subsequently, we analyzed activity of several defensive proteins (protease inhibitors, polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase), development of hornworm larvae (Manduca sexta), growth of fungal pathogens (Cladosporium and Alternaria), and attractiveness to herbivores and predators. Overall, MeSA-exposed plants were more resistant to both insects and pathogens. Secondary pathogen infection was reduced by 25\% in MeSA exposed plants, possibly due to elevated polyphenol oxidase activity. Interestingly, we found that lures affected plant pathogen defenses equivalently across all distances (up to 4 m away) indicating that horizontal diffusion of a synthetic volatile may be greater than previously assumed. While thrips avoided colonizing hornworm- damaged tomato plants, this induced resistance was not observed upon pre-exposure to MeSA, suggesting that MeSA suppresses the repellant effect induced by herbivory. Thus, using MeSA lures in biological control may inadvertently protect crops from pathogens, but has mixed effects on plant resistance to insect herbivores.},

	abstract = {The disruption of chemical communication between insects and host plants may take place due to an interference with the signal-emitting host plant, or the signal-receiving insect, compromising the signal production and emission, or its reception and processing. Anthropogenic compounds, in general, and pesticides, in particular, may impair the chemical communication that mediates host location by insects. Five different pesticides (the insecticides malathion, pyrethrins and spinetoram, and the fungicides fenhexamid and pyrimethanil) were applied at their field rates to raspberry fruits, or Petri dishes enclosing adult spotted wing Drosophila (SWD; Drosophila suzukii), and the attraction to fruit volatiles was evaluated in a series of two-choice flight bioassays. The application of raspberry fruit with pesticides did not statistically affect attraction of unexposed adults, with exceptions being the spinetoram treatment, which led to mild insect avoidance, and the pyrethrin treatment, which resulted in slightly preferential attraction. In contrast, adults sublethally exposed to the pesticides had their flight take-off impaired by the insecticides, but not by the fungicides. Furthermore, all pesticides, and particularly the insecticides, compromised the upwind capture of adults. Thus, the treatment with pesticides may indeed interfere with the flight response of SWD to host volatiles, particularly when the insects were previously exposed to pesticides. These findings are suggestive of the potential for sublethal insecticidal exposures to aid pest control and also provide evidence that pesticide use may compromise sampling/trapping strategies for this pest species that are based on attraction to host volatiles.},

Progress in this field has rendered a more complete picture of how insects exploit chemical information in their surroundings in order to survive and navigate their world successfully. Simultaneously, this progress has prompted new research questions about the evolution of insect chemosensation and related ecological adaptations, molecular mechanisms that mediate commonly observed behaviors, and the consequences of chemically mediated interactions in different ecosystems. Themed meetings, workshops, and summer schools are ideal platforms for discussing scientific advancements as well as identifying gaps and challenges within the discipline. From the 11th to the 22nd of June 2018, the 11th annual PhD course in ICE was held at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) Alnarp, Sweden. The course was made up of 35 student participants from 22 nationalities (Fig. 1a) as well as 32 lecturers. Lectures and laboratory demonstrations were supported by literature seminars, and four broad research areas were covered: (1) multitrophic interactions and plant defenses, (2) chemical communication focusing on odor sensing, processing, and behavior, (3) disease vectors, and (4) applied aspects of basic ICE research in agriculture. This particular article contains a summary and brief synthesis of these main emergent themes and discussions from the ICE 2018 course. In addition, we also provide suggestions on teaching the next generation of ICE scientists, especially during unprecedented global situations.},

It has often been suggested that they do this by learning the association between odors and the presence of food. Indeed, associative learning was demonstrated for a range of animals under laboratory conditions and individuals usually take seconds to hours to modify their behavior. However, it is poorly understood at which timescale field populations and communities of animal species respond. We studied this by exposing egg batches of arthropod herbivores, half of which were combined with a volatile, to a community of natural enemies in the field. We used mint oil as a volatile blend, which we showed not to be attractive in the laboratory for 2 predators that commonly occur in the field. The predation of egg batches with volatiles in the field was initially slightly lower than that of batches without volatiles, indicating that the odor was not innately attractive to the natural enemies. However, relative to the controls, the predation of eggs associated with volatiles increased significantly over a period of 4-5 days. This suggests that individuals in the community of natural enemies associated the presence of eggs with the volatiles. We observed 3 different types of predation, indicating that various groups of predator species were responsible for predation in the field. Our results show that communities of animals rapidly associate volatiles with food in the field.},

We hypothesized that there should be a common link in chemical signaling mediating host location by these Scolytids. Using laboratory behavioral assays and chemical analysis we demonstrate that the yellow-orange exocarp stage of coffee berries, which attracts the coffee berry borer, releases relatively high amounts of volatiles including conophthorin, chalcogran, frontalin and sulcatone that are typically associated with Scolytinae chemical ecology. The green stage of the berry produces a much less complex bouquet containing small amounts of conophthorin but no other compounds known as bark beetle semiochemicals. In behavioral assays, the coffee berry borer was attracted to the spiroacetals conophthorin and chalcogran, but avoided the monoterpenes verbenone and a-pinene, demonstrating that, as in their conifer-attacking relatives in temperate zones, the use of host and non-host volatiles is also critical in host finding by tropical species. We speculate that microorganisms formed a common basis for the establishment of crucial chemical signals comprising inter-and intraspecific communication systems in both temperate-and tropical-occurring bark beetles attacking gymnosperms and angiosperms.},

A recent study demonstrated that these networks can act as conduits for aphid-induced signals between plants, activating chemical defenses in uninfested neighboring plants so that they become unattractive to aphids but attractive to their enemies (parasitoids). The benefit to the neighboring plants will increase if the signal speed is rapid, enabling them to respond before aphids attack. Here, we determine the speed of aphid-induced signal transfer between plants infested with aphids ("donor") and neighboring aphid-free plants that were either connected or unconnected to the donor via a common mycelial network. Induced changes in plant volatiles from neighbors connected to donors started within 24 h of aphid infestation of donors. This demonstrates a rapid signal, implying potential benefit to plants receiving the signal, and raises intriguing ecological and evolutionary questions.},

	abstract = {In nature, most species of Lepidoptera are attacked by parasitoids, and some species may be hosts for several parasitoid species. When hosts are parasitized by more than one female of the same species (=superparasitism) or females of different species (=multiparasitism), then intrinsic competition occurs for control of host resources. To reduce competition, some parasitoids are able to recognize the difference between parasitized and unparasitized hosts. Inter- and intra-specific host discrimination were investigated in the two sympatric species, the gregarious Cotesia kariyai (Watanabe) and solitary Meteorus pulchricornis (Wesmael), endoparasitoids of the Oriental armyworm Mythimna separata (Walker). To measure host discrimination, choice experiments were conducted in which females of both species foraged and chose between healthy host larvae and hosts initially parasitized by either C. kariyai or M. pulchricornis. An olfactory test was also performed to examine the discrimination behavior of the two parasitoids. Our results showed that, in oviposition choice tests, both braconid female wasps were able to discriminate between unparasitized hosts and from four to seven day-old hosts previously attacked by conspecific and heterospecific wasps. On the other hand, superparasitism and multiparasitism occurred even in host larvae that were parasitized two days earlier. However, once the immature parasitoids hosts are at larval stage (1st and 2nd instar), super- and multiparasitism were avoided in the two-choice test, but the latter often occurred in the multiple-choice experiment. Host discrimination abilities may have been based on plant volatile signals incurred from damaged plants and internal mechanisms from four to seven post-parasitized hosts.},

	abstract = {Some plant species attacked by herbivore species produce additional resources to attract predators and induce an indirect defence process. We evaluated whether Palicourea rigida (Rubiaceae) individuals can induce indirect defences as response to herbivory simulation by increasing pericarpial nectar production and volatile emissions, as well as whether spiders are attracted by such induced indirect defences. We selected 30 P. rigida individuals and simulated herbivory in 15 of them by cutting out half of all leaves using pruning shears. We did not manipulate the other 15 plants (control group). At three different times, we measured nectar volume and calories of the pericarpial nectary in the inflorescences of all plants of control and treatment groups. We also quantified spider abundance on these plants. In another experiment, we selected salticid spider, Thiodina sp., to determine whether predators detect chemical tracks of plant volatiles produced by the plant after herbivory simulations. We also tested whether the honey solution could emit olfactory signals capable of attractive spiders. We showed that P. rigida produced higher volume of pericarpial nectar presenting more calories after herbivory simulation. The abundance of spiders was higher in plants subjected to herbivory simulation than control plants. Thiodina sp. did not respond to the volatile chemical tracks produced by the leaves after the simulation, but it had a positive response to olfactory tracks associated with the sucrose solution. Such an outcome indicates the ability of this spider to locate nectar honey plants and olfactory signals of honey. Thus, plants respond to the action of herbivores by producing more pericarpial nectar and nectar with more calories. Although our knowledge about the olfactory physiology of arachnids remains incipient, we highlight the importance of chemical and olfactory tracks for decision-making of spiders in foraging on plants and the herbivory influence on the behaviour of cursorial spiders.},

Adult males produce aggregation-sex pheromones that attract both sexes. Twenty independent field bioassays explored the pheromone chemistry of the species and tested the possible attractive or antagonistic effects of compounds that are not produced by a given species, but are pheromone components of other species. Analyses of beetle-produced volatiles revealed compounds that had not been reported previously from several of the species. The most common pheromone component was (R)-3-hydroxyhexan-2-one, but pheromones of some species included isomers of the related 2,3-hexanediols. Males of the congeners Phymatodes amoenus (Say) and Phymatodes testaceus (L.) produced pure (R)-2-methylbutan-1-ol. Enantiomers of 2-methylbutan-1-ol also proved to be powerful synergists for Megacyllene caryae (Gahan), Sarosesthes fulminans (F.), and Xylotrechus colonus (F.). The major components of pheromone blends were consistently present in collections of headspace volatiles from male beetles, and only the major components were inherently attractive to a subset of species when tested as single components. Minor components of some species acted as powerful synergists, but in other cases appeared not to influence attraction. Among the minor components identified in headspace extracts from males, 2,3-hexanedione and 2-hydroxyhexan-3-one appeared to be analytical artifacts or biosynthetic by-products, and were neither attractants nor synergists. The antagonistic effects of minor compounds produced by heterospecific males suggest that these compounds serve to maintain prezygotic reproductive isolation among some species that share pheromone components.},

We tested the hypothesis that one or more of the ALB contact sex pheromones is a precursor that undergoes abiotic oxidation to yield volatile pheromone components, and evaluated the activity of these compounds using laboratory and field bioassays. Gas chromatography coupled electroantennography detection (GC-EAD) analysis indicated the presence of three antennally active aldehydes (heptanal, nonanal, and hexadecanal) in female cuticular extracts exposed to ozone or UV and visible light. In laboratory bioassays using a Y-tube olfactometer, males were preferentially attracted to ozonized female body washes over crude body washes. Similarly, synthetic formulations of these compounds were preferred over controls in the olfactometer. Field trapping experiments conducted from 2006 to 2008 in Ningxia, China showed that synthetic lures of the three aldehydes formulated in a ratio simulating that of virgin females attracted more beetles compared to controls, and that combinations of these aldehydes, linalool oxide, and host kairomones captured more beetles than controls, and captured significantly more males.},

Greater biological control services can be achieved by enhancing agroecosystems to be more favorable to the presence, survival, and growth of natural enemy populations. One approach that has been tested in numerous agricultural systems is the deployment of synthetic chemicals that mimic those produced by the plant when under attack by pests. These signals may attract arthropod natural enemies to crop habitats and thus potentially improve biological control activity locally. A 2-yr field study was conducted in the cotton agroecosystem to evaluate the potential of synthetic methyl salicylate (MeSA) to attract native arthropod natural enemies and to enhance biological control services on two key pests. Slow-release packets of MeSA were deployed in replicated cotton plots season long. The abundance of multiple taxa of natural enemies and two major pests were monitored weekly by several sampling methods. The deployment of MeSA failed to increase natural enemy abundance and pest densities did not decline. Predator to prey ratios, used as a proxy to estimate biological control function, also largely failed to increase with MeSA deployment. One exception was a season-long increase in the ratio of Orius tristicolor (White) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) to Bemisia argentifolii Bellows and Perring (= Bemisia tabaci MEAM1) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) adults within the context of biological control informed action thresholds. Overall results suggest that MeSA would not likely enhance conservation biological control by the natural enemy community typical of U.S. western cotton production systems.},

However, contact toxicity, in vivo metabolism, and ecological functions of host monoterpenes are poorly understood at the spruce tree-bark beetle-predator tritrophic level. Spruce monoterpenes including S-(-)-alpha-pinene, R-(+)-alpha-pinene, and myrcene showed contact toxicity to I. typographus, with LD50 values ranging from 22-32 mu g/mg. When topically treated with S-(-)-alpha-pinene or R-(+)-alpha-pinene, the amounts of volatile metabolites, including 4S-(-)-cis-verbenol, 4S-(+)-/4R-(-)-trans-verbenol, R-(+)-/S-(-)-verbenone and 1R-(-)-/1S-(+)-myrtenol, in the hindgut extracts of I. typographus varied significantly between sexes, and their quality (enantiomeric composition) varied significantly with the chirality of alpha-pinene. More importantly, S-(-)-alpha-pinene induced male adults to produce large amounts of 4S-(-)-cis-verbenol and S-(-)-verbenone. When topically treated with myrcene, the expected semiochemicals such as E-myrcenol, ipsenol and ipsdienol were not detected in the beetle hindguts, indicating that the pheromone biosynthetic system of I. typographus does not participate in the metabolism of host myrcene. In trap tests, S-(-)-alpha-pinene and R-(+)-alpha-pinene increased the catches of I. typographus and its predator Thanasimus substriatus in pheromone-baited traps, whereas myrcene exhibited a strong repellent (or inhibitory) effect on I. typographus but not on its predator. I. typographus seems to adopt different ecological strategies (e.g. avoidance to myrcene and preference for alpha-pinene) to adapt to and tolerate different host monoterpenes. Extensive investigation of these monoterpenes will help us understand their roles in manipulating the arms race between host trees and bark beetles, and potentially improve the efficacy of controlling I. typographus via the push-pull strategy using host kairomones.},

The tea geometrid Ectropis obliqua is one of the most devastating leaf-feeding pests of tea plants. Here, plant-plant communication experiments demonstrated that volatiles emitted from tea plants infested by E. obliqua larvae triggered neighbouring plants to release volatiles that repel E. obliqua adult, especially mated females. Volatile analyses revealed that the quantity of eight volatiles increased dramatically when plants were exposed to volatiles emitted by infested tea plants, including (Z)-3-hexenol, linalool, alpha-farnesene, beta-Ocimene and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT). The results of behavioural bioassays demonstrated that beta-Ocimene strongly repelled mated E. obliqua females. Individual volatile compound exposure experiments revealed that (Z)-3-hexenol, linalool, alpha-farnesene and DMNT triggered the emission of beta-Ocimene from tea plants. Chemical inhibition experiments demonstrated that the emission of beta-Ocimene induced by (Z)-3-hexenol, linalool, alpha-farnesene and DMNT were dependent on Ca2+ and JA signalling. These findings help us to understand how E. obliqua moths respond to volatiles emitted from tea plants and provide new insight into volatile-mediated plant-plant interactions.

In both years, peak captures were at 680 DD10 degrees C. Trapping was conducted in Naugatuck State Forest in Naugatuck, CT. Little is known about the ecology and biology of the tumbling flower beetles (Coleoptera: Mordellidae), and the larval food plant for this species is not known. Thus, we cannot say why the beetle is attracted to sweet birch oil. Sweet birch oil is approximate to 99.8\% methyl salicylate (MeSA). MeSA is found constitutively in large quantities in some plants, but it is also an important signal in, and product of, plant stress-response pathways. MeSA has been found to attract both herbivores that need stressed plants as food and natural enemies of herbivores in stressed plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of mass trapping of a tumbling flower beetle. Fuller understanding of the phenomenon awaits further study.},

	abstract = {The emission profile of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitric oxide (NO) in young and mature leaves of Croton floribundus was assessed in plants exposed to filtered air (FA) and ozone-enriched filtered air (FA+O-3). After the period of exposure, leaves were enclosed in polyethylene terephthalate bags and VOCs were collected in young and mature leaves. Both young and mature leaves constitutively emitted the same VOC, but the concentrations were higher in young leaves. O-3 exposure induced the emission of sesquiterpenes (mainly beta-caryophyllene) known as antioxidant compounds that may scavenge O-3. Young leaves were the highest emitters of sesquiterpenes. O-3 induced a rapid accumulation of NO in different tissues and leaf developmental stages; this accumulation was marked in palisade and spongy parenchyma cells in young and mature leaves, respectively. O-3 altered the levels of the signaling compound methyl salicylate (MeSA). Moreover, our data showed that NO together with VOC emissions, such as geranyl acetate, alpha-cadiene, trans-farnesol, cis-beta-farnesene, and MeSA, participate of plant defense mechanisms against the oxidative damage caused by O-3.},

Here, we investigate whether the emission of VOCs from bracken fern Pteridium aquilinum is triggered by herbivory and if so - whether it is regulated by the octadecanoid signaling pathway. Interestingly, feeding of both generalist (Spodoptera littoralis) and specialist (Strongylogaster multifasciata) herbivores as well as application of singular and continuous mechanical wounding of fronds induced only very low levels of VOC emission. In contrast, treatment with jasmonic acid (JA) led to the emission of a blend of VOCs that was mainly comprised of terpenoids. Likewise, treatment with the JA precursor 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and alpha-linolenic acid also induced VOC emission, albeit to a lower intesity than the JA treatment. Accumulation of endogenous JA was low in mechanically wounded fronds and these levels were unaffected by the application of oral secretions from both generalist or specialist herbivores. The emission of terpenoids upon JA treatment could be blocked with fosmidomycin and mevinolin, which are inhibitors of the MEP- and MVA pathways, respectively. These results indicate that similar to higher plants, terpenoid VOCs are produced via these pathways in bracken fern and that these pathways are JA-responsive. However, the very low amounts of terpenoids released after herbivory or mechanical damage are in stark contrast to what is known from higher plants. We speculate that S. multifasciata and S. littoralis feeding apparently did not induce the threshold levels of JA required for activating the MEP and MVA pathways and the subsequent volatile emission in bracken fern.},

	abstract = {Methyl salicylate (MeSA) is a long-distance signal transduction chemical that plays an important role in plant responses to abiotic stress and herbivore and pathogen attacks. However, it is unclear how photosynthesis and elicitation of plant volatile organic compounds (VOC) from different metabolic pathways respond to the dose of MeSA. We applied different MeSA concentrations (0-50 mM) to study how exogenous MeSA alters VOC profiles of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) leaves from application through recovery (0.5-23 h). Methyl salicylate application significantly reduced net assimilation rate in 10 mM and 20 mM MeSA-treated plants. No significant effects of MeSA were observed on the stomatal conductance at any MeSA concentration. Methyl salicylate elicited emissions of benzenoids (BZ), monoterpenes (MT) and fatty acid derived compounds (LOX products). Emission rates of BZ were positively, but emission rates of MT were negatively correlated with MeSA concentration. Total emission of LOX products was not influenced by MeSA concentration. Emission rate of MT was negatively correlated with BZ and the share of MT in the total emission blend decreased and the share of BZ increased with increasing MeSA concentration. Although the share of LOX products was similar across MeSA treatments, some LOX products responded differently to MeSA concentration, ultimately resulting in unique VOC blends. Overall, this study demonstrates inverse responses of MT and BZ to different MeSA doses such that plant defense mechanisms induced by lower MeSA doses mainly lead to enhanced MT synthesis, whereas greater MeSA doses trigger BZ-related defense mechanisms. Our results will contribute to improving the understanding of birch defenses induced upon regular herbivore attacks and pathogen infections in boreal forests.},

Previous studies indicate that the feeding damage caused by the herbivore Euschistus heros or the exogenous application of cis-jasmone in soybean plants induces the release of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) with a similar chemical profile and these compounds can attract the stink bug egg parasitoid Telenomus podisi (Scelionidae). Herein we tested in field conditions the effect of exogenous application of cis-jasmone in soybean plants on the parasitoid and stink bug community and on stink bug egg parasitism. In two areas, one within a soybean and another within a Crotalaria matrix, we randomly distributed 2 m(2) plots, with soybean plants induced (treatment, n = 5) or not induced by cis-jasmone (control, n = 5) in the field. We sampled the parasitoid community weekly with yellow sticky traps (n = 3/plot) and monitored parasitism with sentinel eggs of E. heros (n = 150/plot). We also monitored the population of stink bugs weekly, by sampling each plot with shake-cloth technique. The abundance of Scelionidae was highest overall and also in treated plots during the first four weeks in the area with a soybean matrix, but decreased thereafter. The richness of parasitoid families was similar between treatment and control plots in the area with a soybean matrix, but higher in control plots in the area with a Crotalaria matrix. Evenness was higher in control plots in the area with soybean matrix, whereas the reverse occurred in the area with a Crotalaria matrix. Results suggest that treatment with cis-jasmone effectively attracted and enhanced the population of scelionid parasitoids, but had no effect on the occurrence and intensity of parasitism and in the number of stink bugs.

	abstract = {Gas-chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) is a technique used in the identification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as pheromones and plant host odors, which are physiologically relevant to insects. Although pheromones often elicit large EAD responses, other behaviorally relevant odors may elicit responses that are difficult to discern from noise. Lock-in amplification has long been used to reduce noise in a wide range of applications. Its utility when incorporated with GC-EAD was demonstrated previosuly by chopping (or pulsing) effluent-laden air that flowed over an insect antenna. This method had the disadvantage that it stimulated noise-inducing mechanoreceptors and, in some cases, disturbed the electrochemical interfaces in a preparation, limiting its performance. Here, the chopping function necessary for lock-in amplification was implemented directly on the GC effluent using a simple Deans switch. The technique was applied to excised antennae from female Heliothis virescens responding to phenethyl alcohol, a common VOC emitted by plants. Phenethyl alcohol was always visible and quantifiable on the flame ionization detector (FID) chromatogram, allowing the timing and amount of stimulus delivered to the antennal preparation to be measured. In our new chopper EAG configuration, the antennal preparation was shielded from air currents in the room, further reducing noise. A dose-response model in combination with a Markov-chain monte-carlo (MCMC) method for Bayesian inference was used to estimate and compare performance in terms of error rates involved in the detection of insect responses to GC peaks visible on an FID detector. Our experiments showed that the predicted single-trial phenethyl alcohol detection limit on female H. virescens antennae (at a 5.0\% expected error rate) was 140,330 pg using traditional EAG recording methods, compared to 2.6-6.3 pg (5th to the 95th percentile) using Deans switch-enabled lock-in amplification, corresponding to a 10.4-12.7 dB increase in signal-to-noise ratio.},

Synthetic PV blends synergizing pheromone contain acetoin (A) and ethyl acetate (EtAc). R, A, and EtAc are detected by specialized olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In addition, particular types of ORNs are tuned to both A and R. To specify the role played by acetoin in pheromone perception, we recorded the responses of ORNs to 100 ng of A or R presented either separately or mixed. Behavioral responses to R, A, and EtAc were studied in a four-armed olfactometer and by field trapping. We screened 59 R-, A-, and AR-tuned ORNs by recording specific responses to odors presented either separately or mixed. Stimulations by blends elicited complex response profiles from the three ORN types: some gave synergistic responses, others were inhibited, and the remainder responded as though both odors were detected independently. Several gave either a weak or no response to a first stimulation by R, but responded clearly to a second stimulation after an intercalary stimulation by A. In the olfactometer, both sexes were more attracted to a blend of A + R (1 + 0.01 ng/sec) than to pure compounds, whereas EtAc did not enhance response to R. Pheromone-baited traps (1 mg/day) containing PV blends (650 mg/day) based on an ethanol/EtAc blend (1:1), plus either 5 or 10\% A, or a more complex reference blend, or sugarcane (natural pheromone synergist), caught similar numbers of weevils and about twice as many insects as a control ethanol/EtAc blend. Traps with only pheromone caught about 10 times fewer insects. Behavioral results support the role of acetoin as a pheromone synergist for R. palmarum, and electrophysiological data provide evidence of modulation of peripheral sensory responses to pheromone by acetoin. Sexual dimorphism was observed neither at the ORN nor at the behavioral levels.},

Semiochemicals provide a powerful tool for attracting bark beetles and associated predators, but the extent to which trap catches reflect actual population densities are poorly understood. We conducted field experiments in California during 2 consecutive yr to determine how attraction of Ips pini (Say) and its major predators to synthetic pheromones vary from each other and from attraction to natural volatiles emitted from colonized hosts. Synthetic lures consisted of different ratios of the (+) and (-) enantiomers of ipsdienol, the primary pheromone component of I. pini, with or without lanierone, an additional component that synergizes attraction in some populations. L pini was consistently attracted to either 3(+)/97(-) ipsdienol or infested host plant material. Lanierone had no effect on the attraction of I. pini. Coleopteran predators showed a range of responses, more of which coincided with I. pini. Temnochila chlorodia (Mannerheim) (Trogositidae) was attracted to infested host materials and all synthetic lures. Enoclerus lecontei (Wolcott) (Cleridae) preferentially responded to higher ratios of (+)-ipsdienol, and its attraction was strongly enhanced by lanierone. Enoclerus sphegeus F. was most attracted to infested hosts and exhibited a preference for (-)- over (+)-ipsdienol. Our results suggest that preferences of bark beetles and predators for bark beetle pheromones at the regional scale should be considered before deploying semiochemicals. These results are also consistent with a model of co-evolving responses to pheromones by predators and their prey. The roles of plant volatiles should be further investigated, both to improve monitoring programs and from an ecological perspective.},

	abstract = {Insect hyperparasitoids are fourth trophic level organisms that commonly occur in terrestrial food webs, yet they are relatively understudied. These top-carnivores can disrupt biological pest control by suppressing the populations of their parasitoid hosts, leading to pest outbreaks, especially in confined environments such as greenhouses where augmentative biological control is used. There is no effective eco-friendly strategy that can be used to control hyperparasitoids. Recent advances in the chemical ecology of hyperparasitoid foraging behavior have opened opportunities for manipulating these top-carnivores in such a way that biological pest control becomes more efficient. We propose various infochemical-based strategies to manage hyperparasitoids. We suggest that a push-pull strategy could be a promising approach to 'push' hyperparasitoids away from their parasitoid hosts and 'pull' them into traps. Additionally, we discuss how infochemicals can be used to develop innovative tools improving biological pest control (i) to restrict accessibility of resources (e.g. sugars and alternative hosts) to primary parasitoid only or (ii) to monitor hyperparasitoid presence in the crop for early detection. We also identify important missing information in order to control hyperparasitoids and outline what research is needed to reach this goal. Testing the efficacy of synthetic infochemicals in confined environments is a crucial step towards the implementation of chemical ecology-based approaches targeting hyperparasitoids.

	abstract = {The majority of volatile chemical measurements related to plant communication processes have been conducted at relatively small spatial scales. Relatively little is known about how volatile-mediated signalling functions at larger scales, such as large plant, ecosystem or region. To understand these issues, real-time measurement of volatile organic compounds (VOC), which has been successfully used in the atmospheric science community for almost two decades, is required. When VOCs and vertical wind speed are measured at sufficiently high temporal resolution, eddy correlation techniques can be used to provide direct information about the ecosystem biosphere-atmosphere exchange. These very fast measurements can reflect the true dynamics of the concentrations of key semiochemicals, which could otherwise be averaged out over longer time periods. Furthermore, they allow for direct measurement of their ecosystem net flux from a well-defined area, which enables a holistic understanding of a habitat's chemistry and physics. This chapter is intended to inspire chemical ecologists to view the bigger picture in chemical communication by applying real-time measurement approaches at larger scales. This chapter presents the principles of real-time measurements of semiochemicals by PTR-MS and the eddy covariance technique along with examples of their current and potential applications in field measurements.},

	abstract = {Pollination based on insect deception has been debated in the scientific community since it was first reported over two hundred years ago. A vast majority of deceptive syndromes occur within the orchid family. While many cheating flowers have been described and are well known, there are still many curious cases that need further investigation. One prime example of such a case is Cypripedium calceolus, known as European lady's slipper orchid. While the flower has been of interest to many prominent scientists for over a century, its pollination is still not fully understood. Both visual and olfactory cues seem to play an important role in pollinator attraction. In this study we focussed on the olfactory cues in order to explore their relationship (in future experiments) with floral visual cues, including the unique asymmetry of these flowers. Some of the plants' floral fragrances were used in Electroantennography experiments. Eleven chemical compounds were applied to the antennae of Bombus terrestris and Apis mellifera. Even though these species are not regular visitors of C. calceolus, we were interested to see whether there were common principles in their responses to the flowers' scent that might justify extrapolating to other pollinator species such as sand bees that get trapped in these orchids and fly out of the flowers afterwards with pollen smeared on their body. The results show that while both species react similarly to most of the odours, some of the tested acetates induced a significantly greater reaction in B. terrestris antennae. These acetates play an important role in bumblebee pheromones, but their relevance for the natural pollinators of C. calceolus remains to be confirmed to see whether chemical mimicry by these flowers is deliberately employed to attract pollinators.},

Virgin C. glomerata females were found to release an attractive as well as a repellent compound, which in combination arrest males on the natal patch, but after mating the females stop the production of the attractant and the males are repelled. The repellent compound was identified as heptanal, which was also released by males, probably reducing male-male competition on the natal patch. We also confirmed that the sex ratio of the emerging wasps can vary considerably among patches, depending on the relative quality of hosts and the number of females that parasitize a host.

We recently demonstrated cross-talk among the signaling components involving Ca2+, jasmonic acid and ethylene, which are altogether responsible for volatile terpenoid formation in Medicago truncatula. Herbivore-stimulated Ca2+ transients are an additional element that has an impact on the composition of the blend of terpenoids, whose biosynthesis depends on the jasmonic acid/ethylene pathway. The molecular diversity of the blend is expanded and modulated by the transcriptional regulation of terpene synthases, some of which are multi-functional enzymes producing a large set of sesqui-and monotepenes or precursors of C-11 and C-16 homoterpenes from different prenyl diphosphates. In this addendum, we discuss a new perspective on early events leading to terpenoid biosynthesis.},

	abstract = {Predators and parasitoids are known to exploit both plant volatiles and herbivore pheromones to locate their insect prey. However, the interaction of these chemical cues in prey location, and the implications of multiple sources of chemical cues to predator feeding breadth and tracking of herbivore counter adaptations, are less well understood. We evaluated the responses of three coleopteran predators to the pheromones and plant signals associated with two species of common bark beetle prey. Thanasimus dubius, Platysoma cylindrica, and Corticeus parallelus feed exclusively on the fauna within trees colonized by bark beetles. The predominant bark beetles in conifer forests of central Wisconsin are Ips pini and Ips grandicollis. The aggregation pheromone of Wisconsin I. pini contains ipsdienol, which occurs as (+) and (-) enantiomers, and lanierone, and the pheromone of I. grandicollis contains ipsenol. The major hosts of these bark beetles are Pinus resinosa, Pinus banksiana, and Pinus strobus, which contain monoterpenes as their predominant phytochemical volatiles. Monoterpenes by themselves did not attract predators. However, some monoterpenes significantly affected predator attraction to aggregation pheromones. Myrcene, and to a lesser extent 3-carene, reduced predator attraction. By contrast, alpha -pinene consistently enhanced attraction by all three predators to the pheromones of their Ips prey. However, the predators' responses were modulated by the stereochemistry of a-pinene, and these responses differed when confronted with the different pheromones of the two prey species. (+)-alpha -Pinene synergized predator responses to the pheromone of I. pini, whereas (-)-alpha -pinene synergized responses to the pheromone of I. grandicollis. This pattern occurred for all three predator species. Interactions between herbivore pheromones and host plant compounds may provide an important source of behavioral plasticity in predators, and facilitate their ability to track several cryptic species that are distributed across multiple plant species and that show semiochemical variation in space and time.},

Trichoderma spp. are common soil and root endophytic fungi that have been widely studied due to their capacity to produce antibiotics, parasitize other fungi and compete with deleterious plant microorganisms. The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, is a serious pest of numerous crop plants. In the field, Campoletis sonorensis female wasps parasitize S. frugiperda. Considering these scenarios, it is necessary to look for ecological alternatives for S. frugiperda biocontrol. The aim of this work was to investigate whether Trichoderma atroviride associated with maize roots as part of a multitrophic interaction affects the parasitism rate of C. sonorensis on S. frugiperda. We found that larvae from maize plants whose roots were colonized by T. atroviride were stronger parasitized compared with larvae from non-inoculated plants, indicating that the fungus enhanced the natural mechanism of parasitism. This was correlated with the presence of the low-molecular weight compound 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6-PP) released by T. atroviride from the belowground. A pharmacological test showed that 6-PP is an airborne signaling molecule that increased the parasitism rate of C. sonorensis on its enemy. This finding provides new insights into the chemical communication between fungi and insects, and likely represents an inter-kingdom signaling molecule. Furthermore, this study shows a novel role for Trichoderma in multitrophic interactions, and its secondary metabolites in pest control management, presenting an alternative for the biocontrol of S. frugiperda using the combination of T. atroviride and C. sonorensis instead of chemical insecticides.},

	abstract = {Cuticular compounds (CCs) that cover the surface of insects primarily serve as protection against entomopathogens, harmful substances, and desiccation. However, CCs may also have secondary signaling functions. By studying the role of CCs in intraspecific interactions, we may advance our understanding of the evolution of pheromonal communication in insects. We previously found that the gregarious parasitoid, Cotesia glomerata (L.), uses heptanal as a repellent pheromone to help avoid mate competition among sibling males, whereas another cuticular aldehyde, nonanal, is part of the female-produced attractive sex pheromone. Here, we show that the same aldehydes have different pheromonal functions in a related solitary parasitoid, Cotesia marginiventris (Cresson). Heptanal enhances the attractiveness of the female's sex pheromone, whereas nonanal does not affect a female's attractiveness. Hence, these common aldehydes are differentially used by the two Cotesia species to mediate, synergistically, the attractiveness of the main constituents of their respective sex pheromones. The specificity of the complete sex pheromone blend is apparently regulated by two specific, less volatile compounds, which evoke strong electroantennographic (EAG) responses. This is the first demonstration that volatile CCs have evolved distinct pheromonal functions to aid divergent mating strategies in closely related species. We discuss the possibility that additional compounds are involved in attraction and that, like the aldehydes, they are likely oxidative products of unsaturated cuticular hydrocarbons.},

We find that pollination, attraction of natural enemies of plant pests, aggregation pheromones, and mate attraction are likely to be affected. We review the scant literature on this topic and extend the hypothesis to include heretofore unexplored interactions. New research should investigate whether air pollution deleteriously affects populations of organisms that rely on scent plumes. Additionally, we need to investigate whether or not breakdown products created by the reaction of signaling chemicals with pollutants can provide usable signals, and whether or not there has been adaptation on the part of scent emitters or receivers to use either breakdown products or more robust chemical signals. The proposed research will necessarily draw on tools from atmospheric science, evolutionary biology, and ecology in furthering our understanding of the ecological implications of how air pollution modifies the scentscape.},

A blend of 10 volatile compounds, which all elicit a strong antennal response, attracts mated grapevine moth females from a distance, by upwind orientation flight. These 10 grape volatiles are in part behaviorally redundant, since attraction to a 3-component blend of beta-caryophyllene, (E)-beta-farnesene and (E)-4.8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene was not significantly different from the 10-component blend. Blending these three compounds had a strong synergistic effect on female attraction, and omission of any one compound from this 3-component blend almost abolished attraction. It was nonetheless possible to substitute the three compounds with the other grape volatiles which are perceived by the female antenna, to partly restore attraction. Several blends, of varying composition, elicited significant attraction. The observed behavioral plasticity in response to grape volatile blends probably reflects the variation of the natural plant signal, since females oviposit on different grape varieties, in different phenological stages.

Earlier reviews focused on studies of attractive host volatiles with respect to development of a trapping system and visual and contact phenomena in EAB mate finding. This has led to the development of an efficient trapping system for EAB, with attempts to optimise the range of variables in trap protocols, combining pheromone components, release rates, and combinations with host kairomones, as well as trap type, placement, height, and colour being taken into account.},

The adult female wasp lives only a few days, and must usually fly to a different tree than her natal tree to locate receptive figs. Trees in receptive phase often occur at very low densities. Reproductive success of both fig and wasp depends on transmission of a very strong signal by the plant. Some evidence exists for the role of olfaction in location of receptive hosts by fig wasps, but very little work has been done on the chemical ecology of host location and host specificity. Here the first experimental evidence is presented for long-distance olfactory attraction of wasps by volatile substances produced by receptive figs, and for short-distance or contact chemostimulation by host volatiles that elicit entry of the wasp into the fig. In studies using Ficus carica L., pentane extracts of receptive-phase figs attract the pollinator Blastophaga psenes L. from distances of at least 5 m in the held. Short-distance chemostimulation was demonstrated in laboratory bioassays. Pentane extracts of receptive figs, when painted onto the ostiole of non-receptive figs, elicit entry of pollinator wasps. Figs emit volatile compounds attractive to pollinating wasps only during the period of receptivity; pentane extracts of non-receptive figs are not attractive. A simple reliable procedure is described to compare the attractivity of different types of extracts (total, internal, and external extracts) and of different fractions, in the first step towards identifying attractant substances.},

Chemical ecology has addressed the role of information conveyance in intraspecific and interspecific interactions and has mostly concentrated on elucidating the identity of chemicals and their role in individual interactions of food webs. In addition, the role of infochemicals has been investigated in multitrophic interactions.Recently, several exciting developments have taken place. On the one hand, chemical ecologists more and more address molecular mechanisms underlying the production of infochemicals and the responses to the cues, such as signal - transduction and gene expression.

	abstract = {Yeasts form mutualistic interactions with insects. Hallmarks of this interaction include provision of essential nutrients, while insects facilitate yeast dispersal and growth on plant substrates. A phylogenetically ancient chemical dialogue coordinates this interaction, where the vocabulary, the volatile chemicals that mediate the insect response, remains largely unknown. Here, we used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, followed by hierarchical cluster and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analyses, to profile the volatomes of six Metschnikowia spp., Cryptococcus nemorosus, and brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The yeasts, which are all found in association with insects feeding on foliage or fruit, emit characteristic, species-specific volatile blends that reflect the phylogenetic context. Species specificity of these volatome profiles aligned with differential feeding of cotton leafworm (Spodoprera littoralis) larvae on these yeasts. Bioactivity correlates with yeast ecology; phylloplane species elicited a stronger response than fruit yeasts, and larval discrimination may provide a mechanism for establishment of insect-yeast associations. The yeast volatomes contained a suite of insect attractants known from plant and especially floral headspace, including (Z)-hexenyl acetate, ethyl (2E,4Z)-deca-2,4-dienoate (pear ester), (3E)-4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT), linalool, alpha-terpineol, beta-myrcene, or (E,E)-alpha-farnesene. A wide overlap of yeast and plant volatiles, notably floral scents, further emphasizes the prominent role of yeasts in plant-microbe-insect relationships, including pollination. The knowledge of insect-yeast interactions can be readily brought to practical application, as live yeasts or yeast metabolites mediating insect attraction provide an ample tool-box for the development of sustainable insect management.IMPORTANCE Yeasts interface insect herbivores with their food plants. Communication depends on volatile metabolites, and decoding this chemical dialogue is key to understanding the ecology of insect-yeast interactions. This study explores the volatomes of eight yeast species which have been isolated from foliage, from flowers or fruit, and from plant-feeding insects. These yeasts each release a rich bouquet of volatile metabolites, including a suite of known insect attractants from plant and floral scent. This overlap underlines the phylogenetic dimension of insect-yeast associations, which according to the fossil record long predate the appearance of flowering plants. Volatome composition is characteristic for each species, aligns with yeast taxonomy, and is further reflected by a differential behavioral response of cotton leafworm larvae, which naturally feed on foliage of a wide spectrum of broad-leaved plants. Larval discrimination may establish and maintain associations with yeasts and is also a substrate for designing sustainable insect management techniques.},

	abstract = {Soybean, the main crop of Argentina, has promoted spatial and temporal homogenization of the agricultural landscape accompanied by significant losses of biodiversity, along with increases in the use of chemical inputs. One of the possible solutions to overcome these effects is the diversification of the agroecosystem, avoiding the control of weed species that could act as attractants of beneficial insects and deterrents of herbivory, without compromising crop yield. The aims of this work were to evaluate the composition, abundance and richness of insect assemblages in different soybean-weed (Artemisia annua and Chenopodium album)-herbivory combinations and to determine the relationship between insect assemblages and volatile signals emitted by the different combinations. Two factorial experiments were conducted during two consecutive seasons under field conditions. Factors were: i) crop-weed combinations with five levels: pure soybean (PS), soybean + 2 A. annua plants m(-2) (2A), soybean + 4 A. annua plants m(-2) (4A), soybean + 2 C. album plants m(-2) (2C) and soybean + 4 C. album plants m(-2) (4C) and ii) herbivory with two levels: with (+H) and without (-H). Volatile signals were measured with an electronic nose and insects were sampled with pitfall traps located in the center of each plot. Different insect assemblages related to treatments were identified. Richness increased when soybean was accompanied by weeds. The proportion of non-herbivores was always higher than that of herbivores. In both seasons, the same sensors detecting volatile cues were the main explanatory variables of the insect data, being responsible for the separation of A. annua treatments from the others. Many non-herbivore species were attracted to A. annua and repelled by signals captured by these sensors and, on the contrary, many herbivore and non-herbivore species were attracted to those blends associated to PS and C. album. PS and C. album could represent a food source for herbivores and alternative food or host for non-herbivores. Herbivory was not a discriminant explanatory variable. This work highlights that insect assemblage varies according to different crop-weed combinations and their volatile signals. Considering the positive impact on insect diversity of some species currently considered as weeds, could be useful to design future agro-ecosystems in which the regulation of pests is accomplished by increasing the fauna of beneficial insects and, thus, reducing the use of pesticides.},

Floral displays are used to attract and manipulate pollinators' behavior to support plant sexual reproduction while rewarding the visitors with access to nectar and pollen. The plant-pollinator interactions use various semiochemicals as important communication channels for successful species interaction networks. Floral display and scents can also attract insect herbivores (in which case they act as kairomones). Consequently, semiochemical-color-based traps used for monitoring pest insects in crop fields often accidentally capture pollinators, and these interactions simultaneously affect pest monitoring, pollinator assemblages, and crop production in agroecosystems. An integrated interdisciplinary approach that would use inter- and intraspecific signals employed by foraging insects for predator's avoidance with the goal of deterring pollinators and beneficial insects from entering pesticide-treated fields is proposed. Specifically, it should be possible to reduce the bycatch of pollinators by pest monitoring traps if these trap lures also include the alarm pheromones of insect pollinators such as bees. In addition, other tactics for pollinator protection could include first the application of nonlethal repellants to fields that have recently been treated with synthetic chemical pesticides to deter pollinators' visitation. A second action would be to incorporate the results of comparative risk evaluations (pollinators vs pests) for botanical pesticides, as well as for synthetic pesticides. Finally, we urge that wild pollinator species be included in pesticide risk assessments, especially for new classes of insecticides. Collectively, these actions should integrate pest and pollinator management strategies.},

Plant volatiles facilitate the location of suitable hosts for feeding and oviposition, and may moderate responses to sex and aggregation pheromones. While mating has been shown to moderate behavioral responses to pheromones in a number of insects, little is known about the effects of mating on behavioral responses of insects to plant attractants, and even less is known about the mechanisms involved. In this study, mating was shown to decrease behavioral responses of the Colorado potato beetle to a host kairomone within 24 h, and attraction to the kairomone recovers only after 72 h. This decrease in responsiveness also occurs when only contact with the opposite sex is allowed; the effect is not observed with contact among individuals of the same sex. Peripheral olfactory responses to a component of the kairomone correlate with the observed behavioral responses and suggest involvement of antennal receptors in the behavioral change.},

The use of kairomones for biocontrol of insect pests has been of interest for several decades due to the fundamental importance of host-plant selection by phytophagous insects, as well as the potential of natural enemies to co-opt those processes in ensuring their own survival. Pest management efforts that enhance the effectiveness of natural enemies can reduce economic loss and negative effects of insect herbivory. However, biocontrol agents often are unable to manage the populations of insect pests satisfactorily, due to limited host-searching capacity and limited detection range of 'signals' from damaged host plants. Here, we discuss known successful examples of such semiochemicals, kairomones, and their ultimate potential for biological control. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

We have recently identified 12-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyljasmonic acid as the bioactive metabolite, leaf-closing factor (LCF), which induced nyctinastic leaf closure of Samanea saman. We demonstrate that leaf closure of isolated Samanea pinnae is induced upon stereospecific recognition of (2)-LCF, but not by its enantiomer, (+)-ent-LCF, and that the nonglucosylated derivative, (2)-12-hydroxyjasmonic acid also displays weak activity. Similarly, rapid and cell type-specific shrinkage of extensor motor cell protoplasts was selectively initiated upon treatment with (2)-LCF, whereas flexor motor cell protoplasts did not respond. In these bioassays related to leaf movement, all other jasmonates tested were inactive, including jasmonic acid (JA) and the potent derivates JA-isoleucine and coronatine. By contrast, (2)-LCF and (2)-12-hydroxyjasmonic acid were completely inactive with respect to activation of typical JA responses, such as induction of JA-responsive genes LOX2 and OPCL1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) or accumulation of plant volatile organic compounds in S. saman and lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), generally considered to be mediated by JA-isoleucine in a COI1-dependent fashion. Furthermore, application of selective inhibitors indicated that leaf movement in S. saman is mediated by rapid potassium fluxes initiated by opening of potassium-permeable channels. Collectively, our data point to the existence of at least two separate JA signaling pathways in S. saman and that 12-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyljasmonic acid exerts its leaf-closing activity through a mechanism independent of the COI1-JAZ module.},

	abstract = {Understanding the factors driving diet selection represents one of the main thrusts of contemporary foraging ecology. Many studies have focussed on nutritional factors and anti-nutritional factors (such as tannins) that may describe diet selection of generalist mammalian herbivores, but these often do not explain the observed feeding patterns. Alternatively, generalist herbivores may be influenced by the presence, diversity and/or concentration of toxins. Plant volatiles have been understudied, yet may play an important role in this context. We aimed to determine whether diet selection by African elephants is better correlated with the presence and concentration of toxic plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) than with nutritional or anti-nutritional factors. We also aimed to identify the specific aspects of the plant-odour profiles that were correlated with dietary selection, which could be used as a pre-ingestive cue for food selection. We found that elephant diet selection was not well described by crude protein, in vitro digestibility, tannin concentration and total polyphenol concentration. Instead, the best predictors of elephant diet choice were the number and absolute (total) emissions of potentially toxic volatile PSMs, specifically monoterpenes. Elephants avoided plant species that emitted a wider diversity of volatile PSMs, had higher total emissions, and higher numbers and emissions of monoterpenes. This suggests that PSMs with a high propensity to become toxins, such as monoterpenes, are likely a better indicator for elephant diet avoidance than nutritional or anti-nutritional factors. Moreover, we demonstrated that elephants can differentiate between food items based on odour alone, specifically volatile monoterpenes, suggesting that these animals are relying on specific volatile cues emitted from plants to direct their foraging choices prior to ingesting selected plants.},

Elucidating the function of individual plant volatiles will require more knowledge of their biosynthesis and regulation in response to external stimuli. By exploiting the variation of herbivore-induced volatiles among 26 maize (Zea mays) inbred lines, we conducted a nested association mapping and genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify a set of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for investigating the pathways of volatile terpene production. The most significant identified QTL affects the emission of (E)-nerolidol, linalool, and the two homoterpenes (E)-3,8-dimethyl-1,4,7-nonatriene (DMNT) and (E, E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT). GWAS associated a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter of the gene encoding the terpene synthase TPS2 with this QTL. Biochemical characterization of TPS2 verified that this plastid-localized enzyme forms linalool, (E)-nerolidol, and (E, E)-geranyllinalool. The subsequent conversion of (E)-nerolidol into DMNT maps to a P450 monooxygenase, CYP92C5, which is capable of converting nerolidol into DMNT by oxidative degradation. A QTL influencing TMTT accumulation corresponds to a similar monooxygenase, CYP92C6, which is specific for the conversion of (E, E)-geranyllinalool to TMTT. The DMNT biosynthetic pathway and both monooxygenases are distinct from those previously characterized for DMNT and TMTT synthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting independent evolution of these enzymatic activities.},

We investigated the responses of two spiders to phytochemical cues that they potentially experience while hunting on leaves or flowers, and how these cues could influence their decisions where to forage. We compared the behavior of two sit-and-wait predators, Pisaura mirabilis and Misumena vatia, which hunt predominantly in the vegetation or on flowers, respectively. In choice tests, P. mirabilis frequently preferred leaves and leaf extracts to flowers and floral extracts and avoided substrates treated with the common floral scents P-caryophyllene and nerolidol (sesquiterpenes) in natural concentrations. In contrast, M. vatia did not show any preferences for any of the substrates and treatments offered. The lack of responses by M. vatia contrasts with earlier studies on another crab spider species (Thomisus spectabilis) that used phytochemical cues as a guide to rewarding flowers. The avoidance of many flowers, their extracts, and the floral scent compounds by P. mirabilis suggests that these cues may prevent the visitation by this and other generalised predators that potentially decrease the pollination success of a plant.},

Undomesticated cucurbit species are fast-growing annual vines and are commonly found in areas prone to disturbance such as riverbanks or roadsides. Cultivated varieties such as squash, pumpkins, gourds, cucumbers and melons rank among the highest acreage crops grown worldwide. As a result of their unique defensive chemistry and their ecological and agricultural importance, several wild and cultivated cucurbit species have emerged as models for studying chemically-mediated interactions among plants, microbes and insects. In this chapter, we provide an overview of research on the chemical ecology of the Cucurbitaceae and focus on wild and cultivated Cucurbita pepo (pumpkin, squash and gourds) and cultivated Cucumis sativus (cucumber). We explore how secondary metabolites, foliar volatiles and floral volatiles mediate interactions with antagonists (insect herbivores that damage plants and transmit pathogens) and mutualists (specialist pollinators and herbivore natural enemies) and discuss more recent work on the influence of beneficial and pathogenic microbes on these chemical signals. Collectively, this research demonstrates the potential of wild and agricultural cucurbit systems to provide key insights into the ways that chemical signals and cues play a role in plant-insect interactions and in the epidemiology of vector transmitted pathogens. Finally, we provide a perspective on the promise of the Cucurbitaceae as ecological models for translating plant chemical ecology research from controlled laboratory settings to more diverse, ecologically relevant field environments.},

	abstract = {In nursery pollination mutualisms, where pollinators reproduce within the inflorescence they pollinate, floral scents often play a major role in advertizing host location and rewards for the pollinator. However, chemical messages emitted by the plant that are responsible for the encounter of mutualist partners can also be used by parasites of these mutualisms to locate their host. Each species of Ficus (Moraceae) is involved in an obligatory nursery pollination mutualism with usually one pollinating fig wasp (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea: Agaonidae). In this interaction, volatile compounds emitted by receptive figs are responsible for the attraction of their specific pollinator. However, a large and diverse community of non-pollinating chalcidoid wasps can also parasitize this mutualism. We investigated whether the chemical message emitted by figs to attract their pollinator can promote the host specificity of non-pollinating fig wasps. We analysed the volatile compounds emitted by receptive figs of three sympatric Ficus species, namely, Ficus hispida L., Ficus racemosa L., and Ficus tinctoria G. Forster, and tested the attraction of the pollinator of F. hispida (Ceratosolen solmsi marchali Mayr), and of one species of non-pollinating fig wasp [Philotrypesis pilosa Mayr (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea: Pteromalidae)] to scents emitted by receptive figs of these three Ficus species. Analysis of the volatile compounds emitted by receptive figs revealed that the three Ficus species could be clearly distinguished by their chemical composition. Behavioural bioassays performed in a Y-tube olfactometer showed that both pollinator and parasite were attracted only by the specific odour of F. hispida. These results suggest that the use by non-pollinating fig wasps of a specific chemical message produced by figs could limit host shifts by non-pollinating fig wasps.},

Use of Arabidopsis provides a unique possibility to study signal transduction by use of signalling mutants, which so far has not been exploited in studies on indirect plant defence. In the present study it was demonstrated that jar1-1 and npr1-1 mutants are not affected in caterpillar (Pieris rapae)-induced attraction of the parasitoid Cotesia rubecula. Both JAR1 and NPR1 ( also known as NIM1) are involved in signalling downstream of JA in induced defence against pathogens such as induced systemic resistance (ISR). NPR1 is also involved in signalling downstream of SA in defence against pathogens such as systemic acquired resistance (SAR). These results demonstrate that signalling downstream of JA and SA differs between induced indirect defence against herbivores and defence against pathogens such as SAR and ISR. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that herbivore-derived elicitors are involved in induced attraction of the parasitoid Cotesia rubecula.},

	abstract = {The tea aphid, Toxoptera aurantii (Boyer), aggregates, pierces and sucks the sap of the tea shoots. The chemical control is not practical and restricted, since the tender tea shoots are commonly used for producing quality tea leaves. The green lacewing, Chrysopa septempunctata Wesmael, is one of the most important natural enemies of the tea aphid. However, the effectiveness of using this predator to suppress tea aphid populations is limited by their dispersal behavior and inefficiency of prey search. Here, we proposed a new strategy for enhancing the biological control against the volatiles were collected from aphid-damaged tea shoots and intact tea shoots by the headspace sampling technique, and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. (E) -2-pentenal, benzaldehyde and a-famesene were identified as three dominant volatile components, followed by other 13 compounds from aphid-damaged tea shoots. EAG responses by the lacewing antennae were tested on the 16 synthetic individual compounds identified from aphid-damaged tea shoots, the two known aphid sex pheromone components (nepetalactone and nepetalactol), and a synthetic mixture containing a-famesene, benzaldehyde and nepetalactol at ratio of 2:2:6, at 200 vtg loading dosage for each tested compound or mixture. Nepetalactol, nepetalactone, a-farnesene, (E) -2-pentenal and benzaldehyde elicited higher EAG responses than did the other identified volatile components. However; the highest lacewing EAG response was observed to the synthetic mixture of a-famesene, benzaldehyde and nepetalactol. This synthetic blend, aphid sex-pheromone, nepetalactone and nepetalactol, blends at seven different ratios (10: 0, 9: 1, 7.5: 2.5, 5: 5, 2.5:7.5, 1: 9, 0: 10), (Z) -3 -hexen-1-ol, (E) -2pentenal, (E) -2-hexenal, benzaldehyde and a farnesene, each at 10.mg dosage, were tested in the field. Our field trapping results showed that the synthetic blend of a-famesene, benzaldehyde and nepetalactol was the most attractive to C. septempunctata adults, followed by nepetalactol alone and the binary blend of nepetalactone and nepetalactol at 1:9 ratio, which caught more lacewings than did the other ratios of the pheromone binary blends or other individual plant volatile compounds. During the field observations, we also found that the lacewing adults were not only attracted to lure-baited tea plants to directly prey on aphids, but also oviposited to raise their larva overwintering population in the habitat with plenty of overwintering aphid eggs. The deployment of lacewing attractant lures on tea plants may provide a unique, novel, and non-traditional control strategy against the economically important tea aphids.},

	abstract = {Background: Insect predators and parasitoids exploit attractive chemical signals from lower trophic levels as kairomones to locate their herbivore prey and hosts. We hypothesized that specific chemical cues from prey non-hosts and non-habitats, which are not part of the trophic chain, are also recognized by predators and would inhibit attraction to the host/prey kairomone signals. To test our hypothesis, we studied the olfactory physiology and behavior of a predaceous beetle, Thanasimus formicarius (L.) (Coleoptera: Cleridae), in relation to specific angiosperm plant volatiles, which are non-host volatiles (NHV) for its conifer-feeding bark beetle prey.Methodology/Principal Findings: Olfactory detection in the clerid was confirmed by gas chromatography coupled to electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) for a subset of NHV components. Among NHV, we identified two strongly antennally active molecules, 3-octanol and 1-octen-3-ol. We tested the potential inhibition of the combination of these two NHV on the walking and flight responses of the clerid to known kairomonal attractants such as synthetic mixtures of bark beetle (Ips spp.) aggregation pheromone components (cis-verbenol, ipsdienol, and E-myrcenol) combined with conifer (Picea and Pinus spp.) monoterpenes (alpha-pinene, terpinolene, and Delta(3)-carene). There was a strong inhibitory effect, both in the laboratory (effect sized = -3.2, walking bioassay) and in the field (d = -1.0, flight trapping). This is the first report of combining antennal detection (GC-EAD) and behavioral responses to identify semiochemical molecules that bypass the trophic system, signaling habitat information rather than food related information.Conclusions/Significance: Our results, along with recent reports on hymenopteran parasitoids and coleopteran predators, suggest that some NHV chemicals for herbivores are part of specific behavioral signals for the higher trophic level and not part of a background noise. Such bypass-trophic signals could be of general importance for third trophic level players in avoiding unsuitable habitats with non-host plants of their prey.},

Using beet armyworm caterpillars (BAW: Spodoptera exigua) and intact corn seedlings, we examine this hypothesis by measuring both the time-course of insect-induced JA levels and the relationships between endogenous JA levels, ethylene, indole and sesquiterpenes. In separate Morning and Evening time-course trials, BAW feeding stimulated increases in JA levels within the first 4-6 h and resulted in maximal increases in JA, indole, sesquiterpenes and ethylene 8-16 h later. During BAW herbivory, increases in JA either paralleled or preceded the increases in indole, sesquiterpenes and ethylene in the Morning and Evening trials, respectively. By varying the intensity of the BAW herbivory, we demonstrate that strong positive relationships exist between the resulting variation in insect-induced JA levels and volatile emissions such as indole and the sesquiterpenes. To address potential signaling interactions between herbivore-induced JA and ethylene, plants were pretreated with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), an inhibitor of ethylene perception. 1-MCP pretreatment resulted in reduced production of ethylene and volatile emission following BAW herbivory but did not alter the insect-induced accumulation of JA. Our results strongly support a role for JA in the regulation of insect-induced volatile emission but also suggest that ethylene perception regulates the magnitude of volatile emission during herbivory.},

	abstract = {Herbivore insects use a broad range of chemical cues to locate their host to feed or to oviposit. Whether several plant volatiles are effective allelochemicals for insects, the latter also emit molecules which have infochemical role. The (E)-beta-farnesene (EBF) is a well-known aphid alarm pheromone commonly found in all previously tested species. Analysis of the released molecules from 23 aphid species, mainly collected on their natural host plant from May to July, was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. While EBF was identified as the main volatile substance in 16 species, alone or associated with other molecules, the alarm pheromone was only a minor component of the volatile molecule pattern of five other species. Moreover, two species, Euceraphis punctipennis and Drepanosiphum platanoides, did not release EBF at all but other terpenes were identified. This original observation raised the question on the utility and the source of the non-EBF volatiles. Are these potential infochemical substances produced by the aphid or only absorbed from the host plant? Here we determined that terpenes released by insects were not only provided by the host plants. Indeed, Megoura viciae emitted additional molecules than the ones from several aphid species reared on the same host plant. Moreover, no systematic relation between the feeding behaviour of the aphid species and the volatile releases was observed. Aphid terpene composition and proportion would provide reliable cues to identify the emitting organism, plant or insect. The next step of this work will be to determine the infochemical role of terpenes found in the range of tested aphid samples to better understand the relations between the different tritrophic levels.},

[Methods] The expression levels of AipsCSP8 in the head, thorax, abdomen, leg, wing, pheromone gland (accessory gland), antenna, proboscis and labial palp of adults of A. ipsilon and the antennae of adults before and after emergence were determined by qRT-PCR. The recombinant protein AipsCSP8 was harvested by in vitro prokaryotic expression system, and its binding characteristics to 24 sex pheromones, 22 plant volatiles and 10 chemical pesticides were determined by fluorescence binding assay. [Results] The qRT-PCR results indicated that the expression level of AipsCSP8 was the highest in the leg and labial palp of male adults, followed by in the accessory gland and the antenna of male adults. While in female adults, the expression level of AipsCSP8 was the highest in the antenna, followed by in the leg, pheromone gland and labial palp. In addition, the expression levels of AipsCSP8 in the antennae of males and females reached the peak on the 1st day befbre emergence and on the day of emergence, respectively. The results of fluorescence competitive binding assay showed that AipsCSP8 had strong binding capabilities with dibutyl phthalate, phenylacetaldehyde and avermectin, with the dissociation constant K-i values of 14. 6, 17. 2 and 12.9 mu mol/L, respectively. [Conclusion] AipsCSP8 may be involved in the olfactory behavior and taste recognition of A. ipsilon and play a role in the perception of chemical pesticides.},

Aldehyde was found to be the most abundant VOC category in the present study and (E)-beta-ionone was the only compound found to exist in all seven seaweeds. The chemical diversity of aldehydes in E. prolifera suggest its potential application in chemotaxonomy and hinted that divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) fiber is more suitable for aldehyde extraction. VOCs in D. dichotoma were characterized as sesquiterpenes and diterpenes and the most relevant pharmacological pathway was the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, which suggests that D. dichotoma may have certain preventive and therapeutic values in cancer, especially in lung cancer, in addition to neuropsychiatric diseases.},

The blends plus rhynchophorol also attracted the related Dynamis borassi. Ethanol-ethyl acetate blends in various ratios showed moderate synergy. Two blends, including "characteristic coconut" odor molecules, were as efficient as sugarcane in synergizing rhynchophorol and field luring American Palm weevils (APWs). Preliminary olfactometer tests of natural host-plant volatiles demonstrated the role of fermentation in primary APW attraction. The synergists were chosen from a comparative study of the odors emitted by four plant materials attractive to the APW: sugarcane, coconut, Jacaratia digitata tree and Elaeis guineensis (Oil palm). The volatiles were isolated during 6 days of sequential trappings onto Supelpak-2 adsorbent. The highly volatile fraction of sugarcane volatiles was sampled by solid-phase microextraction (SPME). Odors were analyzed and identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Electroantennogram responses to the plant odors were recorded to help in screening for bioactivity. The odor compositions between plants prior to and during fermentation were compared using a principal component analysis (PCA) to determine common odor features of the plants and to design simplified blends for field activity screening. About 100 components were identified in the {\textgreater}4-carbon fraction of the odors, among which 65\% were fermentation volatiles. Fermentation generated a strong increase in the amount and variety of the volatiles emitted. The palm materials emitted two- to threefold greater odor amounts than the other plants. The odors from each plant were distinct according to PCA, with few common abundant components: isopentanol, 2-methylbutanol, their acetates, acetoin, isobutyl acetate, 2,3-butanediol, and 2-phenylethanol. Ethanol and ethyl acetate accounted for 80-90\% in the highly volatile fraction of sugarcane odors. Coconut odor was mainly characterized by phenol, guaiacol, 1,2-dimethoxybenzene, ethyl esters of tiglic and 3,3-dimethylacrylic acids, 2-hexanone, 2-nonanone; and, to a lesser extent, by 2-heptanone, menthone, beta-phellandrene, ethyl octanoate and decanoate, which were also present in other plants.},

In contrast to model plants, reports on HIPV formation and function in crops are limited. Tea (Camellia sinensis) is an important crop in China. alpha -Farnesene is a common HIPV produced in tea plants in response to different herbivore attacks. In this study, a C. sinensis alpha -farnesene synthase (CsAFS) was isolated, cloned, sequenced, and functionally characterized. The CsAFS recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli was able to transform farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into alpha -farnesene and also convert geranyl diphosphate (GPP) to beta -ocimene in vitro. Furthermore, transient expression analysis in Nicotiana benthamiana plants indicated that CsAFS was located in the cytoplasm and could convert FPP to alpha -farnesene in plants. Wounding, to simulate herbivore damage, activated jasmonic acid (JA) formation, which significantly enhanced the CsAFS expression level and alpha -farnesene content. This suggested that herbivore-derived wounding induced alpha -farnesene formation in tea leaves. Furthermore, the emitted alpha -farnesene might act as a signal to activate antibacterial-related factors in neighboring undamaged tea leaves. This research advances our understanding of the formation and signaling roles of common HIPVs in crops such as tea plants.},

A statistic called linens age-skew (linear orthogonal polynomial) was used to examine differences in responses to potato volatiles between young and mature CPB. Based on plots of linear age-skew and overall neural responsiveness, 10 volatiles could be identified for which responses increased at a rate similar to or greater than the standard.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by flowers are used by flower visitors as olfactory cues to locate flowers, both from a distance and at close range. More recently it has been demonstrated that reactive molecules such as ozone can modify or degrade VOCs, and this may impair the communication between plants and their pollinators. However, it is not known whether such reactive molecules also may affect the olfactory system of pollinators, and thus not only influence signal transmission but perception of the signal. In this study, we used electroantennographic measurements to determine the effect of increased levels of ozone on antennal responses in western honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Linalool and 2-phenylethanol, both known to be involved in location of flowers by the bees, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, a widespread green leaf volatile also detected by bees, were used. The results showed that ozone affected antennal responses to the different substances differently. Ozone decreased antennal responses to (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, whereas responses to linalool and 2-phenylethanol were not influenced by ozone. Overall, the study does not provide evidence that pollination by honey bees is impaired by damage in the olfactory system of the bees caused by increased levels of ozone, at least when linalool and 2-phenylethanol are the attractive signals. However, the results also suggest that ozone can change the overall perception of an odor blend. This might have negative effects in pollination systems and other organismic interactions mediated by specific ratios of compounds.},

The taxonomical and morphological descriptions proffered by researchers and the insect life cycle are discussed. The review lays emphasis on the chemical ecology of the interaction between Z. conferta, Aquilaria and associating microorganisms as a possible continuum operating in the form of complex chemical signalling via release and sensing of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), Herbivore Induced Plant Volatiles (HIPVs) and Microbial Volatile Organic Compounds (MVOCs). The review also scrutinizes the future perspectives of understanding the interaction in devising suitable management strategies to prevent uncontrolled infestation and, simultaneously, develop artificial rearing technology for the insect Z. conferta as a strategy for ensuring sustainable livelihood of farmers dependent on agarwood production.},

This indicated that our understanding of the chemical communication in this species is incomplete. Another male-specific sesquiterpenoid, (3S,9R, 9aS)-3-hydroxy-3,5,5,9-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-benzo[7]annulen-2(3H)-one (compound G), has been reported from an American P. striolata population. We confirmed the presence of compound G, and investigated its interaction with compound A and AITC in a P. striolata population in Taiwan. Compound G was attractive to Taiwanese P. striolata in laboratory bioassays, but significantly more beetles were attracted to a blend of compounds A and G. Under the same conditions, P. striolata showed no preference for the blend of A and G combined with a range of doses of AITC over the sesquiterpenoid blend alone. The sesquiterpenoid blend was tested further in field trapping experiments and attracted significantly more beetles than traps baited with compound A and ecologically relevant amounts of AITC. We conclude that A and G are components of the male-specific aggregation pheromone of P. striolata in Taiwan, and that the attractiveness of the pheromone is not reliant on the presence of AITC. Our results further indicate that the male-specific sesquiterpenoid blends differ qualitatively between the Taiwanese and American populations of P. striolata.},

Despite this rapid progress in elucidating the chemical ecology of the Cerambycidae, most research to date has focused on species from North America, Europe, and Asia, with almost nothing known about species native to Africa, Australia, and South America. Here, we report the identification and field assessment of aggregation-sex pheromones produced by adult males of Ambonus distinctus (Newman) and Ambonus electus (Gahan), two sympatric and synchronic cerambycid species endemic to South America. Analyses of headspace volatiles from adult beetles showed that these species share two male-specific components, (R)-3-hydroxyhexan-2-one, and lesser amounts of 1-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-1,2-propanedione. Headspace volatiles from male A. distinctus also contained a novel minor component, identified as 3-methylthiopropan-1-ol. Field bioassays were conducted in Brazil, testing reconstructed blends of the compounds produced by each species, as well as racemic 3-hydroxyhexan-2-one and 1-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-1,2-propanedione as single components. Both sexes of A. distinctus and A. electus were most attracted to traps baited with their respective blends. In particular, 3-methylthiopropan-1-ol synergized attraction of A. distinctus and appeared to antagonize attraction of A. electus, suggesting a mechanism to minimize cross-attraction between these two congeners. Nine other cerambycid species were captured in significant numbers during the bioassays, including Ambonus interrogationis (Blanchard), Amorupi fulvoterminata (Berg), Chrysoprasis aurigena (Germar), Itaclytus olivaceus (Laporte \& Gory), Neoclytus pusillus (Laporte \& Gory), Orthostoma abdominale (Gyllenhal), Sphaerion inerme White, Stizocera consobrina Gounelle, and Uncieburia nigricans (Gounelle). Males of some of these species were found to produce (R)-3-hydroxyhexan-2-one, explaining why they had been attracted to some of the lures tested in bioassays. However, males of other species produced compounds other than 3-hydroxyhexan-2-one or 1-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-1,2-propanedione. We propose that these species are exploiting the pheromones of other guild members to locate high quality hosts for their larvae.},

Here, we investigated differential host-searching behaviours shown by mated and virgin females in the solitary parasitoid wasp, Cotesia vestalis, in response to herbivory-associated chemical information from cruciferous plants infested by their host larvae, Plutella xylostella.4. Mated females showed a significantly higher flight preference for host-infested plants over intact plants, while no preference was observed with virgin females. Mated females also showed more intensive antennal searching and ovipositor probing behaviours to leaf squares with wounds caused by hosts than did virgin females. Furthermore, mated females stayed longer in host patches with higher parasitism rates than virgin females.5. These results indicate that mating status of C. vestalis females clearly influences their host-searching behaviour in response to herbivory-associated chemical information and patch exploitation. Female parasitoids seem to forage for hosts depending on their own physiological condition in a tritrophic system.},

We compared VOC emissions from five peach cultivars (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) and a wild relative (Prunus davidiana (CarriSre) Franch) that differ in their level (susceptible/resistant) and type (antixenosis, antibiosis) of resistance to the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer). Additionally, the kinetics of VOC induction in response to aphids was compared with that by mechanical wounding. Qualitative and overall quantitative differences among peach genotypes were found in VOC emissions that were mainly composed of methyl-salicylate, farnesenes, (E)-beta-ocimene and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene. Irrespective of the type of resistance, all resistant genotypes had increased VOC emissions upon aphid attack, while in susceptible genotypes emissions remained low. Emission increases were highest in the genotypes that express increased aphid resistance during second infestations, which had also the highest proportions of methyl-salicylate in their emissions. VOC induction by aphids proceeded slowly with a delay of several hours. Artificial wounding of leaves did not result in emissions of aphid-induced VOCs but caused an immediate burst of green leaf volatiles and benzaldehyde. We conclude that VOC induction in resistant peach cultivars is part of a general defence syndrome that is being avoided or suppressed by M. persicae in the susceptible genotypes. The induction likely involves an aphid-specific elicitor and (methyl)-salicylate in the subsequent signalling and regulation processes that should include gene activation due to the marked delay in the emission response. The results are compared with those of the literature and discussed in view of their ecological and environmental significance.},

The parasitic chalcidoid wasps associated with the species-specific and obligatory pollination mutualisms between Ficus spp. and their agaonid wasp pollinators provide a good model to study the functional organization of communities.2. However, communities of non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFWs) remain little characterized, and their functioning and evolutionary dynamics are still poorly understood.3. We studied the communities of NPFWs associated with the monoecious F. racemosa and the dioecious F. hispida. Associated with these two fig species are a total of seven wasp species belonging to three genera. These species present contrasts in life history traits and in timing of oviposition. The species studied are thus broadly representative of the communities of NPFWs associated specifically with fig-pollinator mutualisms.4. In our study systems, there is temporal segregation of oviposition time among members of NPFW communities.5. We tested the role of volatile chemicals in the attraction of NPFWs associated with these two fig species, and tried to determine if chemical mediation can explain the organization of the communities.6. We conducted odour choice tests using a Y-tube olfactometer. All the NPFWs studied were shown to use volatile chemicals produced by the fig to locate their host. Furthermore, the signals used by each species depended on the phenological stage of the fig they exploit.7. Results demonstrated that the pattern of oviposition results from the utilization of volatile signals produced by figs that vary in their composition at different stages of fig development. Thus, chemical mediation allows resource partitioning in the NPFW communities associated with fig-pollinator mutualisms, and suggests hypotheses to explain coexistence in other parasite communities.},

In this review, we focused on the emission patterns and potential biological functions of VOCs produced by grapevines in response to stimuli. Specific grapevine VOCs are emitted in response to the exogenous stimulus, suggesting their precise involvement in plant defence response. VOCs with inhibitory activities against pathogens and responsible for plant resistance induction are reported, and some of them can also be used as biomarkers of grapevine resistance. Likewise, VOCs produced in response to beneficial microorganisms and environmental factors are possible mediators of grapevine-microbe communications and abiotic stress tolerance. Although further functional studies may improve our knowledge, the existing literature suggests that VOCs have an underestimated potential application as pathogen inhibitors, resistance inducers against biotic or abiotic stresses, signalling molecules, membrane stabilizers, and modulators of reactive oxygen species. VOC patterns could also be used to screen for resistant traits or to monitor the plant physiological status.},

In contrast, obligate ant-plants like the Central American "Swollen-Thorn Acacias" are colonized by specialized ants, although an individual host can carry ant colonies from different species that differ in the degree of protection they provide. We hypothesized that hosts that associate simultaneously with various partners should produce rewards in a modular manner to preferentially reward high quality partners. To test this hypothesis, we applied JA to distinct leaves and quantified cell wall invertase activity (CWIN; a regulator of nectar secretion) and EFN secretion by these "local" (i.e., treated) and the "systemic" (i.e., non-treated) leaves of the same branch. Both CWIN activity and EFN secretion increased in local and systemic leaves of the facultative ant-plant Acacia cochliacantha, but only in the local leaves of the obligate ant-plant, A. cornigera. The systemic EFN secretion in A. cochliacantha was associated with an enhanced emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Such VOCs function as "external signals" that control systemic defense responses in diverse plant species. Indeed, the headspace of JA-treated branches of A. cochliacantha induced EFN secretion in both plant species, whereas the headspace of A. cornigera caused no detectable induction effect. Analyses of the headspace using GC-MS identified six VOCs in the headspace of A. cochliacantha that were not emitted by A. cornigera. Among these VOCs, beta-caryophyllene and (cis)-hexenyl isovalerate have already been reported in other plant species to induce defense traits, including EFN secretion. Our observations underline the importance of VOCs as systemic within-plant signals and show that the modular rewarding in A. cornigera is likely to result from a reduced emission of the systemic signal, rather than from a reduced responsiveness to the signal. We suggest that modular rewarding allows hosts to restrict the metabolic investment to specific partners and to efficiently sanction potential exploiters.},

	abstract = {Maize (Zea mays) emits volatile terpenes in response to insect feeding and egg deposition to defend itself against harmful pests. However, maize cultivars differ strongly in their ability to produce the defense signal. To further understand the agroecological role and underlying genetic mechanisms for variation in terpene emission among maize cultivars, we studied the production of an important signaling component (E)-caryophyllene in a South American maize landrace Braz1006 possessing stemborer Chilo partellus egg inducible defense trait, in comparison with the European maize line Delprim and North American inbred line B73. The (E)-caryophyllene production level and transcript abundance of TPS23, terpene synthase responsible for (E)-caryophyllene formation, were compared between Braz1006, Delprim, and B73 after mimicked herbivory. Braz1006-TPS23 was heterologously expressed in E.coli, and amino acid sequences were determined. Furthermore, electrophysiological and behavioral responses of a key parasitic wasp Cotesia sesamiae to C.partellus egg-induced Braz1006 volatiles were determined using coupled gas chromatography electroantennography and olfactometer bioassay studies. After elicitor treatment, Braz1006 released eightfold higher (E)-caryophyllene than Delprim, whereas no (E)-caryophyllene was detected in B73. The superior (E)-caryophyllene production by Braz1006 was positively correlated with high transcript levels of TPS23 in the landrace compared to Delprim. TPS23 alleles from Braz1006 showed dissimilarities at different sequence positions with Delprim and B73 and encodes an active enzyme. Cotesia sesamiae was attracted to egg-induced volatiles from Braz1006 and synthetic (E)-caryophyllene. The variation in (E)-caryophyllene emission between Braz1006 and Delprim is positively correlated with induced levels of TPS23 transcripts. The enhanced TPS23 activity and corresponding (E)-caryophyllene production by the maize landrace could be attributed to the differences in amino acid sequence with the other maize lines. This study suggested that the same analogous genes could have contrasting expression patterns in different maize genetic backgrounds. The current findings provide valuable insight not only into genetic mechanisms underlying variation in defense signal production but also the prospect of introgressing the novel defense traits into elite maize varieties for effective and ecologically sound protection of crops against damaging insect pests.},

	abstract = {Insect herbivore enemies such as parasitoids and predators are important in controlling herbivore pests. From agricultural systems we know that land-use intensification can negatively impact biological control as an important ecosystem service. The aim of our study was to investigate the importance of management regime for natural enemy pressure and biological control possibilities in forests dominated by European beech. We hypothesize that the volatile blend released from herbivore-infested beech trees functions as a signal, attracting parasitoids and herbivore enemies. Furthermore, we hypothesize that forest management regime influences the composition of species attracted by these herbivore-induced beech volatiles. We installed flight-interception traps next to Lymantria dispar caterpillar-infested young beech trees releasing herbivore-induced volatiles and next to non-infested control trees. Significantly more parasitoids were captured next to caterpillar-infested trees compared to non-infested controls, irrespective of forest type. However, the composition of the trophic guilds in the traps did vary in response to forest management regime. While the proportion of chewing insects was highest in non-managed forests, the proportion of sucking insects peaked in forests with low management and of parasitoids in young, highly managed, forest stands. Neither the number of naturally occurring beech saplings nor herbivory levels in the proximity of our experiment affected the abundance and diversity of parasitoids caught. Our data show that herbivore-induced beech volatiles attract herbivore enemies under field conditions. They further suggest that differences in the structural complexity of forests as a consequence of management regime only play a minor role in parasitoid activity and thus in indirect tree defense.},

Terpenoid pheromones have been identified from species in the tribes Acanthoderini and Acanthocinini native to North and South America, comprised of (E)-6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-2-one (geranylacetone), the structurally related 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one (sulcatone), and/or specific enantiomers or nonracemic ratios of enantiomers of the related compounds (E)-6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-2-ol (fuscumol), its acetate ester, (E)-6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-2-yl acetate (fuscumol acetate), and 6-methylhept-5-en-2-ol (sulcatol). Here, we present new information about the chemical ecology of six acanthoderine and acanthocinine species native to the eastern USA. The pheromone of Astyleiopus variegatus (Haldeman) previously was identified as a blend of (S)-fuscumol and (S)-fuscumol acetate, and we report here that geranylacetone is a synergistic component. Males of Aegomorphus modestus (Gyllenhal), Lepturges angulatus (LeConte), and Lepturges confluens (Haldeman) were found to produce similar blends composed of the enantiomers of fuscumol acetate and geranylacetone, whereas males of Astylidius parvus (LeConte) and Sternidius alpha (Say) produced both enantiomers of fuscumol together with (R)-fuscumol acetate and geranylacetone. Field experiments with synthesized chemicals revealed that species with similar pheromone composition nevertheless differed in their responses to individual components, and to various blends of components, and in how attraction was influenced by chemicals that were pheromone components of other species. Sulcatone and/or sulcatol antagonized attraction of some species to pheromones of the geranylacetone class, suggesting that there is an adaptive advantage in an ability to detect these heterospecific compounds, such as in avoiding cross attraction to other cerambycid species, as yet unknown, that use pheromones composed of both chemical classes.},

	abstract = {The chemical ecology of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), has been the subject of a worldwide research effort spanning five decades. The initial focus of this work was the characterization of codling moth sexual behavior and the identification of its sex pheromone, followed by the development of effective monitoring and management programs. Subsequently, a large body of work was dedicated to deciphering the chemical messaging systems that exist between both moth sexes and their apple host. However, it was from pear that a potent kairomone, pear ester, ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate, was discovered, and surprisingly from field studies in walnut. Pear ester over the last decade has been the basis for the development of a range of commercial products that impact larval and adult behaviors and reduce levels of fruit injury. A review of codling moth and behavioral-active apple volatiles, the discovery of pear ester, and the development of useful technologies is provided here. A recounting of this story provides some considerations for the reader. First, that single odorants from a host e.g. (E,E)-alpha-farnesene and pear ester and maybe not complex volatile blends that more thoroughly characterize a host odor, are fruitful targets to develop female attractants. However, practical concerns such as chemical stability and synthesis cost will limit the implementation of any discovery. Second, it is not clear what semiochemical evoked behaviors should be targeted to develop an effective lure, i.e. suitable host for sexual rendezvous, oviposition, or as a food source. Background odors from immature fruits and undamaged foliage are generally more dilute and less complex than from ripening fruits or damaged foliage. Thus, effective chemical signals need to be more intense and apparent to lure moths. Third, it appears that adding acetic acid to host plant volatile lures is effective in drawing moths into traps, perhaps as a short-range food cue. Fourth, it was a field bioassay with a pear volatile in a walnut grove that unveiled the power of pear ester. Only later did a series of physiological and molecular studies detail the evolved interplay of pear ester and sex pheromone in the brain of codling moth. It is possible that this more basic approach will in the future allow the purposeful discovery of new attractants which can aid pest management of tortricids and other pest species. But more likely, chemists and applied insect ecologists need to continue to identify, synthesize, and test the various semiochemicals that define the lives of insects.},

	abstract = {The pheromone components of many cerambycid beetles appear to be broadly shared among related species, including species native to different regions of the world. This apparent conservation of pheromone structures within the family suggests that field trials of common pheromone components could be used as a means of attracting multiple species, which then could be targeted for full identification of their pheromones. Here, we describe the results of such field trials that were conducted in nine states in the northeastern, midwestern, southern, and western United States. Traps captured 12,742 cerambycid beetles of 153 species and subspecies. Species attracted in significant numbers to a particular treatment (some in multiple regions) included 19 species in the subfamily Cerambycinae, 15 species in the Lamiinae, one species in the Prioninae, and two species in the Spondylidinae. Pheromones or likely pheromones for many of these species, such as 3-hydroxyhexan-2-one and syn- and anti-2,3-hexanediols for cerambycine species, and fuscumol and/or fuscumol acetate for lamiine species, had already been identified. New information about attractants (in most cases likely pheromone components) was found for five cerambycine species (Ancylocera bicolor [Olivier], Elaphidion mucronatum [Say], Knulliana cincta cincta [Drury], Phymatodes aeneus LeConte, and Rusticoclytus annosus emotus [Brown]), and five lamiine species (Ecyrus dasycerus dasycerus [Say], Lepturges symmetricus [Haldeman], Sternidius misellus [LeConte], Styloleptus biustus biustus [LeConte], and Urgleptes signatus [LeConte]). Consistent attraction of some species to the same compounds in independent bioassays demonstrated the utility and reliability of pheromone-based methods for sampling cerambycid populations across broad spatial scales.},

	abstract = {1. Mutualism between ants and honeydew-excreting hemipterans is ubiquitous in the ecosystem. It is widely accepted that ant tending facilitates the colony growth of hemipterans by protecting them from predators and parasitoids. However, few studies have explored how ant tending helps defend against natural enemies. 2. Ghost ant Tapinoma melanocephalum and the invasive mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis have a close mutual relationship. Previous studies have shown that ghost ant tending can definitely reduce parasitism and visit frequency of Aenasius bambawalei, the dominant endoparasitoid of P. solenopsis. However, the ghost ant workers seldom attack the parasitoids. It is still unclear how the ghost ant adversely affects parasitoids. This study explored the mechanism underlying the impacts of ants on natural enemies of the mealybugs. 3. Honeydew produced by P. solenopsis was an attractant to A. bambawalei. Parasitoids exhibited less searching activity, shorter longevity and lower parasitism when supplied with less honeydew. Aenasius bambawalei showed significant avoidance of pygidial gland secretions and visual cues of ghost ants. Parasitism in plants treated with 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, actinidine, and gland extracts was significantly lower than that in plants treated only with solvents (paraffin oil or double-distilled water). 4. It is concluded that honeydew consumption by ghost ants could negatively influence the performance of parasitoids. The pygidial gland secretions and visual cues of ghost ants also significantly inhibit the parasitism. These results may contribute to a better understanding of the regulation mechanism in ant-hemipteran-enemy interactions.},

	abstract = {Background Plants, though sessile, employ various strategies to defend themselves against herbivorous insects and convey signals of an impending herbivore attack to other plant(s). Strategies include the production of volatiles that include terpenoids and the formation of symbiotic associations with fungi, such as arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM). This constitutes a two-pronged above-ground/below-ground attack-defence strategy against insect herbivores.Scope Terpenoids represent an important constituent of herbivore-inducedplant volatiles that deter herbivores and/or attract their predators. Terpenoids serve as airborne signals that can induce defence responses in systemic undamaged parts of the plant and also prime defence responses in neighbouring plants. Colonization of roots by AM fungi is known to influence secondary metabolism in plants; this includes alteration of the concentration and composition of terpenoids, which can boost both direct and indirect plant defence against herbivorous insects. Enhanced nutrient uptake facilitated by AM, changes in plant morphology and physiology and increased transcription levels of certain genes involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway result in alterations in plant terpenoid profiles. The common mycorrhizal networks of external hyphae have added a dimension to the two-pronged plant defence strategy. These act as conduits to transfer defence signals and terpenoids.Conclusion Improved understanding of the roles of terpenoids in plant and AM defences against herbivory and of interplant signalling in natural communities has significant implications for sustainable management of pests in agricultural ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Simple SummarySince the widespread adoption of Bt cotton in the late 1990s, the green mirid bug, Apolygus lucorum (Hemiptera: Miridae), has become one of the most important pests in cotton fields and some other crops. To manage this destructive pest, Peristenus spretus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) has been tested in augmentative biological control. In this study, after cotton plants were damaged by different densities of A. lucorum, the behavioral responses of A. lucorum and P. spretus to cotton plants volatiles were evaluated, and the quality and quantity of volatiles from cotton plants were analyzed. The results demonstrated that HIPVs emitted by plants in response to A. lucorum could be influenced by the pest density and could be identified by P. spretus as a signal of the host. Our results would help understand how P. spretus plays a role in biological control against A. lucorum.Plants would release herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) to repel herbivores and attract natural enemies after being damaged by herbivores. In this study, after cotton plants were damaged by different densities of Apolygus lucorum, the behavioral responses of A. lucorum and Peristenus spretus to cotton plants volatiles were evaluated, and the quality and quantity of volatiles from cotton plants were analyzed. Only when cotton plants were damaged by four bugs did both A. lucorum and P. spretus show an obvious response to damaged cotton plants, which indicates that cotton defense is correlated with pest density. The collection and analysis of volatiles reveals that the increase in pest density results in the emission of new compounds and an increase in the total number of volatiles with an alteration in proportions among the compounds in the blend. These changes in volatile profiles might provide wasps and mirids with specific information on host habitat quality and thus could explain the behavioral responses of parasitoids and pests.},

	abstract = {Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), in addition to attracting natural enemies of herbivores, can serve a signaling function within plants by acting as wound signals that induce or prime defenses.  However, particularly in woody plants, which compounds within HIPV blends are capable of acting as signaling molecules are largely unknown.   Leaves of hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides x nigra) saplings were exposed in vivo to naturally wound-emitted concentrations of the green leaf volatile (GLV) cis-3-hexenyl acetate (z3HAC) and then subsequently fed upon by gypsy moth larvae (Lymantria dispar L.).  Volatiles were collected throughout the experiments, and leaf tissue was collected to measure phytohormone levels and expression of defense-related genes.    Relative to controls, z3HAC-exposed leaves had higher levels of jasmonic acid and ?-linolenic acid following gypsy moth feeding.  Further, z3HAC primed transcripts of phytohormone signaling (lipoxygenase 1) and direct defense (a Kunitz proteinase inhibitor) genes. These qRT-PCR results were supported by microarray analysis using the AspenDB 7K EST microarray containing {\textasciitilde}5400 unique gene models.  Moreover, z3HAC also primed the release of herbivore-induced terpene volatiles.   The widespread priming response suggests an adaptive benefit to detecting z3HAC as a wound signal. Thus, woody plants can detect and use z3HAC as a signaling cue to prime defenses before actually experiencing damage.  GLVs may therefore have important ecological functions in arboreal ecosystems. Plants and Gypsy Moths Hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides x nigra, clone "OGY": Magnoliopsida; Malpighiales; Salicaceae; Aigeiros section of Populus) saplings were grown from cuttings in a walk-in growth chamber maintained at 25oC with a 16:8 photoperiod. Cuttings were planted in five-gallon pots in commercial potting soil (MetroMix 250, SunGro, Bellevue, WA, USA) and watered as necessary. Due to supplements in the soil, fertilization was not required and poplars grew to heights of {\textasciitilde}1.5 m in 12-15 weeks.   Newly molted 4th instar L. dispar larvae were used for all experiments. Egg masses were obtained from APHIS (Otis Plant Protection Lab, Cape Cod, MA, USA) and reared through 3rd instar on artificial diet. Newly molted 4th instar larvae cleared their gut contents prior to molting.  Experimental Manipulations All experiments were conducted from March-April 2007 in a single walk-in growth chamber maintained as described above. Poplars were equilibrated to the chamber for 24 hours prior to manipulations.  Two fully-expanded source leaves (leaf plastochron index LPI 8 and 9) were isolated per sapling using individual 15x15x1 cm Teflon/glass chambers (for photo see Appendix in Frost et al., 2007). These two leaves are non-orthostichous, which means that they do not readily share assimilates or wound signals (Davis et al., 1991). Thus, for the purposes of these experiments, treatment leaves did not interact with their respective control leaves. However, the leaves are of slightly different ages and, to control for this potential effect, we randomized which leaf would receive the z3HAC treatment. Flow into each chamber was set at 2.0 L/min, which was sufficient to avoid condensation within the chamber. The experiments were designed to have two consecutive albeit separate treatments: exposure to z3HAC and subsequent application of L. dispar larvae. We used commercially available z3HAC (Sigma-Aldrich), and prepared concentrations to infuse into each septum such that it delivered {\textasciitilde}40 ng z3HAC per application. After a pretreatment volatile collection (Day 1 and night starting Day 2), z3HAC-infused rubber septa were placed into the leaf chambers with each treatment leaf (morning of Day 2). Control leaves each received a septum infused with just the dichloromethane solvent.  Septa were replaced twice, once before the afternoon collection on Day 2, and before the morning collection on Day 3. All septa were removed during the night of Day 3, since most volatile production stops at night in this hybrid (Fig 5a). On the morning of Day 4, two newly molted 3rd or 4th instar gypsy moth larvae were added to each leaf, regardless of whether the leaf received the treatment or control septa on Days 2 and 3. The herbivores remained on the leaves for {\textasciitilde}24 hours. On the day of collection, each leaf was excised at the petiole, photographed, and then placed in a labeled coin envelope and submerged directly into liquid N2. Each photograph also contained a standard of known area, from which leaf area and \% damage calculations were determined (Sigma Scan 500, Systat Software Inc.).  Larvae consumed similar amounts on the treatment and control leaves (24 hours: z3HAC-treated leaves: 4.7  1.8 cm2; controls: 4.3  1.7 cm2).  The snap-frozen leaves were stored at -80oC until grinding. Each leaf was ground in an individual mortar and pestle under liquid N2. Ground tissue was weighed into vials for RNA extraction and JA analysis (see below). Care was taken to not allow the ground tissue to thaw at any point prior to extraction. This method therefore allowed us to measure gene expression and JA from the same tissue. Microarray Analysis To explore a transcriptome-level response of poplar leaves to z3HAC and herbivory, we conducted microarray analysis of the samples collected after 24 hours of herbivore damage.  This allowed a comparison of transcriptome-level responses to herbivory in z3HAC-treated versus untreated leaves (i.e., the set of genes that were primed by z3HAC exposure).  Total RNA was labeled using Ambion's Amino Allyl Message Amp II aRNA Amplification Kit (\#AM1753) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, 1 ug of each sample was reversed transcribed using T7-oligo(dT) priming and subsequently second strand cDNA synthesis was performed. The resulting double stranded cDNA was purified and then used as a template for in vitro transcription during which amino allyl-modified UTP was incorporated. The resulting amino allyl-modified cRNA was purified and coupled with Cy3 or Cy5 (GE Amersham, \#RPN5661) as appropriate. We used dye swapping to account for potential dye effects.  Dye coupled cRNA was purified and 4 ug was fragmented and subsequently dissolved in 60ul of hybridization solution. We used an aspen 7K EST array containing replicate subarrays of 6,705 elements in a 4*4 grid with a spot diameter of {\textasciitilde}150 m and a spacing of 200 m (Ranjan et al., 2004).  The elements represented {\textasciitilde}5,400 unique JGI Populus gene models, and included positive and negative controls (Lucidea Universal ScoreCard, Amersham) to monitor target labeling and hybridization efficiency, as well as many genes of known function. Clone information can be downloaded from the aspenDB website (www.aspenDB.mtu.edu).  Arrays were hybridized following previously published methods (Xiang et al., 2002; Hughes et al., 2001).

	abstract = {Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) mediate communication between plants and insects. Plants under insect herbivore attack release VOCs either at the site of attack or systemically, indicating within-plant communication. Some of these VOCs, which may be induced only upon herbivore attack, recruit parasitoids and predatory insects to feed on the attacking insects. Moreover, some plants are able to eavesdrop' on herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) to prime themselves against impending attack; such eavesdropping exemplifies plant-plant communication. In apple orchards, the beetle Melolontha melolontha L. (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is an important insect pest whose larvae live and feed on roots for about 4years. In this study, we investigated whether the feeding activity of M.melolontha larvae (1) alters the volatile profile of apple roots, (2) induces the release of HIPVs systemically in the leaves, and (3) whether infested plants communicate to neighbouring non-infested conspecifics through HIPVs. To answer these questions, we collected constitutive VOCs from intact M9 roots as well as M.melolontha larvae-damaged roots using a newly designed rhizobox', to collect root-released volatiles insitu, without damaging the plant root system. We also collected VOCs from the leaf-bearing shoots of M9 whose roots were under attack by M.melolontha larvae and from shoots of neighbouring non-infested conspecifics. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that feeding activity of M.melolontha larvae induces the release of specific HIPVs; for instance, camphor was found in the roots only after larvae caused root damage. Melolontha melolontha also induced the systemic release of methyl salicylate and (E,E)--farnesene from the leaf-bearing shoots. Methyl salicylate and (E,E)--farnesene were also released by the shoots of non-infested neighbouring conspecifics. These phenomena indicate the induction of specific VOCs below- and above-ground upon M.melolontha larvae feeding on apple roots as well as plant-plant communication in apple plants.},

Biosensors are used for detection of volatile compounds often at a level of sensitivity unattainable by traditional analytical techniques. Classical biosensors and traditional analytical techniques do not allow an ecological context to be imparted to the volatile compound/s under investigation. Therefore, we propose the use of behavioral biosensors, in which a whole organism is utilized for the analysis of chemical stimuli. In this case, the organism detects a chemical or physical change and demonstrates this detection through modifications of its behavior; it is the organism's behavior itself that defines the biosensor. In this review, we evaluate the use and future prospects of behavioral biosensors, with a particular focus on parasitic wasps.},

Pollinator-mediated selection is often hypothesized to govern such polymorphism. For example, circadian rhythms of floral emissions have been associated to the daily activity patterns of pollinators in several plant species. However, most of the studies on floral scent variation usually consider only one factor of variation (diel variation, pollination, flower age ...). In this study, we investigated simultaneously seven sources of variation susceptible to induce changes in floral scent emissions in the food-deceptive orchid Orchis mascula: circadian rhythm, flower age, pollination, inflorescence morphology, herbivory, leaf spots and habitat. We found that all the factors studied, except plant morphology (spots on leaves, inflorescence morphology), were associated with significant changes in the volatile profile of O. mascula inflorescences. Electroantennography experiments with Bombus terrestris, the main pollinator of O. mascula, revealed that bumblebees were able to detect almost all the compounds involved in floral scent variation. Whether pollinator behaviour is influenced by changes in floral odours induced by these different factors, and whether it can affect plant reproductive success will have to be tested in further studies.},

	abstract = {Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is a sub-cosmopolitan species. Native to Asia, it has been released during the 20th century for classical and augmentative biological control of several herbivorous insects, mostly aphids and coccids. Despite its recognized positive impact on biological control, H. axyridis is now considered among the most dangerous invasive species in Europe and in most places where it has established. This is mostly due to its ability to reduce the populations of native predatory species of the same trophic guild. When exploring a new area, H. axyridis adults use semiochemical cues to acquire information about the habitat. Presumably, these cues are perceived by the sensilla located on the antennae. Surprisingly, in spite of the huge literature existing on H. axyridis, the antennal sensory organs have been poorly characterized. Here, we used scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) techniques to study H. axyridis antennae, with focus on the various types of sensilla and their distribution in male and female individuals. The presence of various classes of antennal sensilla belonging to the main types described in insects (chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, and thermo-hygroreceptors) was highlighted, as well as the widespread presence of antennal glands. The investigations showed some peculiar characteristics not known in Coccinellidae, such as the concentration of sensory structures at the level of the distal part of the apical antennomere and the discovery of antennal glands associated with it. No sexual dimorphism was revealed, neither for the general structure of the antenna (similar number of antennomeres and presence of modifications), nor for the total length and width of the antenna, the relative size of the antennomeres, the types of antennal sensilla, of their distribution and abundance. The potential relevance of these sensory structures and antennal glands, reported for the first time in Coccinellidae, is discussed in the context of intra- and interspecific communication.},

In this study, we found that predatory ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) patrolling Ficus racemosa trees were attracted to the odour from fig syconia at different developmental phases, as well as to the odours of fig wasps, whereas other predatory ants (Technomyrmex albipes) responded only to odours of syconia from which fig wasps were dispersing and to fig wasp odour. However, trophobiont-tending ants (Myrmicaria brunnea) patrolling the same trees and exposed to the same volatiles were unresponsive to fig or fig wasp odours. The predatory ants demonstrated a concentration-dependent response towards volatiles from figs receptive to pollinators and those from which wasps were dispersing while the trophobiont-tending ants were unresponsive to such odours at all concentrations. Naive predatory ants failed to respond to the volatiles to which the experienced predatory ants responded, indicating that the response to fig-related odours is learned. We suggest that predatory ants could use fig-associated volatiles to enhance their probability of wasp encounter and can eavesdrop on signals meant for pollinators.

	abstract = {In a tritrophic system formed by a plant, an herbivore and a natural enemy, each component has its own biological rhythm. However, the rhythm correlations among the three levels and the underlying mechanisms in any tritrophic system are largely unknown. Here, we report that the rhythms exhibited bidirectional correlations in a model tritrophic system involving a lima bean, a pea leafminer and a parasitoid. From the bottom-up perspective, the rhythm was initiated from herbivore feeding, which triggered the rhythms of volatile emissions; then the rhythmic pattern of parasitoid activities was affected, and these rhythms were synchronized by a light switch signal. Increased volatile concentration can enhance the intensity of parasitoid locomotion and oviposition only under light. From the top-down perspective, naive and oviposition-experienced parasitoids were able to utilize the different volatile rhythm information from the damaged plant to locate host leafminers respectively. Our results indicated that the three interacting organisms in this system can achieve rhythmic functional synchronization under a natural light-dark photoperiod, but not under constant light or darkness. These findings provide new insight into the rhythm synchronization of three key players that contribute to the utilization of light and chemical signals, and our results may be used as potential approaches for manipulating natural enemies.},

These species can be greatly affected both positively and negatively by modern forestry management practices, and should be monitored accordingly. Through headspace sampling, coupled gas chromatography-electroantennography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and field bioassays, we identified two compounds, 2-methyl-1-butanol and 3-hydroxy-2-hexanone, that constitute aggregation-sex pheromone attractants of three cerambycid species which breed primarily in different types of fresh, recently dead oak wood in Northern Europe: Pyrrhidium sanguineum (L.), Phymatodes alni ssp. alni (L.), and Phymatodes testaceus (L.) (Cerambycinae: Callidiini). Analyses of headspace volatiles collected from live insects indicated that the male-produced aggregation-sex pheromone of P. sanguineum is a 1-15:100 blend of (R)-2-methyl-1-butanol and (R)-3-hydroxy-2-hexanone, whereas the corresponding ratios for P. alni were 70-110:100. In field bioassays, adult P. sanguineum and P. alni were significantly attracted to multiple blends with varying ratios of the two compounds. When tested individually, the compounds were minimally attractive. In contrast, adult P. testaceus exhibited nonspecific attraction to both of the individual compounds and to different blends, despite the hydroxyketone not being part of its pheromone, which consists of (R)-2-methyl-1-butanol alone. Overall, our results suggest that a blend of 50:100 of racemic 2-methyl-1-butanol and 3-hydroxy-2-hexanone is appropriate for parallel, cost-efficient pheromone-based monitoring of all three species. In particular, these species could serve as useful indicators of how modern forestry practices affect a whole guild of saproxylic insects that require ephemeral deadwood substrates for successful breeding.},

Combinations of six bark volatiles (benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, trans-conophthorin, guaiacol, nonanal, and salicylaldehyde), three green leaf volatiles [(E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-hexen-1-ol,and (Z)-2-bexen-1-ol], and the nine compounds combined did not significantly reduce D. brevicomis response to attractant-baited traps. However, a significant effect was observed when the bark and green leaf volatiles were combined with verbenone. The nine nonhost angiosperm volatiles (NAVs) significantly augmented the effect of both release rates of verbenone, reducing trap catches to levels significantly below that of either release rate of verbenone alone. trans-Conophthorin, a compound reported to have behavioral activity in a number of other scolytids, was not critical to the efficacy of our NAV blend. Our results suggest that the addition of nonhost angiosperm volatiles to verbenone could be important for developing successful semiochemical-based management techniques for D. brevicomis.},

Plants can trigger specific responses to elicitors/effectors in insect secretions altering herbivore performance. Recently, maize chitinases present in fall armyworm (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda) frass were shown to act as effectors suppressing caterpillar-induced defenses in maize while increasing caterpillar performance. We investigated the effect of frass chitinase-mediated suppression of herbivore defenses in maize on the performance and preference of a subsequent insect herbivore from a different feeding guild, corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis). Aphid performance was highest on plants with FAWdamagewithout frass chitinases compared to damaged plants with frass chitinases or undamaged plants. Plant exposure to frass chitinases post FAW damage also altered the production of herbivore-induced volatile compounds compared to damaged, buffer-treated plants. However, aphid preference to damaged, frass chitinase-treated plants was not different from damaged, buffer-treated plants or undamaged plants. This study suggests that frass effector-mediated alteration of plant defenses affects insect herbivores asymmetrically; while it enhances the performance of caterpillars, it suppresses the performance of subsequent herbivores from a different feeding guild.},

We examined four caterpillar species representing two lepidopteran families for their capacity to decrease GLV emissions from Zea mays leaf tissue. We also investigated the source of the GLV modifying components in the alimentary tract of the various caterpillars. In Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Trichoplusia ni (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and Manduca sexta (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae), we found three distinct mechanisms to modify GLV emission: a heat-stable compound in the gut, a heat-labile enzyme in salivary gland homogenate (previously described in Bombyx mori (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), and an isomerase in the salivary gland homogenate, which catalyzes the conversion of (Z)-3-hexenal to (E)-2-hexenal (previously described in M. sexta).

Secretions associated with sensilla basiconica were observed for the first time in a cerambycid species. Conclusions: Sensilla basiconica should play a role in odor perception detecting host tree volatiles and/or pheromones. Sensilla basiconica type 1 and 2 produce a viscous material accumulating on the antennal surface. Chemical analysis of adult antennal secretions highlighted marked differences between sexes.

	abstract = {Signals given off by plants to alert predators to herbivore attack may provide exciting examples of coevolution among organisms from multiple trophic levels. We examined whether signals from mechanically damaged trees (simulating damage by herbivores) attract predators of insects along a complete elevational rainforest gradient in tropical region, where various predators are expected to occur at particular elevational belts. We studied predation of artificial caterpillars on trees with and without herbivorous' damage; as well as diversity and abundances of potential predators at eight study sites along the elevational gradient (200-3700 m a.s.l.). We focused on attacks by ants and birds, as the main predators of herbivorous insect. The predation rate decreased with elevation from 10\% d(-1) at 200 m a.s.l. to 1.8\% d(-1) at 3700 m a.s.l. Ants were relatively more important predators in the lowlands, while birds became dominant predators above 1700 m a.s.l. Caterpillars exposed on trees with herbivorous damage were attacked significantly more than caterpillars exposed on trees without damage. Results suggest that relative importance of predators varies along elevational gradient, and that observed predation rates correspond with abundances of predators. Results further show that herbivorous damage attracts both ants and birds, but its effect is stronger for ants.},

	abstract = {Plant defenses often mediate whether competing chewing and sucking herbivores indirectly benefit or harm one another. Dual-guild herbivory also can muddle plant signals used by specialist natural enemies to locate prey, further complicating the net impact of herbivore-herbivore interactions in naturally diverse settings. While dual-guild herbivore communities are common in nature, consequences for top-down processes are unclear, as chemically mediated tri-trophic interactions are rarely evaluated in field environments. Combining observational and experimental approaches in the open field, we test a prediction that chewing herbivores interfere with top-down suppression of phloem feeders on Brassica oleracea across broad landscapes. In a two-year survey of 52 working farm sites, we found that parasitoid and aphid densities on broccoli plants positively correlated at farms where aphids and caterpillars rarely co-occurred, but this relationship disappeared at farms where caterpillars commonly co-occurred. In a follow-up experiment, we compared single and dual-guild herbivore communities at four local farm sites and found that caterpillars (P.rapae) caused a 30\% reduction in aphid parasitism (primarily by Diaeretiella rapae), and increased aphid colony (Brevicoryne brassicae) growth at some sites. Notably, in the absence of predators, caterpillars indirectly suppressed, rather than enhanced, aphid growth. Amid considerable ecological noise, our study reveals a pattern of apparent commensalism: herbivore-herbivore facilitation via relaxed top-down suppression. This work suggests that enemy-mediated apparent commensalism may override constraints to growth induced by competing herbivores in field environments, and emphasizes the value of placing chemically mediated interactions within their broader environmental and community contexts.},

This study focused on the genus Tragosoma (subfamily: Prioninae).

We found the flight periods of T. harrisii and T. soror overlapped, suggesting that flight period is not being used by these two species as a mechanism to prevent inter-specific cross-attraction among their populations in Idaho. Our results increase understanding of the ecology of Tragosoma species, and the role of pheromones and flight period phenology in maintaining reproductive isolation, and will aid in development of lures for monitoring cerambycids.},

Host materials and extracts were often attractive on their own, and the attractancy was synergized when they were combined with the pheromone.  Propanoic and butanoic acids, methanol, 2-propanol, 1-heptanol, methyl butanoate, and propanal were among the most effective attractants relative to the pheromone, but many other compounds significantly synergized the pheromone (typically three-to four fold).  Attractiveness and synergism were influenced by the carbon chain length and branching of the substituents.  Straight-chain compounds that had at least three carbon atoms were generally effective as synergists.  Many branched-chain compounds were also effective synergists.  In general, the degree of attractiveness and synergism could be predicted fairly well with the physicochemical steric (Es) parameter, although the lipophilicity (Pi) parameter also appeared to be useful in explaining the lower activity of short-chain substituents.  Thus, many compounds that had only limited attractiveness on their own may nevertheless play and important role in synergizing the pheromone.  Structure-activity studies appear to be appropriate not only for determining optimal attractants for these insects, but also for determining effective synergists for the pheromone.},

Transcription regulation (including transcript processing) is pivotal for plant volatile terpenoid production. In this study, a terpene synthase gene CsLIS/NES was recovered from tea plants (C.sinensis cv. Long-Men Xiang). CsLIS/NES transcription regulation resulted in 2 splicing forms: CsLIS/NES-1 and CsLIS/NES-2 lacking a 305bp-fragment at N-terminus, both producing (E)-nerolidol and linalool in vitro. Transgenic tobacco studies and a gene-specific antisense oligo-deoxynucleotide suppression applied in tea leaves indicated that CsLIS/NES-1, localized in chloroplasts, acted as linalool synthase, whereas CsLIS/NES-2 localized in cytosol, functioned as a potential nerolidol synthase, but not linalool synthase. Expression patterns of the 2 transcript isoforms in tea were distinctly different and responded differentially to the application of stress signal molecule methyl jasmonate. Leaf expression of CsLIS/NES-1, but not CsLIS/NES-2, was significantly induced by methyl jasmonate. Our data indicated that distinct transcript splicing regulation patterns, together with subcellular compartmentation of CsLIS/NE-1 and CsLIS/NE-2 implemented the linalool biosynthesis regulation in tea plants in responding to endogenous and exogenous regulatory factors.Linalool and nerolidol produced in tea plants are not only airborne signals interacting against other ecosystem members for better plant fitness but also floral scent determinants of tea products. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying their biosynthesis in tea plants may provide effective approaches for tea aroma quality and tea productivity improvement. In this study, tea CsLIS/NES gene was found being differentially involved in linalool and nerolidol biosynthesis due to its 2 splicing transcripts with distinct expression patterns.

A test was conducted in a cave environment to assess whether E. larvarum displays a difference in locating and accepting the laboratory host Go Hello mellonella (L.) vs. S. litoralis and whether the host plant plays a role in host location by the parasitoid. Inexperienced E. larvarum females were similarly attracted to, and accepted. G. mellonella and S. littoralis larvae, but weakly responded to S. littoralis larvae feeding, on a bean leaf. Since the latter were apparently less mobile compared to the other two targets, the results may support the hypothesis that, at close range, tachinid females use visual cues and, in particular, motion signals in host location. Host acceptance and suitability of S. littoralis vs. G. melonella by P. larvarum were then further compared. Based on the time needed to obtain the oviposition of 4-6 eggs per larva, acceptance was not significantly different between the two host species. Puparia were however obtained from 1.3\% of S. littoralis larvae vs. 75\% of G. mellonella larvae. Despite the low successful parasitization, in parasitized S. littoralis larvae mortality was higher compared to control (unparasitized) larvae. This result suggests that E. larvarum may be a candidate for biological control of S. littoralis.},

Ectomycorrhizae had a systemic influence on jasmonate-related signaling transcripts. Our results suggest that ectomycorrhizae prime wounding responses and shift resources from constitutive phenol-based to specialized protective compounds. Consequently, symbiosis with ectomycorrhizal fungi enabled poplars to respond to leaf beetle feeding with a more effective arsenal of defense mechanisms compared with nonmycorrhizal poplars, thus demonstrating the importance of belowground plant-microbe associations in mitigating aboveground biotic stress.},

We performed experiments using Croton floribundus, a pioneer tree species that is tolerant to O-3 and widely distributed in the Brazilian forest. This species constitutively produces COC. We exposed plants to a controlled fumigation experiment and assessed biochemical, physiological, and morphological parameters. O-3 induced a significant increase in the concentrations of constitutive oxygenated compounds, MeSA and terpenoids as well as in COC number. Our analysis supported the hypothesis that ozone-induced VOC (mainly MeSA) regulate ROS formation in a way that promotes the opening of calcium channels and the subsequent formation of COC in a fast and stable manner to stop the consequences of the reactive oxygen species in the tissue, indeed immobilising the excess calcium (caused by acute exposition to O-3) that can be dangerous to the plant. To test this hypothesis, we performed an independent experiment spraying MeSA over C. floribundus plants and observed an increase in the number of COC, indicating that this compound has a potential to directly induce their formation. Thus, the tolerance of C. floribundus to O-3 oxidative stress could be a consequence of a higher capacity for the production of VOC and COC rather than the modulation of antioxidant balance. We also present some insights into constitutive morphological features that may be related to the tolerance that this species exhibits to O-3.},

	abstract = {Reliable large-scale maize production is an essential component of global food security; however, sustained efforts are needed to ensure optimized resilience under diverse crop stress conditions. Climate changes are expected to increase the frequency and intensity of both abiotic and biotic stress. Protective phytochemicals play an important role in both abiotic stress resilience and resistance to biotic challenges, yet the concentration and composition of these phytochemicals are also dependent on climate variables. We review the research on the effects of climate change associated abiotic stresses on three classes of maize defense metabolites, including benzoxazinoids, volatile organic compounds, and terpenoid phytoalexins. Despite significant knowledge gaps that still exist, it is evident that climate change will influence maize phytochemicals associated with resilient productivity. While broad generalizations are not yet possible, climate induced changes in phytochemicals are context specific and dependent upon developmental stage and tissue type. Under conditions of drought, maize modulates different classes of defense phytochemicals to protect the above-and belowground tissues. Aboveground the benzoxazinoid defenses are stimulated, but belowground terpenoid phytoalexins are predominantly deployed. Changes in the allocation or distribution of the different classes of defense metabolites or signaling molecules have the potential to further shape the biodiversity and abundance of pests within the maize agroecosystem. A better understanding of the underlying genetics, biosynthetic pathways, regulation and precise biological roles of maize phytochemicals modulated by arrays of climatic conditions will be required to ensure optimal plant resilience and productivity in the face of combined biotic and abiotic stresses.},

In insects, such cues are mainly chemical, derived from the host plant or the prey itself. The aphid alarm pheromone, (E)-beta-farnesene (EBF), is believed to be such a cue, because several aphid enemies are able to perceive EBF and show attractant behavior. These studies are, however, based mainly on electroantennogram or olfactometer assays, and often use unnaturally high pheromone concentrations. It is, therefore, unclear if EBF is used to locate prey in the field when only naturally released amounts are present. We monitored the frequencies and durations of plant visits by aphid natural enemies in the field using long-duration camera observations. By placing pheromone releasers emitting no, natural or exaggerated amounts of EBF next to small colonies of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum), we analyzed if EBF presence altered long-range foraging behavior of natural enemies. Thirteen potential groups of aphid natural enemies were observed in 720 hr of analyzed video data. There was no effect of EBF on the number of predator visits to an aphid colony, or on predator patch residence times. The number of plant visits increased at exaggerated EBF amounts but not at natural EBF levels. We conclude that while there may be potential for use of high EBF concentrations for agricultural pest management strategies, an ecological role of EBF as a kairomone in a natural context is doubtful.},

Fixed search images, however, may constrain predators and parasitoids, and render them ineffective at switching to new more abundant prey or hosts. For switching behaviour to be effective, parasitoids need to be able to learn cues associated with abundant hosts, and they need to be able to extinguish preferences for the cues of hosts that are no longer abundant. Here we use the Gryllus cricket and Ormia ochracea parasitoid fly system to show (1) individual consistency in fly preference for song in the field, (2) learning of host song in the laboratory and (3) that the flies' memory for learned host cues is very short term. These results are interesting and novel in several respects. First, our demonstration that O. ochracea satisfies each of the characteristics of an optimally foraging temporary specialist is new. Second, this is only the third demonstration of learning in the Tachinidae, a family of more than 9000 species, all of which are parasitoids. Third, the flexibility inherent in learning and host switching may have been instrumental in allowing expansion of the fly's geographical and host range.

The expression of several wound-inducible genes was suppressed after the application of OS from two lepidopteran herbivores, Pieris brassicae and Spodoptera littoralis. This inhibition was correlated with enhanced S. littoralis larval growth, pointing to an effective role of insect OS in suppressing plant defences. Two genes, an ERF/AP2 transcription factor and a proteinase inhibitor, were then studied in more detail. OS-induced suppression lasted for at least 48 h, was independent of the jasmonate or salicylate pathways, and was not due to known elicitors. Interestingly, insect OS attenuated leaf water loss, suggesting that insects have evolved mechanisms to interfere with the induction of water-stress-related defences.},

Such interactions might occur in the ocean because marine predators often use chemo sensory- based foraging, and herbivore-induced production of defensive chemistry is common in some algal taxa. To examine the ability of predators to find live herbivores using waterborne chemical cues from grazed algae, we tested the responses of marine predators to several baits using in situ trapping and video experiments. We tested the attractiveness of chemical cues released by (1) Macrocystis pyrifera and Ulva sp. actively grazed by herbivores for short-or longterm periods, (2) crushed herbivores, (3) positive controls containing fish carrion, or (4) negative controls. Most predators trapped and filmed were spiny lobsters Panulirus interruptus. Under realistic field conditions, chemical cues from actively grazed algae with live herbivores failed to attract predators, but chemical cues from crushed herbivores and fish carrion were highly attractive. Thus, while marine predators like lobsters may utilize fluid-borne chemical cues to find dead or injured prey, such cues appear less important for finding live herbivore prey. Our literature review of 142 terrestrial studies revealed that tritrophic cues were unrelated to diet breadth of predators or herbivores and that most examples of terrestrial tritrophic signaling contained parasitoid predators. We additionally found that similar field studies in natural, non-agricultural settings such as ours are lacking even in better-studied terrestrial food webs, where they represent only 3\% of manipulative experiments.},

	abstract = {Plant-lepidopteran interactions involve complex processes encompassing molecules and regulators to counteract defense responses they develop against each other. Lepidoptera identify plants for oviposition and exploit them as larval food sources to complete their development. In turn, plants adopt different strategies to overcome and limit herbivorous damages. The insect egg deposition on leaves can already induce a number of defense responses in several plant species. This minireview deals with the main features involved in the interaction between plants and lepidopteran egg-laying, focusing on responses from both insect and plant side. We discuss different aspects of direct and indirect plant responses triggered by lepidopteran oviposition. In particular, we focus our attention on the mechanisms underlying egg-induced plant defenses that can i) directly damage the eggs such as localized hypersensitive response (HR)-like necrosis, neoplasm formation, production of ovicidal compounds and ii) indirect defenses, such as production of oviposition-induced plant volatiles (OIPVs) used to attract natural enemies (parasitoids) able to kill the eggs or hatching larvae. We provide an overview of chemical, physiological, and molecular egg-mediated plant responses induced by both specialist and generalist lepidopteran species, also dealing with effectors, elicitors, and chemical signals involved in the process. Egg-associated microorganisms are also discussed, although little is known about this third partner participating in plant-lepidopteran interactions.},

We monitored the pollinating honey bee Apis cerana, as well as two occasional visitors-Vespa velutina and a Bombus sp.-and an herbivorous beetle Oxycetonia jocunda. Behavior experiments using Y-tubes showed that honey bees were attracted primarily by floral scent while hornets and bumble bees were repelled by both the flowers and leaves. Analysis via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that these tissue types differed in their compositions and relative amounts of volatile compounds. When the plants were damaged, the average relative amounts of Elsholtzia ketone rapidly increased in the flowers and leaves. Furthermore, herbivorous beetles were strongly repelled by damaged tissues, suggesting a potential defense signaling function by these compounds. Our findings again demonstrate that scents have multiple functions in the interactions among plants and insects.},

	abstract = {Pandemics of vector-borne human and plant diseases often depend on the behaviors of their arthropod vectors. Arboviruses, including many bunyaviruses, manipulate vector behavior to accelerate their own transmission to vertebrates, birds, insects, and plants. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this manipulation remains elusive. Here, we report that the non-structural protein NSs of Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus, a prototype of the  Tospoviridae  family and the  Orthotospovirus  genus, is a key viral factor that indirectly modifies vector preference and increases vector performance. NSs suppresses the biosynthesis of plant volatile monoterpenes, which serve as repellents of the vector western flower thrips (WFT,  Frankliniella occidentalis ). NSs directly interacts with MYC2, the jasmonate (JA) signaling master regulator and its two close homologs MYC3 and MYC4, to disable JA-mediated activation of  terpene synthase  genes. The dysfunction of the MYCs subsequently attenuates host defenses, increases the attraction of thrips, and improves thrips fitness. Moreover, MYC2 associated with NSs of Tomato zonate spot orthotospovirus, another Euro/Asian-type orthotospovirus, suggesting that MYC2 is an evolutionarily conserved target of  Orthotospovirus  species for suppression of terpene-based resistance to promote vector performance. These findings elucidate the molecular mechanism through which an orthotospovirus indirectly manipulates vector behaviors and therefore facilitates pathogen transmission. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which  Orthotospovirus  NSs counteracts plant immunity for pathogen transmission. Copyright: CC BY 4.0},

Of all chemical information gathered by animals, cues about predation risk are of special significance because predation risk usually has important and immediate consequences on fitness. In this paper we selectively review the role of chemical information in enemy avoidance by arthropods. Arthropods not only constitute important components of food webs, being the largest group in numbers and species diversity; they also make excellent models for ecological studies. We discuss the evidence, the key mechanisms, and the trade-offs involved in chemical detection of enemies by potential arthropod prey. Further, we address the variation in prey responses and the evidence for learning in avoiding enemies by arthropods. Finally, we identify and prioritize major questions to be tackled by future studies.},

Results showed that, when C. japonicus was at the young nymph stage in July, its attack was not able to induce persimmon trees to attract ladybeetles. In the contrast, persimmon trees after sprayed with MeJA displayed a significant attraction to the ladybeetles, which showed a fluctuation rhythm of increase-decrease-increase again. The peaks of attractive responses were 78.21 \% at 8 h (15: 00) and 73.42\% at 24 h (7: 00 next morning) after the MeJA treatment. A total of 17 chemical components were detected by GC/MS from the volatiles of MeJA-treated or control persimmon trees. Among those chemicals, 3 terpenoid components were higher in MeJA-treated trees than that in control trees, and 2[10]-pinene and D-limonene were detected only from the volatiles of MeJA-treated persimmon trees. These differences in the volatile compositions suggested the possible reason for the attraction of the treated persimmon trees to the ladybeetles, which was further confirmed by the ladybeetle attraction experiment with those chemicals. Both D-limonene and a-pinene displayed a significant attractiveness (78.95\% and 75.61\%, respectively) at concentration of 1 x 10-4 and 1 x 10-5 g [center dot] mL-1. Therefore, it is suggested that MGA as a signal transducer may be a potential agent in regulating volatile emissions of the host plant and improving biological control of scale insects. The fluctuation in amounts of terpenoid compounds was also found in the MeJA-treated trees. Up to 8 h after treatment, the relative content of 6 terpenoids all increased, but to the 12 h only 0.87\% a-pinene was detected.

	abstract = {Insect antennae have a primary function of detecting odors including sex pheromones and plant volatiles. The assumption that genes uniquely expressed in these antennae have an olfactory role has led to the identification of several genes that are integral components of odorant transduction, In the present study, differential display polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) was used to isolate 25 antennal-specific mRNAs from the male sphinx moth Manduca sexta, Northern blot analyses revealed that one clone, designated G7-9, was antennal-specific and was highly enriched in male antennae relative to female antennae. In situ hybridization indicated that G7-9 expression was restricted to a spatial domain of the olfactory epithelium occupied exclusively by sex-pheromone-sensitive olfactory sensilla, amino acid homology and phylogenetic analyses identified G7-9 as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST); we have named the full-length clone GST-msolf1, GSTs are known to function primarily in the detoxification of noxious compounds. Spectrophotometric and chromatographic analyses of total GST activity indicate that the endogenous GSTs of male and female antennae can modify trans-2-hexenal, a plant-derived green leaf aldehyde known to stimulate the olfactory system of M. sexta. The restricted localization of GST-msolf1 to sex-pheromone-sensitive sensilla, the fact that the sex pheromone of M. sexta consists of a complex mixture of aldehyde components, and the observation that antennal GSTs can modify an aldehyde odorant suggest that GST-msolf1 may have a role in signal termination. In the light of the more commonly observed role of GSTs in xenobiotic metabolism, we propose that GST-msolf1 may play a dual role of protecting the olfactory system from harmful xenobiotics and inactivating aldehyde odorants, especially components of the M. sexta sex pheromone.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary Some species of insect herbivores can feed on a wide variety of plant species. Over evolutionary time, insect herbivores can associate preferentially with different host-plant species, which frequently leads to genetic divergence between populations of an herbivore species. This phenomenon, referred to as host-associated differentiation (HAD), not only affects insect herbivores, but can also impact their associated natural enemies, particularly predatory or parasitic insects, which are responsible for biological control in agroecosystems. Although the mechanisms underlying HAD in populations of herbivores and associated natural enemies remain underexplored, we argue that the chemical communication between plants, herbivores, and natural enemies likely plays a major role. Chemical cues emitted by plants and insect herbivores influence natural enemy foraging behavior, and divergent chemical cues can lead to natural enemy HAD, ultimately shaping biological control. In this synthesis paper, we explore how the chemical ecology of HAD could influence classical, conservation, and augmentative biological control, and propose research agendas to further biological control efficacy through natural enemy selection. Host-associated differentiation (HAD) refers to cases in which genetically distinct populations of a species (e.g., herbivores or natural enemies) preferentially reproduce or feed on different host species. In agroecosystems, HAD often results in unique strains or biotypes of pest species, each attacking different species of crops. However, HAD is not restricted to pest populations, and may cascade to the third trophic level, affecting host selection by natural enemies, and ultimately leading to HAD within natural enemy species. Natural enemy HAD may affect the outcomes of biological control efforts, whether classical, conservation, or augmentative. Here, we explore the potential effects of pest and natural enemy HAD on biological control in agroecosystems, with emphases on current knowledge gaps and implications of HAD for selection of biological control agents. Additionally, given the importance of semiochemicals in mediating interactions between trophic levels, we emphasize the role of chemical ecology in interactions between pests and natural enemies, and suggest areas of consideration for biological control. Overall, we aim to jump-start a conversation concerning the relevance of HAD in biological control by reviewing currently available information on natural enemy HAD, identifying challenges to incorporating HAD considerations into biological control efforts, and proposing future research directions on natural enemy selection and HAD.},

We found no response to undamaged plants of either cucumber variety or plants that were actively being fed upon by A. vittatum females, whereas the response to volatiles associated with male A. vittatum was strong. Both male and female conspecifics and totals of up to sevenfold the number of males in the trap lures were caught overnight. Feeding males attracted more than double the number of conspecifics that responded to nonfeeding males. Active consumption of cucurbitacin in the plant on which the males were feeding, however, had no effect on attraction. A shift in sex ratio from a male to a female bias during field colonization season also supports the hypothesis that host finding is initiated by "pioneer" males. The importance of this aggregation pheromone in early-season host plant colonization and the evolutionary and adaptive significance of this pheromone are discussed.},

	abstract = {The food available to coccinellid larvae and their exposure to predation is influenced by where they are placed as eggs. This review examines adult distribution and female oviposition strategies which in turn determine the distribution of coccinellid larvae in habitats. Immigration into a habitat can be influenced by visual and olfactory cues related to habitat quality. Adults are retained in a habitat if sufficient food resources are present. The abundance and quality of food in a habitat affects the reproductive output of a female and survival of larvae. Consequently. there is higher retention and oviposition preference for sites with abundant essential prey. Coccinellids also increase reproduction in response to non-prey foods (i.e., pollen), but avoid ovipositing in areas with copious amounts of honeydew. In laboratory studies, many plant-derived chemicals have been demonstrated to be attractants and oviposition stimulants. The need to place eggs in proximity to food for offspring must be weighed against the risk of cannibalism and intraguild predation. Lady beetles avoid egg predation by reducing oviposition where other adults are present, ovipositing on plants associated with less exposure or incidence of intraguild predation, and avoiding areas with tracks and frass of con- and heterospecific larvae. Indeed, deterrent cues for avoiding predation seem stronger than the positive ones associated with food. An understanding of the resources needed for successful reproduction and larval development in a habitat and the sensory cues that signal these resources, and thus elicit oviposition, may enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms affecting coccinellid distribution in habitats.

In this study we used boll weevil as a model and mined its OBPs by RNA-Seq to study their simultaneous antennal expression by qPCR under controlled semiochemical stimuli with aggregation pheromone and plant volatiles. In the absence of a semiochemical stimulus, 23 of 24 OBPs were constitutively expressed in the antenna in both sexes. Semiochemicals changed systemically the expression of OBPs in both sexes. There were different patterns of up- and down-regulation in female antennae for each semiochemical stimulus, consistent with female chemical ecology. On the other hand, the only response in males was down-regulation of some OBPs. We suggest that these systemic changes in OBP expression might be related to enhancing detection of the semiochemical stimuli and/or priming the olfactory system to detect other environmental chemicals.},

	title = {Methanol {May} {Function} as a {Cross}-{Kingdom} {Signal}},
	abstract = {Recently, we demonstrated that leaf wounding results in the synthesis of pectin methylesterase (PME), which causes the plant to release methanol into the air. Methanol emitted by a wounded plant increases the accumulation of methanol-inducible gene mRNA and enhances antibacterial resistance as well as cell-to-cell communication, which facilitates virus spreading in neighboring plants. We concluded that methanol is a signaling molecule involved in within-plant and plant-to-plant communication. Methanol is considered to be a poison in humans because of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)-mediated conversion of methanol into toxic formaldehyde. However, recent data showed that methanol is a natural compound in normal, healthy humans. These data call into question whether human methanol is a metabolic waste product or whether methanol has specific function in humans. Here, to reveal human methanol-responsive genes (MRGs), we used suppression subtractive hybridization cDNA libraries of HeLa cells lacking ADH and exposed to methanol. This design allowed us to exclude genes involved in formaldehyde and formic acid detoxification from our analysis. We identified MRGs and revealed a correlation between increases in methanol content in the plasma and changes in human leukocyte MRG mRNA levels after fresh salad consumption by volunteers. Subsequently, we showed that the methanol generated by the pectin/PME complex in the gastrointestinal tract of mice induces the up- and downregulation of brain MRG mRNA. We used an adapted Y-maze to measure the locomotor behavior of the mice while breathing wounded plant vapors in two-choice assays. We showed that mice prefer the odor of methanol to other plant volatiles and that methanol changed MRG mRNA accumulation in the mouse brain. We hypothesize that the methanol emitted by wounded plants may have a role in plant-animal signaling. The known positive effect of plant food intake on human health suggests a role for physiological methanol in human gene regulation.},

These defend most species including the specialist leek moth, Acrolepiopsis assectella. We determined by measuring the increase in the sulfur precursor propyl-cysteine sulfoxide (PCSO) if production of this precursor is induced in response to moth attack and mechanical wounding. The concentration of PCSO was determined by HPLC in 2- or 6-mo-old leeks after attacks of various intensity either by the specialist leek moth or by a generalist moth, Agrotis ipsilon. Injury-induced release of sulfur volatiles was measured by GUMS after the attacks. Results showed an increase in the production of sulfur compounds in both the precursor and volatile form, occurring only in association with intensive attacks by leek moths. The increase in sulfur precursors also led to an increase in the release of sulfur volatiles.

In EAG tests there was no difference in response with respect to volatiles from damage at different levels on the plant. The possible ecological significance of these results are discussed in relation to predicted models of wound-induced defence and olfactory neurological coding.},

Beetles attracted to pine volatiles were significantly more desiccated, had air in their ventriculus, and were predominantly males. Beetles attracted to male pheromone in the presence of host volatiles were also significantly more desiccated and had air in their ventriculus, but differed in having visibly fewer fat bodies and being predominantly females. Factors not significantly related to host or pheromone response were beetle size, abundance of phoretic mites and parasitic nematodes, and ambient barometric pressure. This study indicates that certain physiological factors contribute to differences in response of individuals to host and male pheromone, theoretically enabling members of a population to exploit nearby as well as more distant susceptible hosts, which could enhance their immediate survival and, consequently, species diversity by outcrossing with other populations.},

Whereas there is evidence that some pathogens suppress these defences by interfering with signalling pathways involved in the defence, such evidence is scarce for herbivores. We found that the invasive spider mite Tetranychus evansi suppresses the induction of the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signalling routes involved in induced plant defences in tomato. This was reflected in the levels of inducible defence compounds, such as proteinase inhibitors, which in mite-infested plants were reduced to even lower levels than the constitutive levels in herbivore-free plants. Additionally, the spider mite suppressed the release of inducible volatiles, which are implicated in plant defence. Consequently, the mites performed much better on previously attacked plants than on non-attacked plants. These findings provide a new perspective on plant-herbivore interactions, plant protection and plant resistance to invasive species.},

Both traits attract carnivorous arthropods and function as indirect plant defences by increasing the predation pressure on attacking herbivores. We have conducted field experiments in Mexico and found that plants that had been exposed to VOCs thereafter responded to subsequent leaf damage with an increased EFN secretion. VOCs 'primed' the plants to respond more efficiently once they were attacked themselves. Such priming effects are well known for induced resistance to pathogens, yet this is the first description of VOCs priming EFN secretion, a taxonomically widespread anti-herbivore defence.

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that volatiles emitted by herbivore-damaged plants can cause responses in downwind undamaged neighboring plants, such as the attraction of carnivorous enemies of herbivores. One of the open questions is whether this involves an active (production of volatiles) or passive ( adsorption of volatiles) response of the uninfested downwind plant. This issue is addressed in the present study. Uninfested lima bean leaves that were exposed to volatiles from conspecific leaves infested with the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, emitted very similar blends of volatiles to those emitted from infested leaves themselves. Treating leaves with a protein-synthesis inhibitor prior to infesting them with spider mites completely suppressed the production of herbivore-induced volatiles in the infested leaves. Conversely, inhibitor treatment to uninfested leaves prior to exposure to volatiles from infested leaves did not affect the emission of volatiles from the exposed, uninfested leaves. This evidence supports the hypothesis that response of the exposed downwind plant is passive. T. urticae-infested leaves that had been previously exposed to volatiles from infested leaves emitted more herbivore-induced volatiles than T. urticae-infested leaves previously exposed to volatiles from uninfested leaves. The former leaves were also more attractive to the predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis, than the latter. This shows that previous exposure of plants to volatiles from herbivore-infested neighbors results in a stronger response of plants in terms of predator attraction when herbivores damage the plant. This supports the hypothesis that the downwind uninfested plant is actively involved. Both adsorption and production of volatiles can mediate the attraction of carnivorous mites to plants that have been exposed to volatiles from infested neighbors.},

We hypothesized that fragrance is emitted in patterns that correspond to pollinators, with high emissions during periods of pollinator activity and low emissions otherwise, especially during periods of peak floral herbivore activity. Using a combination of analytical chemistry and field observations, we examined both the diel and ontogenetic patterns of fragrance in two Cirsium species, in relation to visitation patterns of pollinators and florivores. Emission rates were highest at reproductive maturity, when insect visitation by both pollinators and florivores was also highest. In Cirsium arvense, the diel pattern of fragrance emission matched patterns of pollinator activity and was lowest when florivores were active. In contrast, scent in Cirsium repandum peaked at midday rather than with insect activity; neither species had a diel pattern that followed ambient temperature. Fragrance emission from C. repandum was 25 times lower than from staminate C. arvense and may not be essential for pollinator attraction, at least from a distance. The scent dynamics we observed in C. arvense are consistent with the hypothesis that fragrance emissions correspond with pollinator activity and are low when florivores are active.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary Ticks are responsible of transmitting serious disease agents of importance to human and veterinary health. Despite the importance of repellents, deterrents and acaricides in tick management, little is understood about the types of chemicals recognized and the mechanism behind chemoreception. Being almost totally blind, ticks rely on chemosensation to identify and locate hosts for a successful blood meal and to detect chemical signals in the environment. We explored the neurophysiology of tick chemosensory system in the context of behaviourally-relevant volatile stimuli, including essential oil components, to evaluate how the combination of attractants and plant volatile compounds is detected and processed. The observed inhibition (or deterrent effect) in tick electrophysiological response and behavioural activity, after the tick has been exposed to a binary mixture of attractant and volatile compound, represents an important advancement in understanding how tick olfaction works and what may be the mechanism behind detecting unpleasant odor stimuli and consequently been deterred. These information will provide more insights in developing new natural product-based deterrents for self-protection. Blacklegged ticks,Ixodes scapularis, represent a significant public health concern due to their vectoring of tick-borne disease. Despite their medical importance, there is still limited knowledge of the chemosensory system of this species, and thus a poor understanding of host-seeking behaviour and chemical ecology. We investigated the electrophysiological sensitivity of adult female blacklegged ticks to attractants and plant-derived compounds via an electrode inserted into the scutum. The response of female ticks to binary mixtures with a constant concentration of a selected attractant (butyric acid) and increasing concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (geraniol, phenethyl alcohol, beta-citronellol, and citral) was recorded. A strict relationship between increasing volatile concentration and a decreasing response was observed for each VOC. Y-tube bioassays confirmed that tick attraction towards butyric acid decreased with the presence of a VOC, which exerted a deterrent effect. To determine the specific role of sensory appendages involved in the detection of attractant chemical stimuli, we tested tick electrophysiological response after removing appendages that house chemosensory sensilla (foretarsi, pedipalps, or both). The chemosensory response was related to the molecular structure of attractant odorant, and the lack of pedipalps significantly reduced olfactory responses, suggesting they play an important role in detecting attractants. This study provides new insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying tick olfaction and the potential for interactions between attractant and deterrent chemical detection.},

This idea is based on the preference demonstrated by predatory mites such as Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot (Acari: Phytoseiidae) for volatiles produced by spider mite-infested plants in a closed environment (Y-tube wind tunnel). However, in natural open environments, kidney bean leaves heavily infested with Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) did not attract P. persimilis from the same distances as were used in the Y-tube tests. Therefore, the attraction of predatory mites for spider mite-infested plant volatiles in the Y-tube tests may reflect a preference in a closed environment and should be carefully interpreted as a basis for extrapolating predator-prey attraction mechanisms in the wild. On the other hand, we showed that adult female P. persimilis could follow trails laid down by adult female T. urticae in the laboratory and in natural open environments. Consequently, we propose that following spider mite trails represents another prey-searching cue for predatory mites.},

In this perspective, we discuss the potential for integrating the fields of plant-to-plant communication and microbial ecology to understand the chemical ecology of plant−microbiome interactions. As an introduction for microbial ecologists, we highlight mechanistic knowledge gaps in plant volatile organic compound (VOC) perception and provide recommendations for avoiding common experimental errors that have plagued the plant communication field. Lastly, we discuss potential implications of plant VOCs structuring rhizosphere microbiomes, particularly effects on plant community and evolutionary dynamics. As we continue to discover links between plant metabolism and their microbiomes—from molecular to community scales—we hope that this perspective will provide both motivation and words of caution for researchers working at the intersection of these two fields.},

Volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) emitted from floral tissues and green tissues of plants affect how plants interact with each other (informally termed ‘plant communication’), with mutualists such as pollinators and with enemies such as herbivores. In this chapter, we give an overview of VOC-based plant communication, in which plants that eavesdrop on VOC signals emitted from neighbouring herbivore-damaged plants increase their defence. While historically controversial, recent research has begun to establish the details of these interactions in various plant systems, including the identity of the VOC signal, the mechanism of VOC perception and the transduction pathways that link VOC perception to a defensive response. At the same time, ecological studies have begun to establish the evolutionary drivers of plant communication. Key insights from these studies are that these responses are kin-specific, memorable and mediated by known internal defence signals and epigenetic regulations in plant cells. Moving forward, studies that connect our increasing understanding of the mechanisms of plant–plant communication with their ecological consequences will help determine the importance of this type of defensive induction as well as the targets of selection within the plant–plant communication apparatus.},

However, a key aspect that has received less attention concerns the ecological specificity and context-dependency of this phenomenon. Knowledge on this is crucial for assessing the ecological mechanisms that govern plant communication, determining its biological significance under natural conditions, as well as designing effective strategies for its application (e.g. in crop protection). Here we synthesize important advances from incipient work on the ecological specificity of plant communication according to three main aspects: plant-based specificity, herbivore-based specificity, and the influence of the abiotic context.

These VOC emissions often show temporal dynamics which may influence the behavior of natural enemies using these volatiles as cues. This study analyzes on-line VOC emissions by roots of Brassica nigra plants under attack by cabbage root fly larvae, Delia radicum. Root emitted VOCs were detected using Proton-Transfer-Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) and Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS). These analyses showed that several sulfur containing compounds, such as methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) and glucosinolate breakdown products, such as thiocyanates (TC) and isothiocyanates (ITC), were emitted by the roots in response to infestation. The emissions were subdivided into early responses, emerging within 1–6h after infestation, and late responses, evolving only after 6–12h. The marker for rapid responses was detected at m/z 60. The ion detected at m/z 60 was identified as thiocyanic acid, which is also a prominent fragment in some TC or ITC spectra. The emission of m/z 60 stopped when the larvae had pupated, which makes it an excellent indicator for actively feeding larvae. Methanethiol, DMS and DMDS levels increased much later in infested roots, indicating that activation of enzymes or genes involved in the production of these compounds may be required. Earlier studies have shown that both early and late responses can play a role in tritrophic interactions associated with Brassica species. Moreover, the identification of these root induced responses will help to design non-invasive analytical procedures to assess root infestations.},

Aboveground herbivores are known to use changes in leaf volatile patterns to make foraging decisions, but it remains unclear whether belowground herbivores also use volatiles to select suitable host plants. We therefore investigated how above- and belowground infestation affects the performance of the root feeder Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, and whether the larvae of this specialized beetle are able to use volatile cues to assess from a distance whether a potential host plant is already under herbivore attack. Diabrotica virgifera larvae showed stronger growth on roots previously attacked by conspecific larvae, but performed more poorly on roots of plants whose leaves had been attacked by larvae of the moth Spodoptera littoralis. Fittingly, D. virgifera larvae were attracted to plants that were infested with conspecifics, whereas they avoided plants that were attacked by S. littoralis. We identified (E)-β-caryophyllene, which is induced by D. virgifera, and ethylene, which is suppressed by S. littoralis, as two signals used by D. virgifera larvae to locate plants that are most suitable for their development. Our study demonstrates that soil-dwelling insects can use herbivore-induced changes in root volatile emissions to identify suitable host plants.},

	abstract = {Figs and pollinating fig wasps are involved in highly specific mutualisms. Because associations between figs and their pollinating wasps are horizontally transmitted, partner encounter is a crucial step, and is mediated by the emission by receptive figs of the volatile compounds that are detected by the pollinator. However, pollinator attraction is probably not the only function of the volatile compounds produced by figs. Other likely functions include signalling to wasps that a fig has already been pollinated, and deterring or defending against visitors with negative effects on developing figs or the pollinators they contain. The functions of volatile compounds will also change over the course of fig development, and the composition of the odour bouquet is thus also likely to vary. However, this variation and its likely functional importance have rarely been studied. To address these questions, we investigated changes in the composition of the bouquet of volatile compounds, and in the rate of emission of odour components, before, during and after the phase of receptivity to pollinators in Ficus hispida, in Yunnan (China). This first study of the dynamics of variation in signal composition throughout the cycle of fig development, provides support for the hypothesis of chemical mimicry in dioecious figs.},

	abstract = {In terrestrial ecosystems, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are widely acknowledged as an important group of infochemicals. They play a major role in pollinator attraction by terrestrial plants and as insect pheromones. Furthermore, they are the mediating agent of so-called ‘tritrophic interactions’. When plants are attacked by herbivorous insects, volatile signal substances are emitted, which act as attractants for parasitoids that kill the herbivores, thereby protecting the plant from herbivory. Despite the generally acknowledged importance of VOCs in terrestrial chemical ecology, their functions in aquatic food webs are largely unknown. VOCs produced by algae and cyanobacteria are a major concern in water processing, since aquatic primary producers are the reason for regularly encountered taste and odour problems in drinking water. Only very recently, research in aquatic chemical ecology has started to investigate possible ecological functions for the production of VOCs by algae and cyanobacteria. Volatile aldehydes released by wounded cells of marine planktonic diatoms seem to act as defensive compounds against herbivorous copepods on the population level. Just recently, it was found that VOCs released from benthic algae and cyanobacteria can be utilised as food and/or habitat finding cues by aquatic invertebrates such as freshwater gastropods and nematodes. Here, I review concepts and recent experimental studies on the ecological functions of such VOCs in aquatic ecosystems. Understanding the factors that lead to the liberation of volatile compounds is an essential prerequisite to properly assessing their ecological functions. It appears that (similar to terrestrial plant–herbivore interactions) VOCs can also play a steering role for both attraction and defence in aquatic ecosystems.},

Almost three decades after it was first proposed that plants respond to VOCs from injured neighbors, this phenomenon is now well established and has been documented across multiple levels of biological organization (i.e., molecular, biochemical, and ecological). Recent studies have also shown that herbivore-induced VOCs can play a role in within-plant communication. In general, VOCs appear frequently to prime defenses in plants, enhancing plant responses to subsequent herbivore attack. The mechanisms underlying such effects remain largely unknown, though we have recently begun to learn more about the genes involved in plant–plant signaling. This chapter summarizes our current knowledge about the role of VOCs in plant-to-plant interactions. By synthesizing these findings, our chapter intends to point out gaps in existing research, in particular the need for further studies under natural conditions.},

Plants emit complex blends of chemicals that are involved in multitrophic interactions, coordination of systemic defence responses and pollination, whereas herbivorous insects release pheromones that play important roles in attracting mates, instigating defence responses and initiating aggregation. Interactions between plants and herbivores have been subject to a wealth of studies and knowledge on their biology, biochemistry, ecology and evolution is constantly expanding. In this chapter the idea of communication between plants and herbivores will be explored. Communication between organisms of consecutive trophic levels is somewhat controversial due to unidirectional reliance and competition precluding some of the requirements of a conventional communication process, but there are growing examples of where chemically mediated interactions between plants and herbivores can be viewed as eavesdropping by a signal recipient, or even as true communication where both chemical emitter and receiver gain a benefit from communication. Examples of herbivores responding to plant-emitted cues and plants responding to herbivore-emitted cues are both explored, and suggestions for future directions in this field are provided.},

Interestingly, insects perceive and process such complex environmental cues with their advanced olfactory system. During herbivory, plants also produce defensive volatiles recognized as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that often serve a dual purpose by attracting the natural enemies and giving an alarming signal to the plants nearby. Insects tend to avoid the host plants emitting such defensive volatiles and non-host plants, releasing non-host volatiles (NHVs). Understanding the dynamics of host selection through plant volatile recognition by pest insects is highly important to develop eco-friendly pest management practices employing strategies such as push-pull strategy. In the present chapter, we have reviewed different aspects of plant volatile production, insect olfactory system organization, the contribution of plant volatiles in host-seeking behavior of insects, and finally their potential use in formulating insect pest management strategies.},

Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are involved in plant communication with natural enemies of the insect herbivores, neighboring plants, and different parts of the damaged plant. Release of a wide variety of HIPVs in response to herbivore damage and their role in plant-plant, plant-carnivore and intraplant communications represents a new facet of the complex interactions among different trophic levels. HIPVs are released from leaves, flowers, and fruits into the atmosphere or into the soil from roots in response to herbivore attack. Moreover, HIPVs act as feeding and/or oviposition deterrents to insect pests. HIPVs also mediate the interactions between the plants and the microorganisms. This review presents an overview of HIPVs emitted by plants, their role in plant defense against herbivores and their implications for pest management.},

HIPVs play different ecological roles such as plant-plant interaction, plant-herbivore interaction, tritrophic interaction and other related interactions. Attractiveness of HIPVs to natural enemies in a tritrophic interaction varies depending on species diversity. Under natural and multiple cropping systems, tritrophic interaction is expected to be more complex than single tritrophic interaction with one species per trophic level. In complex tritrophic interaction, diversity of different trophic levels affects attractiveness of HIPVs to natural enemies. From plant diversity point of view, HIPVs mixture emanating from herbivore-damaged multiple plant species are reported to affect behavioral responses and foraging behavior of natural enemies under laboratory and ﬁeld conditions. Similarly, from herbivore diversity point of view, in nature, plants are commonly attacked by more than one herbivore species. Constituents of HIPVs vary between plants infested by multiple and single herbivore species and this affects the behavioral responses and foraging behavior of natural enemies. This paper reviews recent ﬁndings on the role of HIPVs as indirect plant defense in systems with simple tritrophic interaction, and in diverse plants species and diverse herbivore species.},

Experiments conducted outdoors suggest that communication occurs only within a limited distance from the damaged plants. Thus, the question remains as to whether VOCs work as a single component or a specific blend, and at which concentrations VOCs elicit insect and pathogen defenses in undamaged plants.

	abstract = {Plants emit volatile compounds that can act as a communication method to insects, neighboring plants and pathogens. Plants respond to leaf and root damage by herbivores and pathogens by emitting these compounds. The volatile compounds can deter the herbivores or pathogens directly or indirectly by attracting their natural enemies to kill them. The simultaneous damage of plants by herbivores and pathogens can influence plant defense. The induced plant volatiles can also make neighboring plants ready for defense or induce defense in parts distant from the damaged area of the same plant. Belowground root herbivory can alter the defense response to aboveground leaf herbivory. In addition, most plants normally emit volatile compounds from their flowers that directly attract foraging mutualistic insects for nectar, which in turn perform the very important function of pollination for subsequent reproduction. The volatile compounds emitted from the floral and vegetative parts of plants belong to three main classes of compounds: terpenoids, phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, and C6-aldehydes (green-leaf volatiles). The volatile phytohormones methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate serve as important signaling molecules for communication purposes, and interact with each other to optimize the plant defense response. Here we discuss and integrate the current knowledge on all types of communication between plants and insects, neighboring plants and pathogens that are mediated through plant volatiles.},

In this review, we focus on the multifunctional aspects of HIPVs, which vary qualitatively and quantitatively in emitting plant species and infesting herbivore species, in plant–carnivore interactions, plant–herbivore interactions, and plant–omnivore interactions. Additionally, we review the evidence of plant–plant communication and its effects on tritrophic interactions involving plants, herbivores, and carnivores.

For several of these cases, plants have been found to experience fitness benefits by responding to information (cues) released by experimentally damaged neighbors. However, it remains puzzling why plants might emit these cues following herbivore attack. One possibility is that release of cues is not adaptive for the emitter but rather cues leak out as a consequence of damage. Hypothetical benefits of emitting cues include: repelling herbivores; attracting predators of herbivores; suppressing germination of competitors; communicating with other branches of the same plant; and communicating with genetic relatives. Progress will be made in this field if we can find a system that is more tractable, allowing the nature of the cue to be identified and manipulated or allowing us to examine genetic constraints and influences on communication.},

It has been suggested that plant volatiles may have similar importance in mediating interactions among plant species, but there are few well-documented examples of plant-to-plant communication via volatiles, and the ecological significance of such interactions has been much debated. To date, nearly all studies of volatile-mediated interactions among plant species have focused on the reception of herbivore-induced volatiles by neighboring plants. We recently documented volatile effects in another system, demonstrating that the parasitic plant Cuscuta pentagona uses volatile cues to locate its hosts. This finding may broaden the discussion regarding plant-to-plant communication, and suggests that new classes of volatile-meditated interactions among plant species await discovery.},

Recent studies have revealed a novel mechanism of volatile-mediated plant–plant communication. Here, plants take up volatiles through the stomata and by adsorption on the leaf surface. The volatiles are then processed within leaf tissues. Reduction and esterification of compounds increase their volatility, and the converted volatiles are emitted again into the air. Volatiles taken up by a plant also undergo glycosylation and glutathionylation, resulting in their conversion to non-volatile compounds that have ecological functions. For example, one of the glycosylated compounds, (Z)-3-hexenyl vicianoside, functions in plant defences against insect herbivory. Conversion to non-volatile forms would enable uninjured plants to be more defended against herbivores moving from neighbouring herbivore-infested plants.

Species specific VOCs normally repel polyphagous herbivores and those specialised on other plant species, but may attract specialist herbivores and their natural enemies, which use VOCs as host location cues. Attraction of predators and parasitoids by VOCs is considered an evolved indirect defence, whereby plants are able to indirectly reduce biotic stress caused by damaging herbivores. In this chapter we review these interactions where VOCs are known to play a crucial role. We then discuss the importance of volatile communication in self and nonself detection. VOCs are suggested to appear in soil ecosystems where distinction of own roots from neighbours roots is essential to optimise root growth, but limited evidence of above-ground plant self-recognition is available. © 2012 Landes Bioscience and Springer Science+Business Media.},

In this review, we synthesise the recent progress made in understanding the role of plant volatiles as mediators of plant interactions at the individual and community levels, highlighting the complexity of the plant receiver response to diverse volatile cues and signals and addressing how specific responses shape plant growth and survival. Finally, we outline the knowledge gaps and provide directions for future research.

Individual VOCs can be directly toxic or deterrent, serve as signal molecules to attract natural enemies, and/or be perceived by distal plant tissues as a priming signal to prepare for expected herbivory. Environmental conditions, as well as the specific plant–insect interaction being investigated, strongly influence the observed functions of VOC blends. The complexity of plant–insect chemical communication via VOCs is further enriched by the sophisticated molecular perception mechanisms of insects, which can respond to one or more VOCs and thereby influence insect behavior in a manner that has yet to be fully elucidated. Despite numerous gaps in the current understanding of VOC-mediated plant–insect interactions, successful pest management strategies such as push–pull systems, synthetic odorant traps, and crop cultivars with modified VOC profiles have been developed to supplement chemical pesticide applications and enable more sustainable agricultural practices. Future studies in this field would benefit from examining the responses of both plants and insects in the same experiment to gain a more complete view of these interactive systems. Furthermore, a molecular evolutionary study of key genetic elements of the ecological interaction phenotypes could provide new insights into VOC-mediated plant communication with insect herbivores.},

	abstract = {Plants constitutively release volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but qualitatively and quantitatively alter their emission of VOCs in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. The blend of VOCs emitted reflects the physiological status of the plant. Plants may be exposed to the VOC blend emitted by their near neighbors and gain information that allows them to adjust their own defenses. These plant-plant interactions may potentially be exploited to protect crops from pests, but they can be disturbed by abiotic factors making the process sensitive to environmental perturbation. Despite numerous studies describing plant-plant interactions, relatively few have been conducted with agriculturally significant cultivated plant varieties under field conditions. Here we studied plant-plant interactions in a conspecific association of Brassica oleracea var. capitata (cabbage) and show that undamaged plants exposed to neighbors damaged by the herbivore Pieris brassicae are primed for stronger volatile emissions upon subsequent herbivore attack. We conducted a field study in an ozone free-air concentration enrichment (FACE) facility with ambient and elevated ozone levels and found that elevated tropospheric ozone significantly alters the priming of VOCs in receiver plants. We conclude that plant-plant interactions may prime defensive attributes of receiver plants under field conditions, but are impaired by ozone pollution. Therefore, when planning the manipulation of plant-plant interactions for agricultural purposes, the potential effects of atmospheric pollutants should be considered.},

	abstract = {A diverse, often species-specific, array of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are commonly emitted from plants after herbivore attack. Although research in the last 3 decades indicates a multi-functional role of these HIPVs, the evolutionary rationale underpinning HIPV emissions remains an open question. Many studies have documented that HIPVs can attract natural enemies, and some studies indicate that neighboring plants may eavesdrop their undamaged neighbors and induce or prime their own defenses prior to herbivore attack. Both of these ecological roles for HIPVs are risky strategies for the emitting plant. In a recent paper, we reported that most branches within a blueberry bush share limited vascular connectivity, which restricts the systemic movement of internal signals. Blueberry branches circumvent this limitation by responding to HIPVs emitted from neighboring branches of the same plant: exposure to HIPVs increases levels of defensive signaling hormones, changes their defensive status, and makes undamaged branches more resistant to herbivores. Similar findings have been reported recently for sagebrush, poplar, and lima beans, where intra-plant communication played a role in activating or priming defenses against herbivores. Thus, there is increasing evidence that intra-plant communication occurs in a wide range of taxonomically unrelated plant species. While the degree to which this phenomenon increases a plant’s fitness remains to be determined in most cases, we here argue that within-plant signaling provides more adaptive benefit for HIPV emissions than does between-plant signaling or attraction of predators. That is, the emission of HIPVs might have evolved primarily to protect undamaged parts of the plant against potential enemies, and neighboring plants and predators of herbivores later co-opted such HIPV signals for their own benefit.},

	abstract = {In the ecological context of insect-plant interactions, the interdependence of each other is important for their survival in complex ecosystem. Insect herbivores locate suitable host plants that can provide better resources for food and reproduction. In nocturnal herbivores, especially Lepidopterans, olfaction plays a major role during the selection of suitable host plants. Generally, Lepidopteran herbivores orient towards host plants using sensory cues such as volatile chemicals. Search for a host plant suitable for feeding, mating and oviposition is pertinent to the females while males are more conscious in mate and food findings. In addition, the chances of encountership between males and females increase in the presence of healthy host plants. Female moths prefer to lay eggs on healthy plants in order to provide better food resources for their offsprings. On the other hand, plants defend themselves from herbivore feeding by producing chemical volatiles as well as non-volatiles. The specific blend of volatile compounds in response to feeding damage by herbivores is commonly called as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). HIPVs are ecologically important because the plant species that release these compounds can improve their performance against attacking herbivores by several means e.g., by attracting the natural enemies of the herbivores or by repelling herbivores at a distance. 

Here, I review induced defenses in plants based on their classification along with perception and signaling in response to herbivory. In addition, the ecological significance of HIPVs at different levels will be described. Furthermore, I will highlight the ease of screening HIPVs on olfactory basis, by using different approaches within the laboratory, for their future implications in plant protection program.},

	abstract = {Tropospheric ozone (O3) is an important secondary air pollutant formed as a result of photochemical reactions between primary pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). O3 concentrations in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) are predicted to continue increasing as a result of anthropogenic activity, which will impact strongly on wild and cultivated plants. O3 affects photosynthesis and induces the development of visible foliar injuries, which are the result of genetically controlled programmed cell death. It also activates many plant defense responses, including the emission of phytogenic VOCs. Plant emitted VOCs play a role in many eco-physiological functions. Besides protecting the plant from abiotic stresses (high temperatures and oxidative stress) and biotic stressors (competing plants, micro- and macroorganisms), they drive multitrophic interactions between plants, herbivores and their natural enemies e.g., predators and parasitoids as well as interactions between plants (plant-to-plant communication). In addition, VOCs have an important role in atmospheric chemistry. They are O3 precursors, but at the same time are readily oxidized by O3, thus resulting in a series of new compounds that include secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). Here, we review the effects of O3 on plants and their VOC emissions. We also review the state of current knowledge on the effects of ozone on ecological interactions based on VOC signaling, and propose further research directions.},

	abstract = {Insect herbivores orient towards host plants using sensory cues and olfaction plays a major role, especially in nocturnal herbivores, during selection of host plants suitable for feeding, mating and oviposition. Plants defend themselves from herbivore feeding by producing volatiles as well as non-volatiles chemical compounds. Volatile compounds produced in response to feeding damage by herbivores are commonly referred to as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Emissions of HIPVs are ecologically important as they can increase plant resistance by repelling herbivores and by attracting the natural enemies of the herbivores. We observed a significant reduction in mating when male and female Spodoptera littoralis moths were allowed to mate in the presence of damaged cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) plants. Male activation and attraction towards female sex pheromone was reduced in the presence herbivore-damaged cotton plants. Similarly, females kept individually with damaged cotton plants spent less time in calling compared to females on undamaged plants. These results provide first evidence that herbivore-induced changes in host plants can affect calling and mating behaviours of an insect herbivore. 
In behavioural studies, in the laboratory as well as in the field, we showed that HIPV emissions from damaged cotton plant neighbours provide resistance to undamaged plants within both conspecific and heterospecific plant patches. Furthermore we found that associational resistance through HIPVs is unidirectional and is highly specific among the tested plant species. Undamaged cotton and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) plants in patches with damaged cotton plant neighbours received fewer eggs, whereas we found no associational resistance when damaged alfalfa and clover (Trifolium alexandrinum) neighbours were present. Electrophysiological (GC-EAD) studies showed that the antennae of the mated female S. littoralis moths detected 18 compounds among the headspace collections of HIPVs from damaged cotton plants. Behavioural studies showed that a blend of seven de novo synthesized volatile compounds among GC-EAD active compounds were sufficient to repel ovipositing S. littoralis. Our results suggest that de novo synthesized volatile compounds provide signalling cues to ovipositing female moths that the plants are under herbivore attack and can be used as reliable cues to avoid plants of low food quality and to reduce risk for competition and predation. Our studies show that HIPVs can have large effect on both male and female reproductive behaviours and that it can affect ecological interactions.},

Maize plants showed induction of a blend of volatiles including monoterpenes, sesequiterpenes, homoterpenes, green leaf volatiles, and indole, in response to the specialist herbivore Mythimna separata. Conspecific plants placed downwind of infested maize plants showed reduced larval development after exposure to HIPVs, compared to those exposed to volatiles from uninfested plants.

	abstract = {Herbivorous and carnivorous arthropods use plant volatiles when foraging for food. In response to herbivory, plants emit a blend that may be quantitatively and qualitatively different from the blend emitted when intact. This induced volatile blend alters the interactions of the plant with its environment. We review recent developments regarding the induction mechanism as well as the ecological consequences in a multitrophic and evolutionary context. It has been well established that carnivores (predators and parasitoids) are attracted by the volatiles induced by their herbivorous victims. This concerns an active plant response. In the case of attraction of predators, this is likely to result in a fitness benefit to the plant, because through consumption a predator removes the herbivores from the plant. However, the benefit to the plant is less clear when parasitoids are attracted, because parasitisation does usually not result in an instantaneous or in a complete termination of consumption by the herbivore. Recently, empirical evidence has been obtained that shows that the plant's response can increase plant fitness, in terms of seed production, due to a reduced consumption rate of parasitized herbivores. However, apart from a benefit from attracting carnivores, the induced volatiles can have a serious cost because there is an increasing number of studies that show that herbivores can be attracted. However, this does not necessarily result in settlement of the herbivores on the emitting plant. The presence of cues from herbivores and/or carnivores that indicate that the plant is a competitor- and/or enemy-dense space, may lead to an avoidance response. Thus, the benefit of emission of induced volatiles is likely to depend on the prevailing faunal composition. Whether plants can adjust their response and influence the emission of the induced volatiles, taking the prevalent environmental conditions into account, is an interesting question that needs to be addressed. The induced volatiles may also affect interactions of the emitting plant with its neighbours, e.g., through altered competitive ability or by the neighbour exploiting the emitted information. Major questions to be addressed in this research field comprise mechanistic aspects, such as the identification of the minimally effective blend of volatiles that explains the attraction of carnivores to herbivore-infested plants, and evolutionary aspects such as the fitness consequences of induced volatiles. The elucidation of mechanistic aspects is important for addressing ecological and evolutionary questions. For instance, an important tool to address ecological and evolutionary aspects would be to have plant pairs that differ in only a single trait. Such plants are likely to become available in the near future as a result of mechanistic studies on signal-transduction pathways and an increased interest in molecular genetics.},

	abstract = {One of the most important challenges for individual plants is coexistence with their neighbors. To compensate for their sessile lifestyle, plants developed complex and sophisticated chemical systems of communication among each other. Site-specific biotic and abiotic factors constantly alter the physiological activity of plants, which causes them to release various secondary metabolites in their environments. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the most common cues that reflect a plant’s current physiological status. In this sense, the identity of its immediate neighbors may have the greatest impact for a plant, as they share the same available resources. Plants constantly monitor and respond to these cues with great sensitivity and discrimination, resulting in specific changes in their growth pattern and adjusting their physiology, morphology, and phenotype accordingly. Those typical competition responses in receivers may increase their fitness as they can be elicited even before the competition takes place. Plant–plant interactions are dynamic and complex as they can include many different and important surrounding cues. A major challenge for all individual plants is detecting and actively responding only to “true” cues that point to real upcoming threat. Such selective responses to highly specific cues embedded in volatile bouquets are of great ecological importance in understanding plant–plant interactions. We have reviewed recent research on the role of VOCs in complex plant–plant interactions in plant-cross kingdom and highlighted their influence on organisms at higher trophic levels.},

	abstract = {Studies show that plant defenses influence the host-use of herbivores and tend to be evolutionarily more labile than herbivore traits (e.g. feeding preferences). However, all previous studies have focused exclusively on non-volatile plant defenses thereby overlooking the roles of plant volatiles. We hypothesized that volatiles are equally important determinants of herbivore host-use and are evolutionarily more labile than herbivore traits. To test these hypotheses, the following experiments were conducted. We identified the volatiles and non-volatiles of 17 Asteraceae species and measured their relative contents. We also used a highly resolved bipartite trophic network of the 17 host species and 20 herbivorous (pre-dispersal seed predator) tephritid fly species to determine the evolutionary interactions between plants and herbivores. The chemical data showed that interspecific similarity in volatiles—but not non-volatiles and phylogenetic distance—significantly accounted for the herbivore community across the plant species; this implies that plant volatiles—but not non-volatile compounds and species identity—dictate plant-tephritid fly interactions. Moreover, we observed phylogenetic signal for non-volatiles but not for volatiles; therefore closely related herbivores do not necessarily use closely related host species with similar non-volatiles, but do tend to attack plants producing similar volatiles. Thus, plant volatiles are evolutionarily more labile than non-volatiles and herbivore traits associate with host use. These results show that the interactions between plants and herbivores are evolutionary asymmetric, shed light on the role of plant volatiles in plant–herbivore interactions, and highlight the need to include data for both volatiles and non-volatiles when investigating plant–animal interactions.},

Several individual volatile priming cues have been identified, but whether plants are able to integrate multiple cues from stress-related volatile blends remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how maize plants respond to two herbivore-induced volatile priming cues with complementary information content, the green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate (HAC) and the aromatic volatile indole. In the absence of herbivory, HAC directly induced defence gene expression, whereas indole had no effect. Upon induction by simulated herbivory, both volatiles increased jasmonate signalling, defence gene expression, and defensive secondary metabolite production and increased plant resistance. Plant resistance to caterpillars was more strongly induced in dual volatile-exposed plants than plants exposed to single volatiles.. Induced defence levels in dual volatile-exposed plants were significantly higher than predicted from the added effects of the individual volatiles, with the exception of induced plant volatile production, which showed no increase upon dual-exposure relative to single exposure. Thus, plants can integrate different volatile cues into strong and specific responses that promote herbivore defence induction and resistance. Integrating multiple volatiles may be beneficial, as volatile blends are more reliable indicators of future stress than single cues.},

	abstract = {Plants may defend themselves by promoting the effectiveness of enemies of herbivores, which is termed {\textless}indirect defense{\textgreater}. In the past 10 years it has become known that plants may respond to being damaged by herbivorous arthropods by producing volatiles that attract carnivorous arthropods. These volatiles are different from those emitted in response to mechanical damage and terpenoids are a major class among the herbivore-induced carnivore attractants. Herbivore secretions such as caterpillar regurgitate elicit the plant response. The carnivore-attractants are produced at the site of herbivore damage as well as systemically throughout the plant. An elicitor that is exported from herbivore-infested leaves and induced carnivore-attractant production in uninfested leaves has recently been extracted. Herbivore cues are not very detectable to carnivores at a distance, herbivore-induced plant volatiles increase herbivore detectability enormously. Moreover, herbivore-induced plant volatiles may also provide carnivores with information about the plant species, the plant cultivar and the herbivore species that infests the plant and thus are more reliable to carnivores than general damage-related plant volatiles. Therefore, herbivore-induced volatiles are an essential information source for carnivores that search for herbivores. Among the terpenoids the two homoterpenes 4,8-dimethyl-1,3(E),7-nonatriene and 4,8,12-trimethyl- 1,3(E),7(E),11-tridecatetraene are the most often reported herbivore-induced plant volatiles. They can be synthesized by plants of many species from the terpene alcohols nerolidol and geranyllinalool without any mediation of herbivory. Whether the production of nerolidol and geranyllinalool is effectuated by herbivore enzymes or by herbivore-induced plant enzymes remains to be elucidated. That plants repond to herbivory by producing terpenoid carnivore attractans should challenge phytochemists, plant biochemists and plant molecular biologists to investigate the signal-transduction pathway and the regulation mechanisms of this intriguing defense of plants.},

	abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is naturally synthesized in the human body and presents many beneficial biological effects; in particular on the cardiovascular system. Recently; many researchers tried to develop external sources to increase the NO level in the body; for example by using amidoximes and oximes which can be oxidized in vivo and release NO. In this review; the classical methods and most recent advances for the synthesis of both amidoximes and oximes are presented first. The isomers of amidoximes and oximes and their stabilities will also be described; (Z)-amidoximes and (Z)-oximes being usually the most energetically favorable isomers. This manuscript details also the biomimetic and biological pathways involved in the oxidation of amidoximes and oximes. The key role played by cytochrome P450 or other dihydronicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent reductase pathways is demonstrated. Finally, amidoximes and oximes exhibit important effects on the relaxation of both aortic and tracheal rings alongside with other effects as the decrease of the arterial pressure and of the thrombi formation},

	abstract = {Plants can respond actively to damage by herbivores. In addition to a mode of defence that is directly aimed at the herbivore itself, plants can emit volatiles that attract carnivores, i.e. the enemies of their enemies. Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the induction of these herbivore-induced plant volatiles and of the responses of the carnivores is progressing rapidly. Inferences on the initial causes of evolution of herbivore-induced plant volatiles remain conjectural. However, once plant–carnivore interactions have evolved to the net benefit of both participants this mutualism is expected to have evolutionary and ecological consequences for the three trophic levels involved. When plant selection and foraging behaviour of natural enemies is linked to plant fitness this can influence different aspects of the plant defence strategy. The way carnivores perceive and process plant information may influence the evolution of the plant signal (i.e. quantitative and qualitative composition of the odour blend in response to herbivore damage). Vice versa, the signal-to-noise ratio of the information may influence the way carnivores respond to plant cues (innately or through learning). Selection will act on herbivores to disconnect the plant-carnivore link, for example by boycotting the informational value of herbivore-induced synomones. Through plant selection and feeding behaviour herbivores can influence their chance of being found by carnivores. Hence, responses of carnivores to plant cues can influence the evolution of food-plant use by herbivores. The conspiracy between plants and carnivores is at the heart of evolutionary ecology, and wide open for experimental and theoretical investigations.},

Plethora of investigations has explored the attractiveness of HIPVs to arthropod natural enemies. Natural enemies such as arthropod parasitoids and predators utilize HIPVs to locate and feed or parasitize their prey or host and by recruiting these mutualistic, the plant gets protection against antagonist herbivores.

Volatiles have also been demonstrated to protect plants by attracting herbivore enemies, such as parasitic wasps, predatory arthropods and possibly even insectivorous birds. Even below ground herbivory results in the release of volatiles that attract herbivore enemies. However, plant volatiles are also known to attract enemies of plants. Hence, to determine the true value of these substances in defense, more research is needed especially in natural communities with non-agricultural species.},

	abstract = {Plants that are damaged by herbivorous arthropods provide carnivorous enemies of the herbivores with important information. They emit an induced volatile blend that is highly detectable to the carnivores from a distance. Such detectable signals that indicate herbivore presence are important for the carnivores because herbivores themselves are under strong selection not to expose themselves. In addition, carnivores would benefit from a specificity of the induced plant volatiles. Whether herbivore-induced plant volatiles are reliable indicators of herbivore identity, however, has not been resolved unambiguously. Some studies support the reliability of herbivore-induced plant volatiles, while others do not. Different approaches have been used such as chemical analysis, behavioural analysis or a combination of the two. Based on the total of chemical studies one might conclude that in most cases herbivore-induced plant volatiles are not very specific for the herbivore that damages the plant. However, arthropod chemosensors are much more sensitive than the detectors of analytical instruments. Therefore, chemical analyses are not suitable to demonstrate whether or not herbivore-induced plant volatiles are reliable indicators of herbivore identity to carnivores. Behavioural studies should provide this information. In analysing carnivore behaviour it should be realised, however, that arthropod behaviour can be highly variable. Arthropod foraging decisions are affected by external and internal factors such as (a) abiotic environmental factors, (b) presence of competitors or enemies, (c) deprivation of food or oviposition sites, (d) specific deprivation of certain nutrients or (e) learning. In this paper their effect on discrimination of carnivores between volatile blends emitted by plants infested by different herbivores is reviewed. This provides testable hypotheses of why discrimination was not found in some studies. The ability of carnivores to discriminate is likely to be more common than is clear to date, which should invoke functional studies of the conditions that influence the occurrence of this discrimination.},

	abstract = {Above-ground plant tissues produce characteristic blends of volatile compounds in response to insect herbivory. These herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) function in plant defence and mediate foraging decisions by herbivores and their natural enemies. The ecological roles of HIPVs as foraging cues for different trophic levels highlight an important conflict for herbivores that need to locate suitable host plants while avoiding competition and predation. Plant roots also emit HIPVs following herbivory, but our understanding of root-produced volatiles and their ecological functions in soil environments remains limited. Moreover, recent studies have documented the effects of temporal dynamics of plant volatile production on ecological interactions, but little is known about how root HIPVs change throughout herbivory or the resulting ecological implications from such changes. In this study, we examined the roles of HIPVs from roots of cucumber plants Cucumis sativus as foraging cues for a specialist herbivore, striped cucumber beetle Acalymma vittatum and its natural enemies, entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs). We predicted HIPVs from A. vittatum-damaged roots would attract EPNs, while repelling conspecific larvae that avoid competition, induced plant defences and increased risk of predation by EPNs. To capture the temporal dynamics of root HIPVs, we determined how HIPV-mediated interactions change over time with sustained herbivory. Initially (after 24 hr), A. vittatum herbivory on C. sativus, or mechanical wounding, induced greater production of root volatiles. These root HIPVs recruited EPNs and repelled foraging A. vittatum larvae, although larval performance was not affected by prior damage. Sustained (7 days) herbivory by larvae reduced HIPVs to levels indistinguishable from undamaged control roots while mechanically damaged roots continued to produce higher levels of volatiles. Attenuation of HIPVs impaired indirect defence responses of C. sativus by reducing recruitment of EPNs and deterrence of A. vittatum larvae. These results suggest that root HIPVs function as honest signals that indicate the presence of herbivores, induction of indirect plant defences and increased risk of predation by natural enemies. However, some herbivores may overcome this line of plant defence by attenuating production of HIPVs and thus altering the outcomes of subsequent interactions among plants, herbivores and natural enemies.

	abstract = {Herbivore induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are specific volatile organic compounds (VOC) that a plant produces in response to herbivory. Some HIPVs are only produced after damage, while others are also produced by intact plants, but in lower quantities. Among the known functions of HIPVs are within plant volatile signaling to activate systemic plant defenses, the priming and activation of defenses in neighboring plants and the attraction of natural enemies of herbivores. When released into the atmosphere a plant's control over the produced compounds ends. However, many of the HIPVs are highly reactive with atmospheric oxidants and their atmospheric life times could be relatively short, often only a few minutes. We summarise the potential ecological and atmospheric processes that involve the reaction products of HIPVs in their gaseous, liquid and solid secondary organic aerosol (SOA) forms, both in the atmosphere and after deposition on plant surfaces. A potential negative feedback loop, based on the reactions forming SOA from HIPVs and the associated stimulation of sun screening cloud formation is presented. This hypothesis is based on recent field surveys in the geographical areas facing the greatest degree of global warming and insect outbreaks. Furthermore, we discuss how these processes could benefit the individual plant or conspecifics that originally released the HIPVs into the atmosphere. Further ecological studies should aim to elucidate the possible reasons for biosynthesis of short-lived volatile compounds to have evolved as a response to external biotic damage to plants.},

Because many moths—whose larvae are some of the most important insect herbivores—are nocturnal, herbivore-induced plant volatiles have not hitherto been considered to be temporally available as host-location cues for ovipositing females. Here we present chemical and behavioural assays showing that tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum) release herbivore-induced volatiles during both night and day. Moreover, several volatile compounds are released exclusively at night and are highly repellent to female moths (Heliothis virescens). The demonstration that tobacco plants release temporally different volatile blends and that lepidopteran herbivores use induced plant signals released during the dark phase to choose sites for oviposition adds a new dimension to our understanding of the role of chemical cues in mediating tritrophic interactions.},

	abstract = {Animals depend on reliable sensory information for accurate behavioural decisions. For herbivorous insects it is crucial to find host plants for feeding and reproduction, and these insects must be able to differentiate suitable from unsuitable plants. Volatiles are important cues for insect herbivores to assess host plant quality. It has previously been shown that female moths of the Egyptian cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), avoid oviposition on damaged cotton Gossypium hirsutum, which may mediated by herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Among the HIPVs, some volatiles are released following any type of damage while others are synthesized de novo and released by the plants only in response to herbivore damage. In behavioural experiments we here show that oviposition by S. littoralis on undamaged cotton plants was reduced by adding volatiles collected from plants with ongoing herbivory. Gas chromatography–electroantennographic detection (GC–EAD) recordings revealed that antennae of mated S. littoralis females responded to 18 compounds from a collection of headspace volatiles of damaged cotton plants. Among these compounds, a blend of the seven de novo synthesized volatile compounds was found to reduce oviposition in S. littoralis on undamaged plants under both laboratory and ambient (field) conditions in Egypt. Volatile compounds that are not produced de novo by the plants did not affect oviposition. Our results show that ovipositing females respond specifically to the de novo synthesized volatiles released from plants under herbivore attack. We suggest that these volatiles provide reliable cues for ovipositing females to detect plants that could provide reduced quality food for their offspring and an increased risk of competition and predation.},

	abstract = {Changes in plant volatile emission can be induced by exposure to volatiles from neighbouring insect-attacked plants. However, plants are also exposed to volatiles from unattacked neighbours, and the consequences of this have not been explored. We investigated whether volatile exchange between undamaged plants affects volatile emission and plant-insect interaction. Consistently greater quantities of two terpenoids were found in the headspace of potato previously exposed to volatiles from undamaged onion plants identified by mass spectrometry. Using live plants and synthetic blends mimicking exposed and unexposed potato, we tested the olfactory response of winged aphids, Myzus persicae. The altered potato volatile profile deterred aphids in laboratory experiments. Further, we show that growing potato together with onion in the field reduces the abundance of winged, host-seeking aphids. Our study broadens the ecological significance of the phenomenon; volatiles carry not only information on whether or not neighbouring plants are under attack, but also information on the emitter plants themselves. In this way responding plants could obtain information on whether the neighbouring plant is a competitive threat and can accordingly adjust their growth towards it. We interpret this as a response in the process of adaptation towards neighbouring plants. Furthermore, these physiological changes in the responding plants have significant ecological impact, as behaviour of aphids was affected. Since herbivore host plants are potentially under constant exposure to these volatiles, our study has major implications for the understanding of how mechanisms within plant communities affect insects. This knowledge could be used to improve plant protection and increase scientific understanding of communication between plants and its impact on other organisms.},

The release of volatile signals by plants occurs not only in response to tissue damage but is also specifically initiated by exposure to herbivore salivary secretions. Although some volatile compounds are stored in plant tissues and immediately released when damage occurs, others are induced by herbivore feeding and released not only from damaged tissue but also from undamaged leaves. Thus, damage localized to only a few leaves results in a systemic response and the release of volatiles from the entire plant. New evidence suggests that, in addition to being highly detectable and reliable indicators of herbivore presence, herbivore-induced plant volatiles may convey herbivore-specific information that allows parasitoids to discriminate even closely-related herbivore species at long range. Here we give an overview of the recent developments in the investigation of plant-parasitoid interactions.},

Herbivore attack can dramatically increase plant volatile emissions in many species. However, plants do not only react to herbivore-inflicted damage, but also already start adjusting their metabolism upon egg deposition by insects. Several studies have found evidence that egg deposition itself can induce the release of volatiles, but little is known about the effects of oviposition on the volatiles released in response to subsequent herbivory. To study this we measured the effect of oviposition by Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) moths on constitutive and herbivore-induced volatiles in maize (Zea mays L.). Results demonstrate that egg deposition reduces the constitutive emission of volatiles and suppresses the typical burst of inducible volatiles following mechanical damage and application of caterpillar regurgitant, a treatment that mimics herbivory. We discuss the possible mechanisms responsible for reducing the plant’s signaling capacity triggered by S. frugiperda oviposition and how suppression of volatile organic compounds can influence the interaction between the plant, the herbivore, and other organisms in its environment. Future studies should consider oviposition as a potential modulator of plant responses to insect herbivores.},

	abstract = {One of the responses of plants to insect attack is the production of volatile organic compounds that mediate indirect defence of plants by attracting natural enemies of the attacking herbivores. Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) include terpenoids that play key roles in the attraction of natural enemies. Crosstalk between phytohormonal signalling pathways is well known to affect the regulation of plant defences, including the emission of HIPVs. Thus, simultaneous feeding on the same plant by caterpillars and aphids, can affect the attraction of parasitoids by the plant compared to single insect attack. The role of aphid density in the regulation of HIPV emission by plants under dual attack has not been studied previously. Here, we investigated the attraction of Diadegma semiclausum, a parasitoid of the Diamondback moth Plutella xylostella, to volatiles emitted by Arabidopsis thaliana plants, simultaneously attacked by host caterpillars, and by the non-host aphid Brevicoryne brassicae. Our study shows that the effect of aphid infestation on parasitoid attraction is influenced by the density of the aphids. Biosynthesis and emission of (E,E)-α-farnesene could be linked to the observed preference of D. semiclausum parasitoids for the HIPV blend emitted by plants dually infested by caterpillars and aphids at a high density compared to dually infested plants with a low aphid density. Parasitoids such as D. semiclausum are important enemies of herbivorous insects and a better understanding of how plants express indirect defence mechanisms in response to multiple insect attack will provide important knowledge on plant–herbivore–parasitoid interactions under multiple stress conditions.},

	abstract = {"Sem resumo feito pelo autor";- Ecological relationships of plants and animals are universal, of fundamental importance, and paradoxical. Plants use solar energy to fix carbon, and all animal life ultimately depends on use of energy stored by plants. How can an Earth teeming with herbivores, ranging in size from aphids to elephants, be so green? Animals do not eat all plants. Somehow most plants, most of the time, manage to avoid being eaten. 
Charles Darwin (1859) provided the key to questions borne of this paradox in the "On the Origin of Species" (Darwin, 1987). He proposed the theory of evolutionary adaptation by natural selection. Darwin argued that plants and animals best fitted to their environments leave more offspring than other members of their species and, consequently, pass their inherited advantages on to future generations. Darwin even provided insight into the nature of plant defences and animal ability to cope with those defences. He noted that sheep of different breeds have different susceptibilities to plant poisons. The fittest herbivores have an inherited ability to cope with those plant defences, and therefore to prosper on plants that their competitors cannot eat. Plants have evolved an enormous array of mechanical and chemical defences against herbivores. Herbivores, on the other hand, evolved an array of adaptations to overcome the plant defences. As pointed out by Ehrlich and Raven (1964), "the plant-herbivore interface may be the major zone of interactions responsible for generating terrestrial organic diversity". 
The phytophagous insects make up a more than a quarter of all macroscopic organisms, and the plants upon which they feed make up another quarter (Bernays and Chapman, 1994). Every green plant has a set of insect herbivores feeding on its roots, steams, buds, leaves, flowers and fruits. Although there is a continuous spectrum of phytophagous insects species, from those feeding on one plant species to those feeding on a wide range of plants of different families, it is common to classify them as follows: 1) monophagous include species that feed on plants within a single genus; 2) oligophagous includes species that feed on various plants in different genera within one plant family; and 3) polvphagous refers to insects feeding on a relatively large number of plant species of different families (Bernays and Chapman, 1994). Most insects have relatively narrow range of host plant species. Out of approximately 310,000 known phytophagous insect species, about 75\% are monophagous or oligophagous (Bernays and Chapman, 1994) and these will be faced with the necessity of selecting the appropriate host plant at some stage of their life 
cycle. The study of the behavioural mechanisms underlying the selection of a suitable host plant 
by phytophagous insects is a challenging endeavour, and is central to understand how the present 
insect-plant associations have evolved, and to know what are the proximate causes of the narrow 
host ranges of most phytophagous insect species. 
The evolutionary questions have provided motivation for the study of insect-plant 
interactions. At the ultimate level, insect-plant associations can be explained in terms of relative 
fitness of insects on their host plants and, presumably, natural selection reinforces behavioural 
preference for suitable plants and avoidance of unsuitable ones (Feeny, 1992). Phytophagous 
insects may have had a role to play in the evolution of plants, by selecting for diverse chemical 
and physical defences. Many ecologists believe that the current diversity of both plants and 
insects is, in part, a result of their co-evolution (refs. in Jermy, 1993). Through an evolutionary 
"arras rate" between plants and insects, the plants have evolved defences to reduce herbivore 
pressure whilst the insects evolved ways for overcoming some of the defences. This again had 
consequences in a multitude of animals at higher trophic levels. Others believe that the 
adaptation and diversity of the insects has tended to follow that of the plants, in this case being 
less important the influence of insects on the evolution of plants. In other words, it is proposed 
that the evolution of insect-plant associations results primarily from autonomous evolutionary 
events, i.e. heritable functional changes within the insects' behavioural and sensorial mechanisms 
would mediate changes in insect-plant associations, and the ecological factors would play a 
secondary role by either supporting or preventing the establishment of the new genotype with the 
novel plant preferences (Jermy, 1993). The study of phytophagous insect behaviour tenda to have 
been neglected, yet the scientific knowledge of the proximate causes of behaviour and their 
variation is important to answer the evolutionary questions. The behavioural changes are 
important adaptations to be selected when an insect shifts or widens its host range. Any 
morphological or physiological changes, potentially adaptive to exploit a new host plant, are 
inconsequent if they do not occur together with behavioural changes. Thus, knowledge, about 
behaviour and its variation is essential to the major evolutionary questions of insect-plant 
relationships. 
Another important motivation for studying insect-plant interactions is that specialists as 
well as generalist phytophagous insect species have become economically important as pests on 
agricultural crops. Increased concern for the environment, the continued need to minimise 
possible hazards from crop protection agents, and the rapid development of pesticide resistance 
have placed tremendous demands on, research to provide new methods of pest control. These can 
only be successfully implemented on the basis of a detailed knowledge about the behavioural mechanisms by which phytophagous insects select host plants. 
The host plant selection process consists of a sequence of behavioural responses to an array of stimuli associated with host and non-host plants (Visser, 1986). Plant secondary metabolites are important stimuli in this process. These include a wide variety of organic compounds not directly involved in the primary metabolism of plants (photosynthesis, respiration, biosynthesis of proteins), and some of them have been implicated in regulating chemical mediated interactions with other organisms acting as serniochernicals1. Several plant secondary compounds contribute to defense against various organisms, including fungal pathogens, other plants, and herbivorous animals ranging from insects to man, acting as general toxicants or biocides, or may have a specific toxic action directed at a particular target. They may also act as chemical messengers or signals with purely behavioural effect, and in many cases plant chemical defenses have become signals to herbivores for selection of suitable host plants. In phytophagous insects, volatile secondary compounds have been implicated in the process of host plant selection. These are detected at some distance from the plant, affecting insects' orientation during host-finding behaviour. They act as chemical signals that attract the insect to suitable host plants or induce avoidance reactions to unsuitable plants for feeding and/or oviposition. 
A largo part of insects' olfactory system is thought to be specifically involved in conveying and processing information about plant volatile compounds (Mustaparta, 1992). However, it is scarce the knowledge concerning which volatile compounds or blends of compounds affect the behaviour of phytophagous insects. There is a need to focus research on what are the plant odours (host and non-host) important in host selection of different insect species with different ranges of host plants. Attraction and avoidance are important characteristics of olfaction, and it is therefore important that chernical, signals from both host and non-host plants are identified and studied, as regard their behavioural effect on insects and how such chemo-sensorial input is detected and processed. 
Semiochemicals that regulate insect-plant interactions have long been seen to have potential for developing new methods of pest management, e.g. through the exploitation of plant 
secondary metabolism for modification of insect behaviour, or to develop resistant crop cultivars (Pickett et al., 1991; Hallahan et al., 1992). The resistance of some agricultural crops varieties results in many cases from plant chemical features that have an effect on the insect behaviour, however the resistant plants have often been developed without knowledge about what modifies the behaviour. With a greater knowledge about the mechanisms by which the insects select host plants, many more resistant varieties can be developed. 
The eucalyptus woodborer, Phoracantha semipunctata Fabricius, is a cerambycid of Australian origin that has a range of host plants restricted to species mainly of Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae). It has been introduced to several regions of the world following the introduction of Eucalyptus for ornamental purposes or economic exploitation of its wood and essential oils. Whereas this insect species is of no economic importance in Australia, it has become a severe pest of eucalyptus plantations in, the introduced regions, including Portugal and several other Mediterranean countries (e.g. Spain, Italy, Marrocco and Tunísia). In Portugal, P. semipunctata was detected for the first time in the península of Setúbal in 1980 (Figo, 1981). Since then, the populations have increased dramatically and have spread throughout nearly all eucalyptus plantations of the country, causing significant economic losses for the growers and the pule paper industry, mainly in the central and southern regions of Portugal. 
P. semipunctata males and females fly at dusk and during the night in search for mates and oviposition sites. The females oviposit in bark cracks or under loose bark, preferentially on recently felled or weakened trees. Tree damage is caused by the larvae feeding on the bark. Heavy infestations result in the destruction of cambium and phloem tissues along the trunk leading to the death of the tree (Chararas, 1969; Drinkwater, 1975; Scriven et aL, 1986). Current methods of P. semipunctata control exploit the extraordinary ability of females to colonise recently felled trees. Log traps for the eggs have been used by Eucalyptus growers in order to 
.V gr 
reduce the beetles' population size of the next generation (e.g. Egea, 1982; Tirado, 1984, 1990). Some authors have suggested a role for the odour of Eucalyptus in host plant selection by P. semipunctata (Powell, 1978; Hanks et al., 1993); however this has never been thoroughly investigated.},

	abstract = {1 Many plant species respond to herbivory with increased emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs): these attract carnivorous arthropods and thereby function as an indirect defence mechanism. Whether neighbouring plants can ‘eavesdrop’ on such airborne cues and tailor their defences accordingly, remains controversial. 2 We used Lima bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus) to investigate whether herbivore-induced VOCs induce another indirect defence strategy, i.e. the secretion of extrafloral nectar (EFN) in conspecific plant neighbours, and whether this enhances the defence status of the receiving plant under natural conditions. 3 EFN secretion was induced by VOCs released from herbivore-damaged bean tendrils as well as by a synthetic VOC mixture resembling the natural one. One constituent of the herbivore-induced blend – the green leaf volatile (3Z)-hex-3-enyl acetate – was sufficient to elicit the defence reaction. 4 A long-term experiment comparing the defensive effect of EFN alone with the VOC-mediated effect (EFN induction plus attraction of plant defenders) suggested that Lima bean benefits from both indirect defences. Repeated treatment of tendrils with either an artificial blend of VOCs or with EFN led to the attraction of a higher cumulative number of predatory and parasitoid insects (i.e. ants and wasps) as well as to less herbivore damage and an increased production of inflorescences and leaves. 5 Our results demonstrate that one indirect defence mechanism can induce another one in conspecific plants, and that Lima bean plants can benefit from this VOC-induced EFN secretion under natural conditions. Both extrafloral nectaries and the capability to release VOCs upon herbivory are present in many plant taxa and airborne signalling may thus represent a common mechanism for regulating the secretion of EFN in plant parts which face an increased risk of herbivory.},

	abstract = {It is widely reported that plants emit volatile compounds when they are attacked by herbivorous insects, which may be used by parasitoids and predators to locate their host or prey. The study of herbivore-induced plant volatiles and their role in mediating interactions between plants, herbivores and their natural enemies have been primarily based on aboveground systems, generally ignoring the potential interactions between above and belowground infochemical- and food webs. This study examines whether herbivory by Delia radicum feeding on roots of Brassica nigra (black mustard) affects the behaviour of Cotesia glomerata, a parasitoid of the leaf herbivore Pieris brassicae, mediated by changes in plant volatiles. In a semi-field experiment with root-damaged and root-undamaged plants C. glomerata prefers to oviposit in hosts feeding on root-undamaged plants. In addition, in a flight-cage experiment the parasitoid also prefers to search for hosts on plants without root herbivores. Plants exposed to root herbivory were shown to emit a volatile blend characterized by high levels of specific sulphur volatile compounds, which are reported to be highly toxic for insects, combined with low levels of several compounds, i.e. beta-farnesene, reported to act as attractants for herbivorous and carnivorous insects. Our results provide evidence that the foraging behaviour of a parasitoid of an aboveground herbivore can be influenced by belowground herbivores through changes in the plant volatile blend. Such indirect interactions may have profound consequences for the evolution of host selection behaviour in parasitoids, and may play an important role in the structuring and functioning of communities.},

	abstract = {Plant volatiles are known to mediate many important ecological interactions between plants and insects. Plants themselves have also been shown to perceive volatile signals, but the short transmission distances documented thus far in nature raise questions about the ecological significance of plant-to-plant signaling. Recently, we reported that herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) can function within an individual plant to overcome vascular constraints on systemic wound signaling. Within-plant signaling is consistent with the limited distances over which HIPVs have been shown to be perceived by plants. However, it remains unclear why these distance limitations should exist. Such limitations cannot be explained by volatile transport distance alone, since parasitoids respond to HIPVs over much greater distances. Thus, we suggest that the apparent distance limitations on plant-to-plant volatile signaling may arise from the mechanisms by which volatile signals are received by plants. These limitations may reflect physiological constraints on plants’ ability to perceive volatiles or an adaptive mechanism to avoid responding to signals from other plants. Distinguishing between these possibilities will require additional research into the mechanisms of signal reception, about which little is currently known. Deciphering the ecological significance of HIPVs as phytohormones depends on understanding the mechanisms of HIPV reception.},

Emission of HIPV may also contribute to indirect defence by attracting natural enemies of the herbivore. Here, cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) plants (receiver plants) previously exposed to HIPV and subsequently induced through feeding by five Pieris brassicae L. caterpillars attracted more Cotesia glomerata L. parasitoids than control plants. HIPVs to which receiver plants had been exposed were emitted by B. oleracea infested with 50 P. brassicae caterpillars. Control plants had been exposed to volatiles from undamaged plants. In contrast, there were no differences in the attraction of wasps to receiver plants induced through feeding of one or ten larvae of P. brassicae compared to control plants. In addition, RT-PCR demonstrated higher levels of LIPOXYGENASE (BoLOX) transcripts in HIPV-exposed receiver plants. Exposure to HIPV from emitter plants significantly inhibited the growth rate of both P. brassicae and Mamestra brassicae caterpillars compared to growth rates of caterpillars feeding on control receiver plants. Our results demonstrate plant–plant signalling leading to priming of both indirect and direct defence in HIPV-exposed B. oleracea plants.},

However, the mechanisms underlying the observations were not determined, and birch (Betula spp.) has been neglected as a study system for inter-plant interaction ever since. Volatiles released by vegetative plant parts in response to herbivore damage play important roles as signals in plant-to-plant interactions in a range of woody and herbaceous plant species, and also have been shown to mediate signaling between branches of the same plant that have limited vascular connection. We established greenhouse experiments to assess: 1) whether exposure to plant volatiles from herbivore-damaged birches primes defense responses in undamaged neighbors; and 2) whether defenses also are primed in undamaged parts of the same plants with limited vascular connection. We observed a priming of defense responses, which were manifested in an augmented emission of terpenes and aromatic compounds in undamaged conspecific neighbors, and also an augmented emission of green leaf volatiles in systemic branches. Our work provides strong evidence of inter-plant signaling by volatiles, and an intra-plant systemic response in birch. However, the responses are specific, with emissions of different groups of plant volatiles typifying the primed response. This work complements and extends the previous work conducted with a natural population of birches.},

	abstract = {Plants have developed a range of strategies to defend themselves against herbivore attack. Defences can be constitutive, i.e. always present independent of attack, or induced, i.e. only elicited when the plant is under attack. In this thesis, I focused on induced chemical defence responses of plants and the response of associated insects to these phenotypic changes in plants. Herbivore attack is known to induce chemical defences in Brassicaceous plants. Using several elicitors and inhibitors of different steps of the signalling pathways underlying herbivore-induced plant responses, I studied how induced infochemicals affect interactions with associated insects. {\textless}br/{\textgreater} {\textless}br/{\textgreater} Jasmonic acid (JA) is a key plant hormone in the octadecanoid signalling pathway known to be involved in herbivore-induced plant defences. Application of JA can induce plant responses that are similar, although not identical, to herbivore feeding. Two specialist herbivores of Brassicaceous plants, the butterflies Pieris rapae and P. brassicae, preferred to oviposit on non-induced plants over JA-induced plants. Development of P. rapae caterpillars was shown to be reduced, suggesting that oviposition avoidance on JA-induced plants is adaptive. The levels of glucosinolates, secondary metabolites of Brassicaceous plants that are used by Pieris butterflies as oviposition stimulants, could not explain the observed oviposition preference of the butterflies. {\textless}br/{\textgreater} {\textless}br/{\textgreater} JA-induced changes in the plants also affected members of the third trophic level. Volatile emission of JA-induced plants attracted parasitoid wasps to the plants. Parasitoid attraction to JA-induced plants was shown to depend on dose and induction time. However, using JA to induce phenotypic changes had effects different from those induced by herbivores, both chemically and ecologically. Volatile emission of JA-induced and herbivore-induced plants differed; whereas JA-induced plants emitted larger amounts of volatiles, the parasitoids preferred herbivore-induced plants over JA-treated ones. {\textless}br/{\textgreater} {\textless}br/{\textgreater} Early events in plant defence responses, involved in attacker recognition, are damage-induced modulations of ion channel activities resulting in ion imbalances. The fungal elicitor alamethicin, an ion channel-forming peptide mixture, was used to mimic early steps in defence responses. Alamethicin treatment increased attractiveness of plants to parasitoid wasps. Although volatile emission of alamethicin-treated plants was much lower, they were equally attractive as JA-treated plants. This indicates that quality rather than quantity of induced plant volatile blends is important to parasitoids. {\textless}br/{\textgreater} {\textless}br/{\textgreater} Besides chemical elicitation of herbivore-induced responses, which is a widely applied approach, plant defence responses can also be chemically inhibited. This provides the opportunity to inhibit the rate of specific enzymatic steps in a signal-transduction pathway. Furthermore, visual cues associated with feeding damage can be present (and similar) in control- and inhibitor-treated plants. Phenidone is a compound that inhibits lipoxygenase, an enzyme catalyzing an early step in the octadecanoid pathway. Parasitoid attraction was reduced when the plants were treated with phenidone before infestation. {\textless}br/{\textgreater} {\textless}br/{\textgreater} Also herbivore oviposition preference was shown to be affected by inhibition of this signalling pathway. Herbivores can differ in their oviposition preferences. I studied two specialist herbivores with different oviposition preferences: Pieris brassicae avoids oviposition on herbivore-induced plants, whereas Plutella xylostella prefers to oviposit on Pieris-infested plants. I showed that these preferences have a chemical basis and are dependent on octadecanoid signalling, since treatment with the lipoxygenase inhibitor phenidone eliminated herbivore-induced oviposition avoidance or preference. {\textless}br/{\textgreater} {\textless}br/{\textgreater} Thus far, most of the studies on induced plant defences have been done with vegetative plants. However, since reproduction and defence are both processes that require energy and nutrients, this could result in a trade-off. Herbivore feeding on leaves, flowers or roots is known to affect pollinator visitation, but the mechanisms mediating this change have not been addressed. Effects of induction with JA on nectar secretion and pollinator visitation to flowers were investigated. JA-induced plants secreted less nectar, but the sugar concentrations did not change. Also visitation of honeybees and syrphid flies did not change upon JA induction. {\textless}br/{\textgreater} {\textless}br/{\textgreater} These results show the complexity of induced plant defence responses and the variety of behavioural responses of insects on different trophic levels. Combining the phenotypic manipulation approach to induced plant defences, as used in this thesis, with molecular genetic techniques and building on recent developments in plant biochemistry provides a promising way forward towards enhanced understanding of the intricate interactions between plants and insects. {\textless}br/{\textgreater}},

Here we use chemical and behavioural assays to show that these plant emissions can transmit herbivore-specific information that is detectable by parasitic wasps (parasitoids). Tobacco, cotton and maize plants each produce distinct volatile blends in response to damage by two closely related herbivore species, Heliothis virescens and Helicoverpa zea. The specialist parasitic wasp Cardiochiles nigriceps exploits these differences to distinguish infestation by its host, H. virescens, from that by H.zea. The production by phylogenetically diverse plant species and the exploitation by parasitoids of highly specific chemical signals, keyed to individual herbivore species, indicates that the interaction between plants and the natural enemies of the herbivores that attack them is more sophisticated than previously realized.},

In nature, plants are often simultaneously confronted with insect herbivores and phytopathogens, potentially interfering with the attraction of the herbivores' enemies as a result of modifications of the induced volatile blend. Here, we investigated parasitoid (Cotesia glomerata) attraction to volatiles of plants challenged by different attackers, either alone or in combination with Pieris brassicae caterpillars, hosts of C. glomerata. We used a natural system consisting of Brassica nigra plants, eggs and larvae of P. brassicae, Brevicoryne brassicae aphids and the bacterial phytopathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. In all cases, parasitoids successfully located host-infested plants, and wasp foraging behaviour was unaffected by the simultaneous presence of a non-host attacker or host eggs. Analysis of the volatile emissions show that the volatile blends of caterpillar-infested treatments were different from those without caterpillars. Furthermore, dually attacked plants could not be separated from those with only caterpillars, regardless of non-host identity, supporting the behavioural data. Our results suggest that, in this system, indirect plant defences may be more resistant to interference than is generally assumed, with volatiles induced during dual attack remaining reliable indicators of host presence for parasitoids.},

It has been postulated that HIPVs evolved for within-plant signaling and that other organisms subsequently evolved to use them. However, only 7 studies have reported HIPV-mediated within-plant signaling, most conducted in the laboratory or greenhouse. This leaves open the ecological relevance and evolutionary underpinning of the phenomenon. We recently observed within-plant signaling in hybrid aspen under laboratory and field conditions. Greenhouse experiments showed that HIPVs mediated the process.

Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) vary both quantitatively and qualitatively with infestation duration and herbivore density. Thus, whether HIPVs can reliably communicate the identities of herbivores is of interest. Here, we studied the tea plant volatiles induced by the tea leafhopper (Empoasca vitis, a piercing–sucking insect), the tea geometrid (Ectropis oblique, a chewing insect), and methyl jasmonate (MeJA, a plant hormone). Geometrid feeding induced more complex volatile blends than did leafhopper infestation. The volatiles induced by both herbivores significantly increased in quality and quantity with time during the first 16 h of infestation, after which the profiles of induced volatile blends and the emission of induced compounds varied diurnally. (E)-β-Ocimene displayed a unique rhythm in which emission peaked at night. The amount of HIPVs significantly increased, while their profiles changed little, with herbivore density. Overall, the leafhoppers and geometrids induced significantly different volatiles from tea plants, while the HIPV profiles varied with a circadian rhythm and were similar at different herbivore densities. Our findings also suggest a new method of enhancing tea flavor using exogenously applied plant hormones, because the volatiles induced by leafhoppers and MeJA were similar in general composition.},

	abstract = {Upon herbivore attack, plants activate an indirect defense, that is, the release of a complex mixture of volatiles that attract natural enemies of the herbivore. When plants are simultaneously exposed to two herbivore species belonging to different feeding guilds, one herbivore may interfere with the indirect plant defense induced by the other herbivore. However, little is understood about the mechanisms underlying such interference. Here, we address the effect of herbivory by the phloem-feeding whitefly Bemisia tabaci on the induced indirect defense of Arabidopsis thaliana plants to Plutella xylostella caterpillars, that is, the attraction of the parasitoid wasp Diadegma semiclausum. Assays with various Arabidopsis mutants reveal that B. tabaci infestation interferes with indirect plant defense induced by P. xylostella, and that intact jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling are required for such interference caused by B. tabaci. Chemical analysis of plant volatiles showed that the composition of the blend emitted in response to the caterpillars was significantly altered by co-infestation with whiteflies. Moreover, whitefly infestation also had a considerable effect on the transcriptomic response of the plant to the caterpillars. Understanding the mechanisms underlying a plant's responses to multiple attackers will be important for the development of crop protection strategies in a multi-attacker context.},

In this study, we have used two tritrophic systems (Brassica oleracea–Plutella xylostella–Cotesia plutellae and Phaseolus lunatus–Tetranychus urticae–Phytoseiulus persimilis) to show that exposure of plants to moderately enhanced atmospheric O3 levels (60 and 120 nl l−1) results in complete degradation of most herbivore-induced terpenes and GLVs, which is congruent with our hypothesis. However, orientation behavior of natural enemies was not disrupted by O3 exposure in either tritrophic system. Other herbivore-induced volatiles, such as benzyl cyanide, a nitrile in cabbage, and methyl salicylate in lima bean, were not significantly reduced in reactions with O3. We suggest that more atmospherically stable herbivore-induced volatile compounds can provide important long-distance plant-carnivore signals and may be used by natural enemies of herbivores to orientate in O3-polluted environments.},

In contrast, HIPVs may also indicate that plant defenses have been overcome by herbivores infesting the plant; however, studies on this aspect have so far received little attention. Using the interaction of Capsicum annum (Bell pepper) with its pest Scirtothrips dorsalis (Chilli thrips) as a model system, we studied the role of HIPVs in this selected insect–plant interaction. Multiple-choice olfactometer assays with headspace volatiles collected from different growth stages of un-infested C. annum plants represented by pre-flowering (PF), flowering (FL) and fruiting stages (FR) proved FR volatiles to be highly attractive to S. dorsalis. Further, FR plants were infested with S. dorsalis adults and HIPVs released by infested plants were collected and subjected to multiple-choice olfactometer bioassays. Thrips were significantly attracted to HIPVs than to headspace volatiles of un-infested FR plants or thrips body odour. Coupled GC-EAG with S. dorsalis and HIPVs or FR plant volatile revealed specific compounds that elicited an EAG response. Individual EAG-active compounds were less attractive to thrips, however, synthetic blends of EAG-active compounds at the ratio similar to headspace samples were found to be highly attractive. However, when given a choice between synthetic blends of HIPVs and FR, thrips were significantly attracted to synthetic blend of HIPVs. Our study provides empirical data on signals HIPVs may provide to conspecific herbivores and suggests that the role of HIPVs, mostly generalized as defense, may vary based on the interaction and must be studied closely to understand their ecological functions.},

We review evidence for the function of floral volatile signals and conclude that plants are as likely to perceive and respond to floral volatiles as to other, better-studied volatiles.

While systemic defense response can be mediated both via volatile and vascular signals, it is not clear whether common ancestry and/or plant growth forms influence the choice of either mode in planta. We hypothesize that larger woody plants with a complex anatomy should rely more on volatile-mediated signaling, apparently to circumvent vascular restrictions that slow down the communication over a large distance. On the other hand, in smaller herbaceous plants faster systemic response can be achieved via vascular signaling. To investigate whether plant VOCs emission is related to plant phylogeny or growth form, we studied the composition of herbivory-induced plant volatiles in 13 Brassicaceae species representing all four evolutionary lineages, because this family is characterized by both a well-resolved phylogeny and highly diverse growth forms. Our results revealed that woody species consistently emitted a more complex blend of volatiles than herbaceous species. However, phylogenetic relatedness of the species did not explain the observed volatile emission patterns. This emphasizes the influence of growth form, rather than phylogenetic relationships on the variation in plant volatile emissions. Our findings suggest that woody, perennial plant species emit diverse VOCs, likely because these compounds comprise a more efficient mode of defense response in these large, anatomically complex plants.},

Theory predicts that HIPVs may initially have evolved because of their direct benefits for the emitter and were subsequently adopted as infochemicals. Here, we investigated the potential direct benefits of indole, a major HIPV constituent of many plant species and a key defence priming signal in maize. We used indole-deficient maize mutants and synthetic indole at physiologically relevant doses to document the impact of the volatile on the generalist herbivore Spodoptera littoralis. Our experiments demonstrate that indole directly decreases food consumption, plant damage and survival of S. littoralis caterpillars. Surprisingly, exposure to volatile indole increased caterpillar growth. Furthermore, we show that S. littoralis caterpillars and adults consistently avoid indole-producing plants in olfactometer experiments, feeding assays and oviposition trials. Synthesis. Together, these results provide a potential evolutionary trajectory by which the release of a HIPV as a direct defence precedes its use as a cue by herbivores and an alert signal by plants. Furthermore, our experiments show that the effects of a plant secondary metabolite on weight gain and food consumption can diverge in a counterintuitive manner, which implies that larval growth can be a poor proxy for herbivore fitness and plant resistance.},

	abstract = {Plant-emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) mediate interactions within a plant community. Typically, receiving a signal from a damaged neighbour enhances the defensive attributes of a receiver plant. The mechanisms underlying plant–plant interactions may be divided into active and passive processes, both of which involve transit of VOCs between plants and are vulnerable to environmental perturbation. Numerous studies have documented between-plant interactions, but the specific effects on a receiver plant's interactions with herbivores have received little attention. Moreover, the relative contributions of active and passive processes to plant defence and the effects of environmental pollutants on the processes have been largely unexplored. We used a system comprising Brassica oleracea var. italica (broccoli) and the specialist herbivore Plutella xylostella to test whether plants previously exposed to herbivore-damaged neighbours differed from nonexposed plants in their susceptibility to oviposition. We then investigated the roles of active and passive mechanisms in our observations and whether differences in susceptibility remained under elevated ozone concentrations. Plants exposed to herbivore-damaged neighbours were more susceptible to oviposition than plants exposed to undamaged neighbours, which indicates associational susceptibility. Mechanistically, active and passive volatile-mediated processes occurred in tandem with the passive process – involving adsorption of sesquiterpenes to receiver plants – appearing to structure the oviposition response. Exposure to ozone rapidly degraded the sesquiterpenes and eliminated the associational susceptibility. Plant volatiles have typically been thought to play roles in between-plant interactions and to promote receiver plant defence. Here, we show that receiver plants may also become more susceptible to oviposition and thus more likely to be damaged. Extensive disruption of volatile-mediated interactions by an atmospheric pollutant highlights the need to consider the pervading environment and changes therein when assessing their ecological significance.},

Here, we take a modelling approach to elucidate which physicochemical and physiological properties contribute to the information value of a HIPV. A leaf-level HIPV synthesis and emission model is developed and parameterized to poplar. Next, HIPV concentrations within the canopy are inferred as a function of dispersion, transport and chemical degradation of the compounds. We show that the ability of HIPVs to reveal herbivory varies from almost perfect to no better than chance and interacts with canopy conditions. Model predictions matched well with leaf-emission measurements and field and laboratory assays. The chemical class a compound belongs to predicted the signalling ability of a compound only to a minor extent, whereas compound characteristics such as its reaction rate with atmospheric oxidants, biosynthesis rate upon herbivory and volatility were much more important predictors.

Treating leaves with a protein-synthesis inhibitor prior to infesting them with spider mites completely suppressed the production of herbivore-induced volatiles in the infested leaves. Conversely, inhibitor treatment to uninfested leaves prior to exposure to volatiles from infested leaves did not affect the emission of volatiles from the exposed, uninfested leaves. This evidence supports the hypothesis that response of the exposed downwind plant is passive. T. urticae-infested leaves that had been previously exposed to volatiles from infested leaves emitted more herbivore-induced volatiles than T. urticae-infested leaves previously exposed to volatiles from uninfested leaves. The former leaves were also more attractive to the predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis, than the latter. This shows that previous exposure of plants to volatiles from herbivore-infested neighbors results in a stronger response of plants in terms of predator attraction when herbivores damage the plant. This supports the hypothesis that the downwind uninfested plant is actively involved. Both adsorption and production of volatiles can mediate the attraction of carnivorous mites to plants that have been exposed to volatiles from infested neighbors.},

	abstract = {Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPV) are emitted by plants in response to herbivory and attract natural enemies of herbivores, thereby inducing an important indirect defence against herbivores. Evidence supports the hypothesis that plants become more defensive against herbivores after exposure to HIPV and that this is a type of priming, or preparation by the plant perceiving an HIPV signal to respond to herbivory. We report the priming of two induced indirect defences: HIPV-mediated induction of predator attraction and the secretion of extrafloral nectar (EFN), known as an alternative food source for natural enemies of herbivores. When uninfested lima bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus) were exposed to HIPV, the plants attracted more predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis) and secreted larger amounts of EFN than unexposed plants. Further, when HIPV-exposed plants were infested by spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) for 2 days, the plants attracted more predators and secreted larger amounts of EFN than plants that were infested for 2 days after exposure to uninfested plant volatiles. However, there were no differences in the attraction and the EFN secretion when they were infested for 4 days. Predatory mites survived longer when supplied with EFN and stayed longer on uninfested plants that had been supplemented with additional extrafloral nectar. From these results, we conclude that the priming of HIPV-exposed plants recruits predators and induces the secretion of EFN that functions to protect the plants before and after herbivory.},

	abstract = {Induced or constitutive production of secondary metabolites is a successful plant defence strategy against herbivores which can be mediated by plant associated micro-organisms. Several grass species can be associated with an endophytic fungus of the genus Epichloë which produces herbivore toxic or deterring alkaloids. Besides these direct defences, herbivorous insects are controlled via indirect plant defence mechanisms by attracting predators. Recent studies indicate that Epichloë endophytes can improve the grass emitted volatile organic compounds towards herbivore deterrence. Due to their defensive mutualistic function, we hypothesize that Epichloë altered plant volatiles can attract aphid predators and contribute to an increased indirect plant defence. With a common garden study, we show that hoverfly (Syrphidae) larvae and pupae were more abundant on endophyte-infected plants compared to uninfected plants. Our results indicate that the Epichloë endophyte provides, besides direct defence (alkaloid), indirect plant defence by improving the plant odor attracting more olfactory foraging aphid predators. Future research is needed in order to understand: (I) whether endophyte-mediated changes in plant volatiles are induced herbivore specific, (II) whether there is a trade-off between endophyte-mediated direct and indirect plant defence, (III) whether the endophyte produces volatiles or induces a change in plant-derived volatiles, (IV) the role of plant signals in endophyte-mediated plant defence.},

	abstract = {Invasive insect herbivores have the potential to interfere with native multitrophic interactions by affecting the chemical cues emitted by plants and disrupting the attraction of natural enemies mediated by herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). In a previous study, we found that the presence of the exotic herbivore Spodoptera littoralis on Brassica rapa plants infested by the native herbivore Pieris brassicae makes these dually-infested plants unattractive to the main parasitoid of P. brassicae, the braconid wasp Cotesia glomerata. Here we show that this interference by S. littoralis is strongly dependent on the relative densities of the two herbivores. Parasitoids were only deterred by dually-infested plants when there were more S. littoralis larvae than P. brassicae larvae on a plant. Furthermore, the blend of HIPVs emitted by dually-infested plants differed the most from HIPVs emitted by Pieris-infested plants when S. littoralis density exceeded P. brassicae density. We further found that associative learning by the parasitoid affected its preferences: attraction to dually-infested plants increased after parasitoids were presented a P. brassicae caterpillar (rewarding experience) in presence of the odor of a dually-infested plant, but not when presented a S. littoralis caterpillar (non-rewarding experience). A non-rewarding experience prior to the bioassays resulted in a general decrease in parasitoid motivation to respond to plant odors. We conclude that herbivore density and associative learning may play an important role in the foraging behavior of natural enemies in communities, and such effects should not be overlooked when investigating the ecological impact of exotic species on native food webs.},

	url = {https://ir-library.ku.ac.ke/handle/123456789/6057},
	abstract = {Plants have evolved direct and indirect defence strategies against attacking organisms. Directly, they produce toxins, digestion inhibitors and herbivore- induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) repellent to phytophagous insects; indirectly they use HIPVs to attract natural enemies antagonistic to the herbivore. Previous studies on maize, Zea mays, have shown that feeding by herbivorous insects induce the crop to emit volatiles attractive. to natural enemies. An often overlooked aspect is that there may be genotypic variation in these indirect plant defence traits within plant species. Moreover, little has been known about the reaction of maize plants to egg deposition. Results from the current study showed emission of HIPV semiochemicals by certain maize landraces in response to egg deposition by spotted stemborer Chilo partellus Swinhoe (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), a major insect pest of maize in sub-Saharan Africa. In behavioual study, volatiles from maize exposed to egg deposition were preferred by key egg parasitoid Trichogramma bournieri Pintureau (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) and the larval parasitoid Cotesia sesamiae Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) to volatiles from unexposed plants. Moreover, volatiles collected systemically from egg free leaves of plants exposed to C. partellus oviposition were also attractive, indicating production of the defence signals is not limited to site of egg deposition but emitted systemically throughout the plant. Preference of larval parasitoid C. sesmiae to odours of egg-induced plants underscores the intriguing degree of sophistication in the landrace's indirect defence enabling them to alert larval parasitoid bodyguards against future herbivory. Similarly, volatiles from maize landraces treated with ethanolic egg extract were attractive to parasitoids which provided evidence that material coating C. partellus eggs, and causing them to adhere to plant leaves, contains an elicitor that induces the emission of HIPVs. GC-coupled electrophysiological recording with attractive samples revealed that C. sesamiae was responsive to ten volatile organic compounds, namely, (E)-ocimene, (R)-linalool, (E)-4,8-dimethyl- 1,3,7-nonatriene, methyl salicylate, decanal, methyl eugenol, (E)-caryophyllene, u- bergamotene, (E)-{\textasciitilde}farnesene and (E,E)-4,8, 12-trimethyl-l ,3,7,11 tridecatetraene. Volatile analysis by GC and GC-MS revealed marked increases in emission of these compounds in maize landraces exposed to stemborer oviposition compared to unexposed. In contrast, volatiles collected from standard hybrid commercial varieties exposed to eggs were not attractive to bothparasitoids, implying the ability to produce the defence volatile signals might have been lost during breeding processes. Preliminary molecular investigation revealed high transcript levels of gene encoding for an important sequiterpene synthase implicated in indirect maize landrace defence against stemborer after herbivory. By providing more insight into the existing knowledge of stemborer-maize-natural enemy tritrophic interaction, results from the current study pave way for designing novel and ecologically sound pest management strategies against damaging crop pests  
like C. partellus.},

	abstract = {Insect herbivory activates plant defense mechanisms and releases a blend of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). These volatile compounds may be involved in plant-plant communication and induce defense response in undamaged plants. In this work, we investigated whether the exposure of sweet pepper plants to HIPVs [(Z)-3-hexenol, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate, (Z)-3-hexenyl butanoate, hexyl butanoate, methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate] activates the sweet pepper immune defense system. For this, healthy sweet pepper plants were individually exposed to the each of the above mentioned HIPVs over 48 h. The expression of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid related genes was quantified. Here, we show that all the tested volatiles induced plant defenses by upregulating the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signaling pathway. Additionally, the response of Frankliniella occidentalis, a key sweet pepper pest, and Orius laevigatus, the main natural enemy of F. occidentalis, to HIPV-exposed sweet pepper plants were studied in a Y-tube olfactometer. Only plants exposed to (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate and methyl salicylate repelled F. occidentalis whereas O. laevigatus showed a strong preference to plants exposed to (Z)-3-hexenol, (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate, (Z)-3-hexenyl butanoate, methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate. Our results show that HIPVs act as elicitors to sweet pepper plant defenses by enhancing defensive signaling pathways. We anticipate our results to be a starting point for integrating HIPVs-based approaches in sweet pepper pest management systems which may provide a sustainable strategy to manage insect pests in horticultural plants.},

	abstract = {It is well established that plants infested with a single herbivore species can attract specific natural enemies through the emission of herbivore-induced volatiles. However, it is less clear what happens when plants are simultaneously attacked by more than one species. We analyzed volatile emissions of lima bean and cucumber plants upon multi-species herbivory by spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) and caterpillars (Spodoptera exigua) in comparison to single-species herbivory. Upon herbivory by single or multiple species, lima bean and cucumber plants emitted volatile blends that comprised mostly the same compounds. To detect additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects, we compared the multi-species herbivory volatile blend with the sum of the volatile blends induced by each of the herbivore species feeding alone. In lima bean, the majority of compounds were more strongly induced by multi-species herbivory than expected based on the sum of volatile emissions by each of the herbivores separately, potentially caused by synergistic effects. In contrast, in cucumber, two compounds were suppressed by multi-species herbivory, suggesting the potential for antagonistic effects. We also studied the behavioral responses of the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis, a specialized natural enemy of spider mites. Olfactometer experiments showed that P. persimilis preferred volatiles induced by multi-species herbivory to volatiles induced by S. exigua alone or by prey mites alone. We conclude that both lima bean and cucumber plants effectively attract predatory mites upon multi-species herbivory, but the underlying mechanisms appear different between these species.},

Signals can also be transferred between plants via different mechanisms, which we classify as wired- and wireless communications. Wired communications involve direct signal transfers between plants mediated by mycorrhizal hyphae and parasitic plant stems. Wireless communications involve plant volatile emissions and root exudates elicited by microbes/insects, which enable inter-plant signalling without physical contact. These producer-plant signals induce microbiome adaptation in receiver plants via facilitative or competitive mechanisms.

Changes in herbivore-induced VOC emissions are known to occur in transgenic plants engineered to express resistance to insects (mainly Bt-plants), not only as a result of modified insect behavior but also as a result of altered resource allocation. Transgenic glyphosate-resistant plants express a variant of the enzyme EPSPS (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) that is insensitive to the herbicide glyphosate. This enzyme is essential in metabolic routes that result in the synthesis of amino acids and secondary metabolites. We addressed whether the constitutive and Anticarsia gemmatalis-induced emissions of VOCs from a transgenic soybean line differ from those of the isoline, and whether changes may interfere in the foraging behavior of the predatory bug Podisus nigrispinus. Analyses showed that both herbivory and genotype influenced VOC emissions. In addition, the genotype affected the herbivore-induced VOC emission. Larger emissions were measured in the transgenic line than the non-transgenic line upon herbivory. The bioassays showed that P. nigrispinus significantly discriminated only between the odors of undamaged and damaged plants of the non-transgenic line. No preference was observed for herbivore-damaged plants of any of the two lines over the other. The results from this study suggest that despite a greater emission of volatiles the predators are less able to discriminate between herbivore-damaged and undamaged transgenic plants. This condition does not necessarily increase the preference of the predator for damaged non-transgenic plants over transgenic plants. This study opens possibilities for new studies of chemical ecology in tritrophic systems to assess the effect of transgenic glyphosate-resistant plants.},

	abstract = {Locating a host plant is crucial for a phytophagous (herbivorous) insect to fulfill its nutritional requirements and to find suitable oviposition sites. Insects can locate their hosts even though the host plants are often hidden among an array of other plants. Plant volatiles play an important role in this host-location process. The recognition of a host plant by these olfactory signals could occur by using either species-specific compounds or specific ratios of ubiquitous compounds. Currently, most studies favor the second scenario, with strong evidence that plant discrimination is due to central processing of olfactory signals by the insect, rather than their initial detection. Furthermore, paired or clustered olfactory receptor neurons might enable fine-scale spatio-temporal resolution of the complex signals encountered when ubiquitous compounds are used.},

In this article, we review the recent progess made by research into the interactions between PGPR VOCs and plants, focusing on VOC emission by PGPR strains in plants. Particular attention is given to the mechanisms by which these bacterial VOCs elicit ISR. We provide an overview of recent progress in the elucidation of PGPR VOC interactions from studies utilizing transcriptome, metabolome, and proteome analyses. By monitoring defense gene expression patterns, performing 2-dimensional electrophoresis, and studying defense signaling null mutants, salicylic acid and ethylene have been found to be key players in plant signaling pathways involved in the ISR response. Bacterial VOCs also confer induced systemic tolerance to abiotic stresses, such as drought and heavy metals. A review of current analytical approaches for PGPR volatile profiling is also provided with needed future developments emphasized. To assess potential utilization of PGPR VOCs for crop plants, volatile suspensions have been applied to pepper and cucumber roots and found to be effective at protecting plants against plant pathogens and insect pests in the field. Taken together, these studies provide further insight into the biological and ecological potential of PGPR VOCs for enhancing plant self-immunity and/or adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses in modern agriculture.},

	abstract = {Many plant species defend themselves against herbivorous insects indirectly by producing volatiles in response to herbivory. These volatiles attract carnivorous enemies of the herbivores. Research on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. has contributed considerably to the unraveling of signal transduction pathways involved in direct plant defense mechanisms against pathogens. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis is also a good candidate for studying signal transduction pathways involved in indirect defense mechanisms by showing that: (1) Adult females of Cotesia rubecula, a specialist parasitic wasp of Pieris rapae caterpillars, are attracted to P. rapae-infested Arabidopsis plants. (2) Arabidopsis infested by P. rapae emits volatiles from several major biosynthetic pathways, including terpenoids and green leaf volatiles. The blends from herbivore-infested and artificially damaged plants are similar. However, differences can be found with respect to a few components of the blend, such as two nitriles and the monoterpene myrcene, that were produced exclusively by caterpillar-infested plants, and methyl salicylate, that was produced in larger amounts by caterpillar-infested plants. (3) Genes from major biosynthetic pathways involved in volatile production are induced by caterpillar feeding. These include AtTPS10, encoding a terpene synthase involved in myrcene production, AtPAL1, encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase involved in methyl salicylate production, and AtLOX2 and AtHPL, encoding lipoxygenase and hydroperoxide lyase, respectively, both involved in the production of green leaf volatiles. AtAOS, encoding allene oxide synthase, involved in the production of jasmonic acid, also was induced by herbivory.},

Lepidoptera identify plants for oviposition and exploit them as larval food sources to complete their development. In turn, plants adopt different strategies to overcome and limit herbivorous damages. The insect egg deposition on leaves can already induce a number of defense responses in several plant species. This minireview deals with the main features involved in the interaction between plants and lepidopteran egg-laying, focusing on responses from both insect and plant side. We discuss different aspects of direct and indirect plant responses triggered by lepidopteran oviposition. In particular, we focus our attention on the mechanisms underlying egg-induced plant defenses that can i) directly damage the eggs such as localized hypersensitive response (HR)-like necrosis, neoplasm formation, production of ovicidal compounds and ii) indirect defenses, such as production of oviposition-induced plant volatiles (OIPVs) used to attract natural enemies (parasitoids) able to kill the eggs or hatching larvae. We provide an overview of chemical, physiological, and molecular egg-mediated plant responses induced by both specialist and generalist lepidopteran species, also dealing with effectors, elicitors, and chemical signals involved in the process. Egg-associated microorganisms are also discussed, although little is known about this third partner participating in plant-lepidopteran interactions.},

Although the induction of this ‘cry for help’ has been well documented, only a few studies have investigated the inhibition of HIPVs by herbivores and little is known about whether herbivores have evolved mechanisms to inhibit the release of HIPVs. To examine the role of herbivore effectors in modulating HIPVs and stomatal dynamics, we conducted series of experiments combining pharmacological, surgical, genetic (CRISPR-Cas9) and chemical (GC-MS analysis) approaches. We show that the salivary enzyme, glucose oxidase (GOX), secreted by the caterpillar Helicoverpa zea on leaves, causes stomatal closure in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) within 5 min, and in both tomato and soybean (Glycine max) for at least 48 h. GOX also inhibits the emission of several HIPVs during feeding by H. zea, including (Z)-3-hexenol, (Z)-jasmone and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, which are important airborne signals in plant defenses. Our findings highlight a potential adaptive strategy where an insect herbivore inhibits plant airborne defenses during feeding by exploiting the association between stomatal dynamics and HIPV emission.},

Such interactions include the detection and capture of animal prey by carnivorous plants, active plant responses to pollinator visitation, the perception of various cues associated with the immediate presence and feeding of herbivores, and plant responses to (olfactory) cues indicating the threat of future herbivory. We are only beginning to understand the full range of sensory cues that mediate such interactions and to elucidate the mechanisms by which plants perceive, interpret, and respond to them. Nevertheless, it is clear that plants continually gather information about their environments via a range of sensory modalities and actively respond in ways that profoundly influence their interactions with other organisms.},

Here, we investigated HIPVs emitted from tea (Camellia sinensis) plants, an important crop used for beverages, and their involvement in tea plant-to-plant signaling. To ensure uniform and sufficient exposure to HIPVs, jasmonic acid combined with mechanical damage (JAMD) was used to simulate herbivore attacks. Metabonomics techniques based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were employed to determine metabolite changes in undamaged tea plants exposed to JAMD-stimulated volatiles. JAMD-stimulated volatiles mainly enhanced the amounts of 1-O-galloyl-6-O-luteoyl-α-d-glucose, assamicain C, 2,3,4,5-tetrahydroxy-6-oxohexyl gallate, quercetagitrin, 2-(2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-4-oxo-4H-chromen-8-yl)-4,5-dihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl, 3,4-dimethoxybenzoate, 1,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydroxyheptan-2-one, and methyl gallate in neighboring undamaged tea leaves. Furthermore, α-farnesene and β-ocimene, which were produced after JAMD treatments, were identified as two main JAMD-stimulated volatiles altering metabolite profiles of the neighboring undamaged tea leaves. This research advances our understanding of the ecological functions of HIPVs and can be used to develop crop biological control agents against pest insects in the future.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This thesis explores whether aphid-infestation interferes with the plant response to chewing herbivores and whether this impacts performance and behaviour of individual chewing insect herbivores and their natural enemies, as well as the entire insect community. I investigated this using three wild cabbage populations ({\textless}em{\textgreater}Brassica oleracea{\textless}/em{\textgreater}) that are known to differ in inducible secondary chemistry, to reveal whether patterns were consistent.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}A literature review on recent developments in the field of plant interactions with multiple herbivores (Chapter 2) addressed how plant traits mediate interactions with various species of the associated insect community and their dynamics. In addition, the mechanisms underlying phenotypic changes in response to different herbivores were discussed from the expression of defence-related genes, phytohormones and secondary metabolites in plants to their effects on the performance and behaviour of individual insects as well as the entire insect community. In Chapter 3, I investigated the effects of early-season infestation by the aphid {\textless}em{\textgreater}Brevicoryne brassicae{\textless}/em{\textgreater} on the composition and dynamics of the entire insect community throughout the season in a garden experiment replicated in two consecutive years. Aphid infestation in the early season only affected a subset of the community, {\textless}em{\textgreater}i.e.{\textless}/em{\textgreater} the natural enemies of aphids, but not the chewing herbivores and their natural enemies. Moreover, the effects were only significant in the first half (June \& July), but waned in the second half of the season (August \& September). The effect of aphid infestation on the community of natural enemies also varied among the cabbage populations. Chapter 4 investigated the effects of aphid infestation on plant direct defences against chewing herbivores in laboratory experiments by comparing the performance of chewing herbivores and their parasitoids on aphid-infested and aphid-free plants. The performance of the specialist herbivore {\textless}em{\textgreater}Plutella xylostella{\textless}/em{\textgreater} and its parasitoid {\textless}em{\textgreater}Diadegma semiclausum{\textless}/em{\textgreater} was better on plants infested with aphids than on aphid-free plants, whereas the performance of the generalist herbivore {\textless}em{\textgreater}Mamestra brassicae{\textless}/em{\textgreater} and its parasitoid {\textless}em{\textgreater}Microplitis mediator{\textless}/em{\textgreater} was not affected by aphid infestation. These results suggest that aphid induced changes in plant traits may differentially affect the performance of leaf-chewing herbivore species attacking the same host plant, and also varied among the cabbage populations. Chapter 5 examined the effects of {\textless}em{\textgreater}B. brassicae{\textless}/em{\textgreater} aphid infestation on plant indirect defences against chewing herbivores. In a two-choice olfactometer bioassay, preference behaviour for volatiles emitted by plants infested with hosts alone and those emitted by plants infested with aphids and hosts was compared for {\textless}em{\textgreater}D. semiclausum{\textless}/em{\textgreater} and{\textless}em{\textgreater} M mediator, {\textless}/em{\textgreater}larval endoparasitoids of caterpillars of {\textless}em{\textgreater}P. xylostella{\textless}/em{\textgreater} and {\textless}em{\textgreater}M. brassicae{\textless}/em{\textgreater}, respectively. In addition, the headspace volatiles emitted by host-infested and dually-infested plants were collected and analyzed. Co-infestation with aphids differentially affected volatile-mediated foraging behaviour of the two parasitoid species in an infestation period-dependent manner. {\textless}em{\textgreater}Diadegma semiclausum{\textless}/em{\textgreater} preferred dually infested plants over host-infested plants when aphids infested the plants for a short time period, {\textless}em{\textgreater}i.e.{\textless}/em{\textgreater} 7 days, but the volatile preference of {\textless}em{\textgreater}D. semiclausum{\textless}/em{\textgreater} was reversed when aphid infestation was extended to 14 days. In contrast, {\textless}em{\textgreater}M. mediator {\textless}/em{\textgreater}consistently preferred volatiles emitted by the dually-infested plants over those emitted by host-infested plants. The patterns of preference behaviour of the two wasp species were consistent across the three cabbage populations. Interestingly, the emission rate of most volatile compounds was reduced in plants dually-infested with caterpillars and aphids compared to singly-infested with caterpillars. This study showed that aphid infestation increased plant indirect defences against caterpillars, but depended on the aphid infestation period and specific caterpillar-parasitoid association. We hypothesized a negative interference of aphid infestation on plant defences against chewing herbivores based on previously reported SA-JA antagonism. In Chapter 6, we assessed the activation of SA and JA signaling pathways in plants infested by both aphids ({\textless}em{\textgreater}B. brassicae{\textless}/em{\textgreater}) and various caterpillar species ({\textless}em{\textgreater}P. xylostella, M. brassicae {\textless}/em{\textgreater}and{\textless}em{\textgreater} Pieris brassicae{\textless}/em{\textgreater}) in different time sequences by quantifying transcription levels of the SA- and JA-responsive marker genes, {\textless}em{\textgreater}PR-1{\textless}/em{\textgreater} and {\textless}em{\textgreater}LOX{\textless}/em{\textgreater} respectively. The results did not provide support for SA-JA antagonism. Compared to single infestation with each of the herbivore species, dual infestation with aphid and caterpillars had no interactive effects on the transcription levels of the SA- and JA-responsive maker genes, regardless of the temporal sequence of aphid and caterpillar attack, or the identity of the attacking caterpillar species.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The findings of this thesis contribute to our understanding of plant responses to herbivory by insect species belonging to different feeding guilds and their ecological effects on other associated community members. Aphid infestation may interfere with plant direct and indirect defences against leaf-chewing herbivores at the individual species level, but the effects are species-specific and also depend on the infestation period of aphids. Early-season aphid infestation may further affect the composition of the insect community, but the effect is smaller influencing only a subset of the community compared to early infestation by chewing herbivores. The molecular mechanism underlying plant responses to both phloem-feeding and leaf-chewing herbivores are complex and require the investigation of a range of genes involved in JA- and SA-mediated defence signal transduction. Plant interact with multiple herbivores at different levels of biological organization ranging from the subcellular level to the individual and the community level, and an integrated multidisciplinary approach is required to investigate plant-insect interactions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In addition to induced direct defence, plants can defend themselves indirectly by improving the effectiveness of enemies of herbivores. Plants can respond to arthropod herbivory with the induction of a blend of volatiles that attracts predators and/or parasitoids of herbivores. Carnivorous arthropods can discriminate between infested plants and mechanically woundcd plants, and between plants infested by different herbivore species. The volatile blends emitted by different plant species infested by the same herbivore species show large qualitative differences, whereas blends emitted by plants of the same species, but infested by different herbivore species are mostly qualitatively similar with quantitative variation. Carnivores can discriminate between blends that differ qualitatively and/or quantitatively. However, it remains unknown what differences in blends arc used by carnivorous arthropods in this discrimination. Signal transduction pathways involved in the induction of direct and indirect defence seem to overlap. Direct and indirect defence may interfere with each other's effectiveness. For application of direct and indirect defence in agriculture, it is important to compare the relative importance of these two defence types in the same plant species.},

	abstract = {Signal-based induced indirect defence refers to herbivore-induced production of plant volatiles that attract carnivorous natural enemies of herbivores. Relationships between direct and indirect defence strategies were studied using tritrophic systems consisting of six sympatric willow species, willow leaf beetles (Plagiodera versicolora), and their natural predators, ladybeetles (Aiolocaria hexaspilota). Relative preferences of ladybeetles for prey-infested willow plant volatiles, indicating levels of signal-based induced indirect defence, were positively correlated with the vulnerability of willow species to leaf beetles, assigned as relative levels of direct defence. This correlation suggested a possible trade-off among the species, in terms of resource limitation between direct defence and signal-based induced indirect defence. However, analyses of volatiles from infested and uninfested plants showed that the specificity of infested volatile blends (an important factor determining the costs of signal-based induced indirect defence) did not affect the attractiveness of infested plant volatiles. Thus, the suggested trade-off in resource limitation was unlikely. Rather, principal coordinates analysis showed that this ‘apparent trade-off’ between direct and signal-based induced indirect defence was partially explained by differential preferences of ladybeetles to infested plant volatiles of the six willow species. We also showed that relative preferences of ladybeetles for prey-infested willow plant volatiles were positively correlated with oviposition preferences of leaf beetles and with the distributions of leaf beetles in the field. These correlations suggest that ladybeetles use the specificity of infested willow plant volatiles to find suitable prey patches.},

In this way, the plant acquires protection and the bodyguards gain food. These plant signals cause neighboring plants, not under attack, to release signals as well. We hypothesize that such “secondary” signals help to reduce damage from future herbivore attacks by the protection received from the bodyguards. By modeling we explore the conditions for such secondary signals to evolve. Three kinds of strategies are considered: plants of the first strategy always emit a signal, those of the second strategy emit a signal only when infested, and those of the third strategy emit a signal not only when infested, but also when a certain number of neighbors are infested (i.e. secondary signaling). When signaling is much less (much more) costly than damage from herbivory, the first (second) strategy will be favored by selection, whereas for intermediate costs the third strategy, i.e. secondary signaling, will evolve. However, secondary signaling will not evolve when the primary signals lure the bodyguards too effectively. This is because the undamaged plant gains associational defense when the infested individual is defending very well; therefore, the need for secondary signaling decreases.},

To date, this research field has been restricted to the question whether and how plants (in general) are involved in plant-to-plant communication. However, apart from mechanistic questions, evolutionary questions should be addressed asking why plants do (or do not) exploit their neighbour's information and whether their strategy is affected by e.g. environmental conditions or previous experience.

We examined the effects of inbreeding on constitutive and herbivore-induced volatile emissions in horsenettle (Solanum carolinense L.) and on the composition of the insect community attracted to herbivore-damaged and undamaged plants in the field. Inbred plants exhibited higher constitutive emissions, but weaker induction of volatiles following herbivory. Moreover, many individual compounds previously implicated in the recruitment of predators and parasitoids (e.g. terpenes) were induced relatively weakly (or not at all) in inbred plants. In trapping experiments, undamaged inbred plants attracted greater numbers of generalist insect herbivores than undamaged outcrossed plants. But inbred plants recruited fewer herbivore natural enemies (predators and parasitoids) when damaged. Taken together, these findings suggest that inbreeding depression negatively impacts the overall pattern of volatile emissions – increasing the apparency of undamaged plants to herbivores, while reducing the recruitment of predatory insects to herbivore-damaged plants.},

Variability in the released blend may exist on the whole-plant and withinplant level and can affect the foraging efficiency of parasitoids. We comprehensively assessed the kinetics of herbivore-induced volatiles in soybean in the context of growth stage, plant organ, leaf age, and direction of signal transport. The observed patterns were used to test the predictions of the optimal defence hypothesis (OD). We found that plants in the vegetative stage emitted 10-fold more volatiles per biomass than reproductive plants and young leaves emitted {\textgreater}2.6 times more volatiles than old leaves. Systemic induction in single leaves was stronger and faster by one day in acropetal than in basipetal direction while no systemic induction was found in pods. Herbivore-damaged leaves had a 200-fold higher release rate than pods. To some extent these findings support the OD: i) indirect defence levels were increased in response to herbivory and ii) young leaves, which are more valuable, emitted more volatiles. However, the fact that reproductive structures emitted no constitutive or very few inducible volatiles is in seeming contrast to the OD predictions. We argue that in case of volatile emission the OD can only partially explain the patterns of defence allocation due to the peculiarity that volatiles act as signals not as toxins or repellents.},

The volatiles are attractive for a natural antagonist of the herbivore, the parasitoid Cotesia glomerata. Parasitoids are attracted only if additional damage is inflicted on the systemically induced upper leaves and only after at least three days of herbivore feeding on the lower leaves. Upon termination of caterpillar feeding, the systemic signal is emitted for a maximum of one more day. Systemic induction did not occur at low levels of herbivore infestation. Systemically induced leaves emitted green leaf volatiles, cyclic monoterpenoids, and sesquiterpenes. GC-MS profiles of systemically induced and herbivore-infested leaves did not differ for most compounds, although herbivore infested plants did emit higher amounts of green leaf volatiles. Emission of systemically induced volatiles in Brussels sprouts might function as an induced defense that is activated only when needed, i.e., at the time of caterpillar attack. This way, plants may adopt a flexible management of inducible defensive resources to minimize costs of defense and to maximize fitness in response to unpredictable herbivore attack.},

These altered blends can attract the herbivore’s natural antagonists, and such herbivore-induced volatile blends have often been interpreted as co-evolved plant–insect antagonist signals. When comparing volatile profiles of infested Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera L. plants (Brassicales: Brassicaceae), on which Brevicoryne brassicae L. (Hemiptera: Aphididae) aphids are feeding, with previously infested plants (i.e., deprived of aphids four hours prior to volatile collection), we found that the emission of a particular volatile compound, the glucosinolate breakdown product allyl isothiocyanate, was significantly higher in the latter. We used dual choice olfactometry to evaluate attractiveness of plants and aphids to Diaeretiella rapae (M’Intosh 1855) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a parasitoid of B. brassicae. Previously infested plants deprived of the herbivore attracted significantly more parasitoids than infested plants, although aphid odours per se proved to be attractive. Mechanical damage approximating aphid stylet insertion remained without effect on emission of allyl isothiocyanate and on parasitoid response. The unexpected higher parasitoid attraction to previously infested than infested plants is discussed here from the perspective of the plant and the parasitoid, as well as from the herbivore. Results suggest that while the host-finding mechanism of D. rapae has not evolved to allow this parasitoid a discrimination between herbivore-infested and previously infested plants, the herbivore seems able to suppress emission of a key volatile, thereby reducing its own olfactory detectability to its specialised natural antagonist.},

These chemicals are used by insect parasitoids as sources of information that aid in finding hosts. It is unclear how biotic and abiotic factors interact to affect blend composition and the ability of insects to interpret signals. Here, we present a novel stimulus-space model, and use it to examine patterns of VOC emission. In field experiments, we manipulated herbivory levels and collected VOCs in a population of wild Datura wrightii, while simultaneously measuring key abiotic factors. We mirrored field experiments under controlled conditions in the lab, and used both sets of data to test predictions made by our proposed model. VOC blends were structured mainly by variation in abiotic factors, not herbivory. However, linear discriminant analysis showed that it is possible to distinguish different herbivory levels. We show that most compounds produced by D. wrightii are invariant, or respond solely to environmental variation or herbivory. Our results suggest that blend composition may be under selection for noise reduction, to maximize responses from potential receivers, and that abiotic variation can act as potentially strong sources of noise in chemical communication displays.},

	abstract = {Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released and utilized by various organisms starting from bacteria to higher organisms. The VOCs produced from plants are involved in self-repairing against biological and nonbiological insults as well as in communicating with neighbouring plants and other organisms for reasons such as priming and pollination. The VOCs produced by plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria have immense capability of modulating plant growth and development, eliciting induced systemic resistance against biotic and abiotic stressors, and conferring stress tolerance. These bacterial volatiles also have direct anti-phytopathogenic (bacterial and fungal) and anti-phytoparasitic nematode activities, which in turn benefit plants indirectly. Additionally, bacterial volatiles are found to be involved in Quorum Sensing (QS), a coordinated multicellular behaviour. Sometimes, the QS system interferes with the production of bacterial VOCs. The metabolic investment of the bacteria in providing such benefits to plants is in expectation of obtaining mutual advantage for space and other resources. Recent studies demonstrate that bacterial interaction can contribute to the characteristic volatile composition of plant essential oils, which were previously thought to be solely of plant origin. Bacterial interaction can also manipulate emission of plant stress volatiles. Increasing evidence shows the multiple potentials of volatile signalling in plant–bacteria interactions. Recent research efforts aim to investigate a ‘Volatile Conversation’ in plant–bacterium interactions, in which dynamic and responsive exchanges of volatiles occur. The present chapter aims to address the important roles of plant and bacterial volatiles during interaction, and also discusses the future directions to better utilize and understand these valuable flying signals.},

	abstract = {After herbivore attack, many plants emit herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). HIPVs can attract carnivores and/or repel herbivores, thereby mediating tritrophic plant–herbivore–carnivore interactions. HIPVs act as chemical information between organisms; hence, their variability and stability are vital. In the present study, variations in the volatile emissions, from the tea plant Camellia sinensis (O. Ktze) damaged by the tea weevil Myllocerinus aurolineatus (Voss) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), with weevil densities, photoperiod and infestation duration, were investigated. The volatiles induced by high-density weevils were more abundant in composition and amount than those induced by low-density weevils, whether at noon, night or after weevil removal. The induced volatile emissions were similar on the second and third day after infestation, and the emissions of the major induced compounds displayed diurnal cycles. Linalool, (E,E)-α-farnesene, and benzyl nitrile were emitted mainly at noon, whereas 1,3,8-p-menthatriene and (E)-β-ocimene were maximally emitted at night. Given the different emission dynamics, significant differences were found between noon- and night-induced volatiles. In summary, tea plants damaged by different weevil densities emitted a relatively stable signal at a particular time. This stability could be attributed to the similarities under the two densities of the main induced volatile compounds, their relative ratios and the emission dynamics of the induced volatiles.},

	abstract = {Plants produce a variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Under abiotic and biotic stresses, the number and amount of produced compounds can increase. Due to their long life span and large size, trees can produce biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) in much higher amounts than many other plants. It has been suggested that at cellular and tree physiological levels, induced production of VOCs is aimed at improving plant resistance to damage by reactive oxygen species generated by multiple abiotic stresses. In the few reported cases when biosynthesis of plant volatiles is inhibited or enhanced, the observed response to stress can be attributed to plant volatiles. Reported increase, e.g., in photosynthesis has mostly ranged between 5 and 50\%. A comprehensive model to explain similar induction of VOCs under multiple biotic stresses is not yet available. As a result of pathogen or herbivore attack on forest trees, the induced production of VOCs is localized to the damage site but systemic induction of emissions has also been detected. These volatiles can affect fungal pathogens and the arrival rate of herbivorous insects on damaged trees, but also act as signalling compounds to maintain the trophic cascades that may improve tree fitness by improved efficiency of herbivore natural enemies. On the forest scale, biotic induction of VOC synthesis and release leads to an amplified flow of BVOCs in atmospheric reactions, which in atmospheres rich in oxides of nitrogen (NOx) results in ozone formation, and in low NOx atmospheres results in oxidation of VOCs, removal in ozone from the troposphere and the resulting formation of biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles. I will summarize recent advances in the understanding of stress-induced VOC emissions from trees, with special focus on Populus spp. Particular importance is given to the ecological and atmospheric feedback systems based on BVOCs and biogenic SOA formation.},

	abstract = {Eggs deposited on plants by herbivorous insects represent a threat as they develop into feeding larvae. Plants are not a passive substrate and have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to detect eggs and induce direct and indirect defenses. Recent years have seen exciting development in molecular aspects of egg-induced responses. Some egg-associated elicitors have been identified, and signaling pathways and egg-induced expression profiles are being uncovered. Depending on the mode of oviposition, both the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid 	pathways seem to play a role in the induction of defense responses. An emerging concept is that eggs are recognized like microbial pathogens and innate immune responses are triggered. In addition, some eggs contain elicitors that induce highly specific defenses in plants. Examples of egg-induced suppression of defense or, on the contrary, egg-induced resistance highlight the complexity of plant–egg interactions in an on-going arms race between herbivores and their hosts. A major challenge is to identify plant receptors for egg-associated elicitors, to assess the specificity of these elicitors and to identify molecular components that underlie various responses to oviposition.},

However, the effects of both genetic relatedness and presence of herbivores on fitness-related responses of neighboring plants have not yet been explored. Our aim was to examine how manipulating these two important factors genetic and environmental factors can influence indirect plant-plant communication in the annual crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana. Plants of a single genotype (receivers) were exposed to volatile emissions of neighboring emitter plants with a similar or different genotype, and either intact or damaged by larvae of a specialist herbivore for ten days. Each of the four treatments was isolated in separate environmental chambers and the full experiment was replicated twice. Receiver plant growth and reproductive-related traits were measured ten days after exposure to treatments, and at senescence. Results showed that the effect of herbivory and plant genotype of emitter plants influenced responses related growth and reproduction in receiver plants. Receiver plants grew taller, had more inflorescence branching, and produced more fruits (60\% more) when exposed to undamaged emitters of a different genotype than receivers exposed to the other emitter plant treatments. Therefore, genotype identity and environmental context (presence of herbivory) may be important factors influencing indirect plant-plant communication, which could, in turn, result in selection for genotypes showing increased fitness-related responses.},

Early studies were not replicated, and influential reviews questioned the validity of the phenomenon. We collected 48 well-replicated studies and found overall support for the hypothesis that resistance increased for individuals with damaged neighbours. Laboratory or greenhouse studies and those conducted on agricultural crops showed stronger induced resistance than field studies on undomesticated species, presumably because other variation had been reduced. A cumulative analysis revealed that early, non-replicated studies were more variable and showed less evidence for communication. Effects of habitat and plant growth form were undetectable. In most cases, the mechanisms of resistance and alternative hypotheses were not considered. There was no indication that some response variables were more likely to produce large effects. These results indicate that plants of diverse taxonomic affinities and ecological conditions become more resistant to herbivores when exposed to volatiles from damaged neighbours.},

We address the questions of how egg-associated cues elicit plant defenses, how the information that eggs have been laid is transmitted within a plant, and which molecular and chemical plant responses are induced by egg deposition. Finally, we highlight evolutionary aspects of the interactions between plants and insect eggs and ask how the herbivorous insect copes with egg-induced plant defenses and may avoid them by counteradaptations.},

Here, we review both effects of plants on insect eggs and, vice versa, effects of eggs on plants. We consider the influence of plants on the production of insect eggs and address the role of phytochemicals for the biosynthesis and release of insect sex pheromones, as well as for insect fecundity. Effects of plants on insect oviposition by contact and olfactory plant cues are summarised. In addition, we consider how the leaf boundary layer influences both insect egg deposition behaviour and development of the embryo inside the egg. The effects of eggs on plants involve egg-induced changes of photosynthetic activity and of the plant’s secondary metabolism. Except for gall-inducing insects, egg-induced changes of phytochemistry were so far found to be detrimental to the eggs. Egg deposition can induce hypersensitive-like plant response, formation of neoplasms or production of ovicidal plant substances; these plant responses directly harm the eggs. In addition, egg deposition can induce a change of the plant’s odour and leaf surface chemistry which serve indirect plant defence with the help of antagonists of the insect eggs. These egg-induced changes lead to attraction of egg parasitoids and their arrestance on a leaf, respectively. Finally, we summarise knowledge of the elicitors of egg-induced plant changes and address egg-induced effects on the plant’s transcriptional pattern.},

New theories are being proposed to account for the wide diversity of such interactions, particularly where production of plant secondary metabolites is inducible. This chapter briefly describes the more widely known mechanisms by which secondary metabolites act, such as direct toxicity, antifeedancy and sequestration. Key areas covered in greater depth involve the volatile secondary metabolites produced by plants, both inherently and in response to the stress of insect feeding and colonization. Interactions described include the location of host plants by insects and the corresponding avoidance of unsuitable host plants. The roles of volatile plant compounds in the attraction of predators and parasitoids to plants already hosting insect populations, and in the synergism of insect pheromone activity, are discussed.},

	abstract = {In nature, plants are often exposed to multiple stress factors at the same time. The effects of single biotic or abiotic stresses on plant metabolism are well documented but how plants respond to a combination of these is little researched. Here we studied the effects of high salinity and herbivory on levels of secondary compounds and gene expression associated with defences against insects. Hydroponically grown maize plants were subjected to sodium chloride (1, 50, 100mM NaCl) and/or damage by caterpillars of Spodoptera exigua. Salt-stressed plants showed stunted growth, reduced chlorophyll fluorescence and enhanced levels of reactive oxygen species and 1,4-benzoxazin-3-one aglycones (aBX). Herbivory induced higher transcript levels of the Zm-Bx1 gene involved in aBX biosynthesis and of the Zm-SerPIN gene coding for a serine proteinase inhibitor which might affect plant feeding insects. Herbivory also triggered the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are attractive signals for parasitoids and predators and thus regarded as an indirect defence. Herbivore-induced metabolites were differentially affected in salt-stressed plants. High salinity resulted in transient priming of jasmonic acid while aBX levels were reduced in double-stressed plants. Salt stress led to lower herbivore-induced VOC emission per plant but not per unit biomass. However, quantitative shifts in individual compounds were found in both cases. Our study confirms the notion that combined stresses produce a unique phenotype that cannot be derived from single-stress effects. The ecological implications of these changes for organisms from different trophic levels and for plant fitness remain to be tested.},

One of the key questions in understanding patterns of potential coevolutionary links between plant and herbivore is ‘what switches these induced plant defences on?’ Until cues are identified, understanding the evolutionary and ecological significance of defences in the context of the plant is difficult. 2 We induced host plant resistance in a marine macroalga (Ascophyllum nodosum) in the absence of herbivory by application of α-amylase, known to exist in mollusc saliva. There was a demonstrable change in the behaviour of a subsequent herbivore (Littorina obtusata) consistent with herbivore induction, i.e. reduced consumption, more but smaller meals and greater movement. We also produced a concomitant increase in the level of phlorotannins, compounds associated with defence against herbivory. 3 Such changes in herbivore behaviour and plant chemistry provide evidence that brown algae and higher plants utilize similar salivate-based signals in the induction of defence against herbivory. Thus the possibility that such responses could be either highly conserved or a convergent strategy is discussed.},

However, data are lacking on how much of an advantage a parasitoid can gain from following these plant cues and which factors can limit the value of these cues to the parasitoid. In this study, we simulate the Cotesia rubecula–Pieris rapae–Brassica oleracea system, and ask how many more hosts can a parasitoid attack in a single day of foraging by following plant signals versus randomly foraging. We vary herbivore density, plant response time, parasitoid flight distance, and available host stages to see under which conditions parasitoids benefit from herbivore-induced plant cues. In most of the parameter combinations studied, parasitoids that responded to cues attacked more hosts than those that foraged randomly. Parasitoids following plant cues attacked up to ten times more hosts when they were able to successfully attack herbivores older than first instar; however, if parasitoids were limited to first instar hosts, those following plant cues were at a disadvantage when plants took longer than a day to respond to herbivory. At low herbivore densities, only parasitoids with a larger foraging radius could take advantage of plant cues. Although preference for herbivore-induced volatiles was not always beneficial for a parasitoid, under the most likely natural conditions, the model predicts that C. rubecula gains fitness from following plant cues.},

	abstract = {Among of the wide range of potentially interesting astrophysical sources for gravitational wave detectors Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo are galactic core-collapse supernovae. Although detectable core-collapse supernovae have a low expected rate (a few per century, or less) these signals would yield a wealth of new physics. Of particular interest is the insight into the explosion mechanism driving core-collapse supernovae that can be gleaned from the reconstructed gravitational wave signal. A well-reconstructed waveform will allow us to assess the likelihood of different explosion models, perform model selection, and potentially map unexpected features to new physics. This dissertation presents a series of studies evaluating the current performance of burst parameter estimation algorithms in reconstructing core-collapse supernovae gravitational wave signals in both simple Gaussian noise and realistic non-Gaussian detector noise. The introduction of non-Gaussian noise has a significant impact on the recovery of core-collapse supernova models from the data. 
Terrestrial noise is also an important factor in the recovery of any gravitational wave search. This work also details a series of studies that enable the characterization of ground motion local to the Advanced LIGO inteferometers and the ability of the installed active seismic isolation to mitigate it.},

	abstract = {Many parasitoid species use olfactory cues to locate their hosts. In tritrophic systems, parasitoids of herbivores can exploit the chemical blends emitted by plants in reaction to herbivore-induced damage, known as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). In this study, we explored the specificity and innateness of parasitoid responses to HIPVs using a meta-analysis of data from the literature. Based on the concept of dietary specialization and infochemical use, we hypothesized that (i) specialist parasitoids (i.e., with narrow host ranges) should be attracted to specific HIPV signals, whereas generalist parasitoids (i.e., with broad host ranges) should be attracted to more generic HIPV signals and (ii) specialist parasitoids should innately respond to HIPVs, whereas generalist parasitoids should have to learn to associate HIPVs with host presence. We characterized the responses of 66 parasitoid species based on published studies of parasitoid behavior. Our meta-analysis showed that (i) as predicted, specialist parasitoids were attracted to more specific signals than were generalist parasitoids but, (ii) contrary to expectations, response innateness depended on a parasitoid's target host life stage rather than on its degree of host specialization: parasitoids of larvae were more likely to show an innate response to HIPVs than were parasitoids of adults. This result changes our understanding of dietary specialization and highlights the need for further theoretical research that will help clarify infochemical use by parasitoids.},

Little is known about what controls the volatile emission differences between damaged and undamaged tissues and how these affect the orientation of herbivore enemies. We investigated volatile emission from damaged and adjacent undamaged foliage of black poplar (Populus nigra) after herbivory by gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) caterpillars and determined the compounds mediating the attraction of the gypsy moth parasitoid Glyptapanteles liparidis (Braconidae). Female parasitoids were more attracted to gypsy moth-damaged leaves than to adjacent non-damaged leaves. The most characteristic volatiles of damaged versus neighbouring undamaged leaves included terpenes, green leaf volatiles and nitrogen-containing compounds, such as aldoximes and nitriles. Electrophysiological recordings and olfactometer bioassays demonstrated the importance of nitrogenous volatiles. Under field conditions, parasitic Hymenoptera were more attracted to traps baited with these substances than most other compounds. The differences in volatile emission profiles between damaged and undamaged foliage appear to be regulated by jasmonate signalling and the local activation of volatile biosynthesis. We conclude that characteristic volatiles from damaged black poplar foliage are essential cues enabling parasitoids to find their hosts.},

	abstract = {This paper describes research at IACR-Rothamsted on aphid parasitoid responses to semiochemical foraging stimuli, aimed at developing novel ways of manipulating these behaviours to overcome ecological constraints to biological and integrated pest control. Female parasitoids respond both to aphid sex pheromones acting as kairomones, and to aphid-induced plant volatiles, acting as synomones. A range of economically important parasitoid species respond to aphid sex pheromones, and their potential for enhancing parasitization of aphid populations has been demonstrated in the field. Commercial production of the pheromone from the plant Nepeta cataria L has been developed and strategies for its use in arable crops are being investigated. Aphid-induced plant volatiles are released systemically throughout the plant and are aphid species specific, probably induced by elicitors in aphid saliva. Aphid-infested plants can induce uninfested neighbours to release damage-related volatiles, plant-to-plant communication occurring via the rhizosphere. The plant compound cis-jasmone has been identified as a plant signal with potential for aphid control, inducing plant defence mechanisms that both deter colonising aphids and attract parasitoids and predators. Such compounds may represent a new generation of crop protectants and their further investigation and development will be aided by the tools generated by genomic and post-genomic biology. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry},

Opportunities for future work in floral systems include identifying specific microbial semiochemicals that underlie insect behavioral responses and examining if insect species vary in their responses to microbial volatiles.

We tested the effects of several prominent constitutive terpenoids released by conifers and Eucalyptus trees on electrophysiological and behavioral responses of an oligophagous species, Plutella xylostella, which feeds on Brassicaceae. The non-host plant volatile terpenoids adversely affected the calling behavior (pheromone emission) of adult females, and the orientation responses of adult males to sex pheromone were also significantly inhibited by these terpenoids in a wind tunnel and in the field. We suggest that disruption of both pheromone emission and orientation to sex pheromone may explain, at least in part, an observed reduction in herbivore attack in polyculture compared with monoculture plantings. We also propose that mating disruption of both male and female moths with non-host plant volatiles may be a promising alternative pest management strategy.},

	abstract = {Most herbivorous arthropods are specialists that feed on one or a few related plant species. To understand why this is so, both mechanistic and functional studies have been carried out, predominantly restricted to bitrophic aspects. Host-selection behaviour of herbivorous arthropods has been intensively studied and this has provided ample evidence for the role of secondary plant chemicals as source of information in behavioural decisions of herbivores. Many evolutionary studies have regarded co-evolution between plants and herbivores to explain the diversity of secondary plant chemicals and host specialisation of herbivores. However, many cases remain unexplained where herbivores select host plants that are suboptimal in terms of fitness returns. A stimulating paper by Bernays and Graham [(1988) Ecology 69, 886–892)] has initiated a discussion on the need of a multitrophic perspective to understand the evolution of host-plant specialisation by herbivorous arthropods. However, this has hardly resulted in ecological studies on host-selection behaviour that take a multitrophic perspective. Yet, evidence is accumulating that constitutive and induced infochemicals from natural enemies and competitors can affect herbivore behaviour. These cues may constitute important information on fitness prospects, just as plant cues can do. In this paper I selectively review how information from organisms at different trophic levels varies in space and time and how herbivores can integratively exploit this information during host selection. In doing so, research areas are identified that are likely to provide important new insights to explain several of the questions in herbivore host selection that remain unanswered so far. These research areas are at the interface of evolutionary ecology, behavioural ecology and chemical ecology.},

Tropospheric air pollutants, such as ozone, can impair plant–plant interactions, e.g. by degrading volatile signals. In this study, field and laboratory experiments were conducted to assess whether plant–plant interactions between damaged and undamaged cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) plants provide receivers with a competitive advantage by altering their susceptibility to oviposition by the specialist herbivores Pieris brassicae and Plutella xylostella. We tested the phenomenon in oviposition choice tests under ambient and enriched ozone conditions. We also investigated the effect of receiving a signal from a different Brassica oleracea cultivar group, in this study broccoli (Brassica oleracea var italica), on the susceptibility to oviposition of cabbage plants. Cabbage plants exposed to damaged cabbage neighbors under ambient ozone were less susceptible to oviposition by P. brassicae in the field, but not in the laboratory. At ambient ozone levels P. xylostella preferred to oviposit on cabbage plants exposed to undamaged conspecifics in both the field and laboratory. At enriched ozone levels in the field, P. xylostella showed no oviposition preference for cabbage exposed to damaged or undamaged cabbage neighbors. In multiple choice tests in the laboratory, P. xylostella preferred to oviposit on cabbage plants exposed to damaged broccoli plants at ambient ozone over plants exposed to undamaged broccoli plants at ambient ozone and damaged and undamaged broccoli plants at enriched ozone. We conclude that plant–plant interactions and ozone interplay when influencing the susceptibility of plants to oviposition by herbivores.},

	abstract = {The ability of many animals to recognize kin has allowed them to evolve diverse cooperative behaviours; such ability is less well studied for plants. Many plants, including Artemisia tridentata, have been found to respond to volatile cues emitted by experimentally wounded neighbours to increase levels of resistance to herbivory. We report that this communication was more effective among A. tridentata plants that were more closely related based on microsatellite markers. Plants in the field that received cues from experimentally clipped close relatives experienced less leaf herbivory over the growing season than those that received cues from clipped neighbours that were more distantly related. These results indicate that plants can respond differently to cues from kin, making it less likely that emitters will aid strangers and making it more likely that receivers will respond to cues from relatives. More effective defence adds to a growing list of favourable consequences of kin recognition for plants.},

	abstract = {Early colonization by Zyginidia scutellaris leafhoppers might be a key factor in the attraction and settling of generalist predators, such as Orius spp., in maize fields. In this paper, we aimed to determine whether our observations of early season increases in field populations of Orius spp. reflect a specific attraction to Z. scutellaris-induced maize volatiles, and how the responses of Orius predators to herbivore-induced volatiles (HIPVs) might be affected by previous experiences on plants infested by herbivorous prey. Therefore, we examined the innate and learned preferences of Orius majusculus toward volatiles from maize plants attacked by three potential herbivores with different feeding strategies: the leafhopper Z. scutellaris (mesophyll feeder), the lepidopteran Spodoptera littoralis (chewer), and another leafhopper Dalbulus maidis (phloem feeder). In addition, we examined the volatile profiles emitted by maize plants infested by the three herbivores. Our results show that predators exhibit a strong innate attraction to volatiles from maize plants infested with Z. scutellaris or S. littoralis. Previous predation experience in the presence of HIPVs influences the predator’s odor preferences. The innate preference for plants with cell or tissue damage may be explained by these plants releasing far more volatiles than plants infested by the phloem-sucking D. maidis. However, a predation experience on D. maidis-infested plants increased the preference for D. maidis-induced maize volatiles. After O. majusculus experienced L3-L4 larvae (too large to serve as prey) on S. littoralis-infested plants, they showed reduced attraction toward these plants and an increased attraction toward D. maidis-infested plants. When offered young larvae of S. littoralis, which are more suitable prey, preference toward HIPVs was similar to that of naive individuals. The HIPVs from plants infested by herbivores with distinctly different feeding strategies showed distinguishable quantitative differences in (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, and methyl salicylate. These compounds might serve as reliable indicators of prey presence and identity for the predator. Our results support the idea that feeding by Z. scutellaris results in the emission of maize’s HIPVs that initially recruit Orius spp. into maize fields.},

There is also mounting evidence that plant VOCs provide direct defense against various abiotic and biotic stresses. The ability of plant volatile compounds to act as reliable attraction and deterrence cue for herbivores and pathogens and attraction cue for beneficial insects presents new prospects for its commercial use as baits in sustainable agriculture. Considerable progress has been made in utilizing the VOC-mediated signaling in pest control, plant defense priming, and growth stimulation. At present, the use of genetically modified (GM) crops with altered VOC emission and synthetic plant VOCs in field setting has shown promising results. In this chapter, we review the different areas in which the possible benefits of plant VOCs can be utilized. We also discuss the potential use of GM crops and commercial VOC formulations in agriculture for their defensive role against abiotic and biotic stresses.},

We manipulated jasmonate-induced plant resistance, exposure to the natural predator community and herbivore density to test how these factors jointly and independently affect herbivore population growth. On low-resistance plants, the predator community was diverse and abundant, promoting high predator consumption rates. On high-resistance plants, the predator community was less diverse and abundant, resulting in low predator consumption rate. Plant resistance only directly regulated aphid population growth on predator-excluded plants. When predators were present, plant resistance indirectly regulated herbivore population growth by changing the impact of predators on the herbivorous prey. A possible mechanism for the interaction between plant resistance and predation is that methyl salicylate, a herbivore-induced plant volatile attractive to predators, was more strongly induced in low-resistance plants. Increased plant resistance reduced predator attractant lures, preventing predators from locating their prey. Low-resistance plants may regulate herbivore populations via predators by providing reliable information on prey availability and increasing the effectiveness of predators.},

Plants can gather information about potential future herbivory by detecting volatiles that are emitted by herbivore-attacked neighbors. Several individual volatiles have been identified as active danger cues. Recent work has also shown that plants may integrate multiple volatiles into their defense responses. Here, I discuss how the integration of multiple volatiles can increase the capacity of plants to predict future herbivore attack. I propose that integration of multiple volatile cues does not occur at the perception stage, but may through downstream early defense signaling and then be further consolidated by hormonal crosstalk. Exploring plant volatile cue integration can facilitate our understanding and utilization of chemical information transfer.},

Insects respond to plant chemicals in a variety of interesting ways which has tremendous potential in pest management programmes. In a normal state, plants release a spectrum of species-specific VOCs through their leaf, stem, flower, and even root surfaces, and they become host location cues to insects leading to their colonisation on the plant, whereas the plants damaged by insect feeding emit qualitatively and quantitatively different volatiles that become host/prey location signals to the wandering insect natural enemies causing the reduction of the pest population. In addition to this, plant volatiles synergise or deter the insect sex pheromonal activities. Insects possess excellent chemosensory system for detection of volatile chemicals. The advent of electrophysiology, scanning, and transmission electron microscopic techniques made insect sensory physiology/morphology an admirable tool to unravel the mechanisms underlying the insect responses to plant volatile compounds.},

Floral VOCs are often involved in defense and pollinator attraction. These interactions often change rapidly over time, so a quick response to those changes is required. Epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, which regulate both genes and transcription factors, might trigger adaptive responses to these evolutionary pressures as well as regulating the rhythmic emission of VOCs through circadian clock regulation. In addition, transgenerational epigenetic effects and whole genome polyploidy could modify the generation of VOCs’ profiles of offspring, contributing to long-term evolutionary shifts.

Chemical ecology is the discipline that not only attends to decipher the chemical language by identifying the compounds, but also tries to understand their ecological role in communication, defense, and finding food and mating partners. This article focuses on chemical communication, which may be broadly defined as the information transfer from the sender of a signal to a receiver via the chemical channel. This exchange of information can be deliberate or unintended, and can occur both within and between species. The information may either benefit sender or receiver only, or be useful for both parties. Given the rapid progress chemical ecology has made in recent years due to the advancement of analytical instrumentation, this article cannot cover the entire subject in detail. Instead it provides a general introduction into the relevant terminology, the underlying evolutionary and ecological concepts, and chemical structures. Since only a few examples can be mentioned, the reader is strongly encouraged to engage more intensively in this multifaceted and highly fascinating branch of ecological research.},

	abstract = {Lima bean plants respond to feeding damage of two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) with the emission of a complex blend of volatiles that are products of several different biosynthetic pathways. These volatiles attract the carnivorous mite Phytoseiulus persimilis, a specialist predator of the spider mites that exterminates entire prey populations, and thus the volatiles contribute indirectly to plant defense. The volatile blend constitutes information to the carnivores, and blend composition is an important factor in this. Jasmonic acid (JA) is involved in the signal transduction of this induced defense. Application of JA through the petiole of Lima bean plants induces a volatile blend that is similar, but not identical, to that emitted by spider mite-infested plants. The induced volatiles originate from the lipoxygenase pathway, the shikimic acid pathway, and the isoprenoid pathway. Among the induced bean plant volatiles are nitriles and oximes. Of a total of 61 components, 10 are emitted at significantly different rates. Among these are the terpene (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene and the phenolic methyl salicylate, two compounds that are known to attract P. persimilis. A crucial test for comparing the effect of spider mite damage and JA application on volatile induction is the response of P. persimilis. The carnivore is attracted by volatiles from JA-treated plants. Moreover, even treatment of Lima bean plants with methyl jasmonate vapor made the plants attractive to the carnivorous mites. However, the predators prefer the volatiles from spider-mite-infested Lima bean plants over those from JA-treated plants. Thus, chemical as well as behavioral analyses demonstrate that spider mite damage and JA treatment have similar, although not identical, effects on volatile induction in Lima bean plants.},

In this review, we first summarize how soil parameters and climate variables influence Si assimilation in plants. Then, we describe recent evidences on the ability of Si to modulate plant volatile emissions, with potential cascade effects on phytophagous insects and higher trophic levels. Even though the mechanisms still need to be elucidated, Si accumulation in plants leads to contrasting effects on the levels of the three major phytohormones, namely jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and ethylene, resulting in modified emissions of plant volatile organic compounds. Herbivore-induced plant volatiles would be particularly impacted by Si concentration in plant tissues, resulting in a cascade effect on the attraction of natural enemies of pests, known to locate their prey or hosts based on plant volatile cues. Since seven of the top 10 most important crops in the world are Si-accumulating Poaceae species, it is important to discuss the potential of Si mobility in soil-plant systems as a novel component of an integrated pest management.},

The caterpillar-induced plant volatiles have been reported to repel or attract conspecific adult herbivores. To date however, no volatile signals that either repel or attract conspecific adults under field conditions have been chemically identified. Apple seedlings uniquely released seven compounds including acetic acid, acetic anhydride, benzyl alcohol, benzyl nitrile, indole, 2-phenylethanol, and (E)-nerolidol only when infested by larvae of the light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana. In field tests in New Zealand, a blend of two of these, benzyl nitrile and acetic acid, attracted a large number of conspecific male and female adult moths. In North America, male and female adults of the tortricid, oblique-banded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana, were most attracted to a blend of 2-phenylethanol and acetic acid. Both sexes of the eye-spotted bud moth, Spilonota ocellana, were highly attracted to a blend of benzyl nitrile and acetic acid. This study provides the first identification of caterpillar-induced plant volatiles that attract conspecific adult herbivores under natural conditions, challenging the expectation of herbivore avoidance of these induced volatiles.},

However, the effects of rhizobia on plant volatiles, which serve as indirect and direct defenses against arthropod herbivores and as signals in defense-associated plant–plant and within-plant signaling, are still unstudied. We measured the release of jasmonic acid (JA)-induced volatiles of rhizobia-colonized and rhizobia-free lima bean plants (Fabaceae: Phaseolus lunatus L.) and tested effects of their respective bouquets of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on a specialist insect herbivore (Mexican bean beetle; Coccinellidae: Epilachna varivestis Mulsant) in olfactometer choice trials. In a further experiment, we showed that VOC induction by JA reflects the plant responses to mechanical wounding and insect herbivory. Following induction with JA, rhizobia-colonized plants released significantly higher amounts of the shikimic acid-derived compounds, whereas the emission of compounds produced via the octadecanoid, mevalonate and non-mevalonate pathways was reduced. These changes affected the choice behavior of beetles as the preference of non-induced plants was much more pronounced for plants that were colonized by rhizobia. We showed that indole likely represents the causing agent for the observed repellent effects of jasmonic acid-induced VOCs of rhizobia-colonized lima bean plants. Our study demonstrates a rhizobia-triggered efficacy of induced plant defense via volatiles. Due to these findings, we interpret rhizobia as an integral part of legume defenses against herbivores.},

We examined 15 populations of sagebrush that experience a range of naturally occurring herbivory along a 300 km latitudinal transect. As predicted by the KSH, we found several uncommon chemotypes with some chemotypes occurring only within a single population. Consistent with the MBH, chemotypic diversity was negatively correlated with herbivore pressure; sites with higher levels of herbivory were associated with a few common cues broadly recognized by most individuals. These cues varied among different populations. Our results are similar to those reported for anti-predator signalling in vertebrates.},

	abstract = {Fatty acid derivatives are of central importance for plant immunity against insect herbivores; however, major regulatory genes and the signals that modulate these defense metabolites are vastly understudied, especially in important agro-economic monocot species. Here we show that products and signals derived from a single Zea mays (maize) lipoxygenase (LOX), ZmLOX10, are critical for both direct and indirect defenses to herbivory. We provide genetic evidence that two 13-LOXs, ZmLOX10 and ZmLOX8, specialize in providing substrate for the green leaf volatile (GLV) and jasmonate (JA) biosynthesis pathways, respectively. Supporting the specialization of these LOX isoforms, LOX8 and LOX10 are localized to two distinct cellular compartments, indicating that the JA and GLV biosynthesis pathways are physically separated in maize. Reduced expression of JA biosynthesis genes and diminished levels of JA in lox10 mutants indicate that LOX10-derived signaling is required for LOX8-mediated JA. The possible role of GLVs in JA signaling is supported by their ability to partially restore wound-induced JA levels in lox10 mutants. The impaired ability of lox10 mutants to produce GLVs and JA led to dramatic reductions in herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) and attractiveness to parasitoid wasps. Because LOX10 is under circadian rhythm regulation, this study provides a mechanistic link to the diurnal regulation of GLVs and HIPVs. GLV-, JA- and HIPV-deficient lox10 mutants display compromised resistance to insect feeding, both under laboratory and field conditions, which is strong evidence that LOX10-dependent metabolites confer immunity against insect attack. Hence, this comprehensive gene to agro-ecosystem study reveals the broad implications of a single LOX isoform in herbivore defense.},

	volume = {95},
	abstract = {Plants react to herbivore attack by activating elaborate defence mechanisms. The success of plants in withstanding herbivory depends on their ability to quickly recognize, decipher the incoming signal, and adequately respond to a wide array of attacking insects. In contrast to the somatic adaptive immune system of mammals involving mobile defender cells, plant immune responses rely on the ability of each cell to recognize and respond to herbivore attack and on systemic signals originating from infected or wounded sites. Plant Ca2+ signals are involved in a sizable array of intracellular signaling pathways after pest invasion. A Ca2+ signal is defined by the balanced activation of Ca2+ channels at different cellular membranes, which is followed by the subsequent inactivation of channels and activation of efflux transporters to terminate Ca2+ influx and to rebalance cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Upon herbivore feeding, there is a dramatic Ca2+ influx, followed by the activation of Ca2+-dependent signal transduction pathways that include interacting downstream networks of kinases for defense responses. Like in animal cells, free intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) variations in plant cells are key signals in many cellular regulatory functions, playing a major role in mediating various endogenous and exogenous signals. Ca2+-binding sensory proteins such as Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) have been recently documented to mediate the signaling following Ca2+ influx after herbivory, in phytohormone-independent manner. Here we review the sequence of signal transductions triggered by herbivory-invoked Ca2+ signaling leading to plant volatile emission by analyzing the connection between early events and the production of herbivore-induced volatile compounds.},

Only plants with spider mite-infestation emitted the monoterpene (E)-β-ocimene. Predatory mites were equally attracted to ozone-exposed and unexposed plants, but discriminated between spider mite-infested and uninfested plants, when both were exposed to ozone. The similarities between ozone and herbivore-induced VOCs suggest that plant defence against phytotoxic ozone and the production of VOCs for attraction of the natural enemies of herbivores may have adaptive coevolution. However, the expected elevated ozone concentrations in future may not disturb tritrophic signalling, unless herbivore-induced VOCs are lost in the process of aerosol formation.},

Compared to undamaged control plants, infestation with SWF did not induce volatile emissions or affect the number and density of pigment glands that store volatile and nonvolatile terpenoid compounds, whereas infestation by BAW strongly induced plant volatile emission. When challenged by the two insect herbivores simultaneously, volatile emission was significantly less than for plants infested with only BAW. Our results suggest that tritrophic level interactions between cotton, BAW, and natural enemies of BAW, that are known to be mediated by plant volatile emissions, may be perturbed by simultaneous infestation by SWF. Possible mechanisms by which the presence of whiteflies may attenuate volatile emissions from caterpillar-damaged cotton plants are discussed.},

	abstract = {Plant cells are bounded by a dense cell envelope that prevents the penetration of viruses. Wounding of the cell wall (CW) through microdamage caused by abiotic factors (wind, hail, rain) and biotic factors (insects) may allow the penetration of virus particles into the cell. Once in the cytoplasm, the viral genome is translated, replicated, and later transferred to neighboring cells and throughout the plant. On the other hand, mechanical damage to the leaf promotes the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as green leaf volatiles and methanol (MeOH), which are quickly taken up by the intact leaves of the damaged plant and the neighboring plants. The transport of VOCs is much faster compared to the transport of infectious viral entities through the phloem during systemic infection of a plant. Thus, exposure to VOCs may result in a ‘priming’ effect on intact leaves, setting the stage for the subsequent viral infection. In tobacco leaves, MeOH induces the synthesis of mRNA encoding the so-called methanol-inducible genes, most of which are associated with stress, defense, and the intercellular transport of macromolecules. The emission of MeOH by a wounded plant enhances the resistance of non-wounded neighboring ‘receiver’ plants to the bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum and promotes cell-to-cell communication that facilitates the spread of Tobacco mosaic virus in neighboring plants. For the vector-transmitted viruses, such as persistent viruses (Potato leafroll virus and Barley yellow dwarf virus) and non persistent viruses (Cucumber mosaic virus), VOCs also play a favorable auxiliary role, whereas VOCs are alarm cues that promote protective mechanisms in response to other pathogens (bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, nematodes) and herbivore attack. The different effects of VOCs on plant viruses and other pathogens seem to be due to differences in the localization of the pathogen. While a virus spends its entire life cycle in the cell symplast, bacteria and other pathogens reside in the apoplast. VOCs are apoplastic factors that are transferred through the air and affect the structure of the apoplast, including the CW, which is essential for plant immunity. Our knowledge of the role of VOCs in the viral life cycle and in inter- and intra-plant communication remains incomplete. When considering the use of VOCs for plant protection, we must keep in mind the potential sensitization of plants to viral infections, which is most likely the inevitable price of resistance to bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, and nematodes.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, biological control programs for greenhouse tomatoes and other crops have been successfully implemented using zoophytophagous plant bugs (Miridae), which can feed on both plant tissues and insect prey. It is well known that plants respond to herbivore attacks by releasing volatile compounds through diverse pathways triggered by phytohormones. These herbivore-induced plant volatiles can alert neighboring plants, repel or attract herbivores, and attract natural enemies of these herbivores. Nevertheless, the possible benefits of induced plant responses by zoophytophagous predators that could add to their usefulness as biocontrol agents have not been studied until now. Here we show that the zoophytophagous predator Nesidiocoris tenuis activated abscisic acid and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways in tomato plants, which made them less attractive to the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, a major tomato pest worldwide, and more attractive to the whitefly parasitoid, Encarsia formosa. We also found that intact tomato plants exposed to volatiles from N. tenuis-punctured plants activated the JA pathway, and as a consequence, E. formosa was also attracted to these intact plants with activated defense systems. Thus, our results demonstrate that N. tenuis not only benefits tomato plants directly by entomophagy but also indirectly by phytophagy, which induces a physiological response in the tomato plant.},

Compounding these problems, insect pests often vector pathogenic or toxigenic microbes to plants. Previous work has considered plant–insect and plant–microbe interactions separately. Although insects are well-understood to use plant volatiles to locate hosts, microorganisms can produce distinct and abundant volatile compounds that in some cases strongly attract insects. In this paper, we focus on the microbial contribution to plant volatile blends, highlighting the compounds emitted and the potential for variation in microbial emission. We suggest that these aspects of microbial volatile emission may make these compounds ideal for use in agricultural applications, as they may be more specific or enhance methods currently used in insect control or monitoring. Our survey of microbial volatiles in insect–plant interactions suggests that these emissions not only signal host suitability but may indicate a distinctive time frame for optimal conditions for both insect and microbe. Exploitation of these host-specific microbe semiochemicals may provide important microbe- and host-based attractants and a basis for future plant–insect–microbe chemical ecology investigations.},

Here it is demonstrated that several independent 35S::PS lines emit high levels of specific volatiles in addition to increased accumulation of proteinase inhibitors (PIs). Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of systemically induced volatile compounds including green-leaf volatiles, terpenes, and shikimic acid-derivatives from 35S::PS and def1 plants in response to herbivore wounding and treatment with jasmonic acid (JA) are described. Application of JA induced defense protein accumulation and volatile emissions in wild type plants, but did not further increase systemic volatile emissions from 35S::PS plants. Wounding by Manduca sexta larvae induced synthesis of defense proteins and emission of volatiles in wild type plants, but not in def1 plants. Application of jasmonic acid restored the local and systemic accumulation of defense proteins in def1, as well as enhanced herbivore-induced volatile emissions. These results provide strong support for the role of prosystemin- and JA-signaling in the regulation of volatile emissions in tomato plants.},

Host-related volatile signals can be plant-based, originate from the herbivore host or produced from an interaction between herbivores and their plant host. In order to investigate potential sex- and species-related differences in the antennal response of parasitoids to different host-related volatiles, we compared the electroantennogram (EAG) responses of both sexes of the specialist parasitoid, Microplitis croceipes (Cresson), and the generalist, Cotesia marginiventris (Cresson), to varying doses of selected plant-based host-related volatiles: two green leaf volatiles (cis-3-hexenol and hexanal) and three inducible compounds (cis-3-hexenyl acetate, linalool, and (E,E)-α-farnesene). Mating had no significant effect on EAG response. Females of both species showed significantly greater EAG responses than conspecific males to green leaf volatiles, which are released immediately after initiation of herbivore feeding damage. In contrast, males showed greater responses than conspecific females to inducible compounds released much later after initial damage. Cotesia marginiventris females and males showed greater EAG responses than counterpart M. croceipes to the tested compounds at various doses, suggesting that the generalist parasitoid shows greater antennal sensitivity than the specialist to the tested host-plant volatiles. These results are discussed in relation to the possible roles of green leaf volatiles and inducible compounds in the ecology of female and male parasitoids.},

For biting–chewing herbivores the octadecanoid signal-transduction pathway has been suggested to play a key role in induced plant defence. To test this hypothesis in our plant—herbivore—parasitoid tritrophic system, we used phenidone, an inhibitor of the enzyme lipoxygenase (LOX), that catalyses the initial step in the octadecanoid pathway. Phenidone treatment of Brussels sprouts plants reduced the accumulation of internal signalling compounds in the octadecanoid pathway downstream of the step catalysed by LOX, i.e. 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and jasmonic acid. The attraction of Cotesia glomerata parasitoids to host-infested plants was significantly reduced by phenidone treatment. The three herbivores investigated, i.e. the specialists Plutella xylostella, Pieris brassicae and Pieris rapae, showed different oviposition preferences for intact and infested plants, and for two species their preference for either intact or infested plants was shown to be LOX dependent. Our results show that phenidone inhibits the LOX-dependent defence response of the plant and that this inhibition can influence the behaviour of members of the associated insect community.},

	abstract = {Volatile plant secondary metabolites are detected by the highly sensitive olfactory system employed by insects to locate suitable plants as hosts and to avoid unsuitable hosts. Perception of these compounds depends on olfactory receptor neurones (ORNs) in sensillae, mostly on the insect antennae, which can recognise individual molecular structures. Perception of blends of plant volatiles plays a pivotal role in host recognition, non-host avoidance and ensuing behavioural responses as different responses can occur to a whole blend compared to individual components. There are emergent properties of blend perception because components of the host blend may not be recognised as host when perceived outside the context of that blend. Often there is redundancy in the composition of blends recognised as host because certain compounds can be substituted by others. Fine spatio-temporal resolution of the synchronous firing of ORNs tuned to specific compounds enables insects to pick out relevant host odour cues against high background noise and with ephemeral exposure to the volatiles at varying concentrations. This task is challenging as they usually rely on ubiquitous plant volatiles and not those taxonomically characteristic of host plants. However, such an odour coding system has the advantage of providing flexibility; it allows for adaptation to changing environments by alterations in signal processing while maintaining the same peripheral olfactory receptors.},

HIPV can be perceived by parasitoids and predators which parasitize or prey on the respective herbivores, including parasitic hymenoptera. HIPV act as signals and facilitate host/prey detection. They comprise a blend of compounds: main constituents are terpenoids and “green leaf volatiles.” Constitutive emission of PV is well known to be influenced by abiotic factors like temperature, light intensity, water, and nutrient availability. HIPV share biosynthetic pathways with constitutively emitted PV and might therefore likewise be affected by abiotic conditions. However, the effects of abiotic factors on HIPV-mediated biotic interactions have received only limited attention to date. HIPV being influenced by the plant’s growing conditions could have major implications for pest management. Quantitative and qualitative changes in HIPV blends may improve or impair biocontrol. Enhanced emission of HIPV may attract a larger number of natural enemies. Reduced emission rates or altered compositions, however, may render blends imperceptible to parasitoides and predators. Predicting the outcome of these changes is highly important for food production and for ecosystems affected by global climate change.},

Any type of surface damage commonly causes plant leaves to release so-called green leaf volatiles, whereas blends of inducible compounds are more specific for herbivore attack and can vary considerably among plant genotypes. We compared the responses of naïve and experienced parasitoids of the species Cotesia marginiventris and Microplitis rufiventris to volatiles from maize leaves with fresh damage (mainly green leaf volatiles) vs. old damage (mainly terpenoids) in a six-arm olfactometer. These braconid wasps are both solitary endoparasitoids of lepidopteran larvae, but differ in geographical origin and host range. In choice experiments with odor blends from maize plants with fresh damage vs. blends from plants with old damage, inexperienced C. marginiventris showed a preference for the volatiles from freshly damaged leaves. No such preference was observed for inexperienced M. rufiventris. After an oviposition experience in hosts feeding on maize plants, C. marginiventris females were more attracted by a mixture of volatiles from fresh and old damage. Apparently, C. marginiventris has an innate preference for the odor of freshly damaged leaves, and this preference shifts in favor of a blend containing a mixture of green leaf volatiles plus terpenoids, after experiencing the latter blend in association with hosts. M. rufiventris responded poorly after experience and preferred fresh damage odors. Possibly, after associative learning, this species uses cues that are more directly related with the host presence, such as volatiles from host feces, which were not present in the odor sources offered in the olfactometer. The results demonstrate the complexity of the use of plant volatiles by parasitoids and show that different parasitoid species have evolved different strategies to exploit these signals.},

	abstract = {Herbivore feeding activates plant defenses at the site of damage as well as systemically. Systemic defenses can be induced internally by signals transported via phloem or xylem, or externally transmitted by volatiles emitted from the damaged tissues. We investigated the role of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) in activating a defense response between branches in blueberry plants. Blueberries are perennial shrubs that grow by initiating adventitious shoots from a basal crown, which produce new lateral branches. This type of growth constrains vascular connections between shoots and branches within plants. While we found that leaves within a branch were highly connected, vascular connectivity was limited between branches within shoots and absent between branches from different shoots. Larval feeding by gypsy moth, exogenous methyl jasmonate, and mechanical damage differentially induced volatile emissions in blueberry plants, and there was a positive correlation between amount of insect damage and volatile emission rates. Herbivore damage did not affect systemic defense induction when we isolated systemic branches from external exposure to HIPVs. Thus, internal signals were not capable of triggering systemic defenses among branches. However, exposure of branches to HIPVs from an adjacent branch decreased larval consumption by 70\% compared to those exposed to volatiles from undamaged branches. This reduction in leaf consumption did not result in decreased volatile emissions, indicating that leaves became more responsive to herbivory (or “primed”) after being exposed to HIPVs. Chemical profiles of leaves damaged by gypsy moth caterpillars, exposed to HIPVs, or non-damaged controls revealed that HIPV-exposed leaves had greater chemical similarities to damaged leaves than to control leaves. Insect-damaged leaves and young HIPV-exposed leaves had higher amounts of endogenous cis-jasmonic acid compared to undamaged and non-exposed leaves, respectively. Our results show that exposure to HIPVs triggered systemic induction of direct defenses against gypsy moth and primed volatile emissions, which can be an indirect defense. Blueberry plants appear to rely on HIPVs as external signals for inter-branch communication.},

Furthermore, we observed stronger induction of the defense phytohormone jasmonic acid in exposed plants compared to controls. These findings document a novel class of plant-insect interactions mediated by the direct perception, by plants, of insect-derived olfactory cues.

However, the key volatiles that trigger this primed state remain largely unidentified. In maize, the release of the aromatic compound indole is herbivore-specific and occurs earlier than other induced responses. We therefore hypothesized that indole may be involved in airborne priming. Using indole-deficient mutants and synthetic indole dispensers, we show that herbivore-induced indole enhances the induction of defensive volatiles in neighbouring maize plants in a species-specific manner. Furthermore, the release of indole is essential for priming of mono- and homoterpenes in systemic leaves of attacked plants. Indole exposure markedly increases the herbivore-induced production of the stress hormones jasmonate-isoleucine conjugate and abscisic acid, which represents a likely mechanism for indole-dependent priming. These results demonstrate that indole functions as a rapid and potent aerial priming agent that prepares systemic tissues and neighbouring plants for incoming attacks.},

	abstract = {Plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) elicited in response to herbivory serve as cues for parasitic and predatory insects. Knowledge about quantitative relationships between the extent of herbivore-induced damage and the quantities of VOCs released is scarce. We studied the kinetics of VOC-emissions from foliage of the deciduous tree Alnus glutinosa induced by feeding activity of larvae of the geometrid moth Cabera pusaria. Quantitative relationships between the intensity of stress and strength of plant response were determined. Intensity of biotic stress was characterized by herbivore numbers (0–8 larvae) and by the amount of leaf area eaten. The strength of plant response was characterized by monitoring (i) changes in photosynthesis, (ii) leaf ultrastructure, and (iii) plant volatiles. Net assimilation rate displayed compensatory responses in herbivore-damaged leaves compared with control leaves. This compensatory response was associated with an overall increase in chloroplast size. Feeding-induced emissions of products of the lipoxygenase pathway (LOX products; (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenol, 1-hexanol, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate) peaked at day 1 after larval feeding started, followed by an increase of emissions of ubiquitous monoterpenes peaking on days 2 and 3. The emission of the monoterpene (E)-β-ocimene and of the nerolidol-derived homoterpene 4,8-dimethyl-nona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT) peaked on day 3. Furthermore, the emission kinetics of the sesquiterpene (E,E)-α-farnesene tended to be biphasic with peaks on days 2 and 4 after start of larval feeding. Emission rates of the induced LOX products, of (E)-β-ocimene and (E,E)-α-farnesene were positively correlated with the number of larvae feeding. In contrast, the emission of DMNT was independent of the number of feeders. These data show quantitative relationships between the strength of herbivory and the emissions of LOX products and most of the terpenoids elicited in response to feeding. Thus, herbivory-elicited LOX products and terpenoid emissions may convey both quantitative and qualitative signals to antagonists of the herbivores. In contrast, our data suggest that the feeding-induced homoterpene DMNT conveys the information “presence of herbivores” rather than information about the quantities of herbivores to predators and parasitoids.},

            Enzymes empower chemical industries and are the keystone for metabolic engineering. For example, linalool synthases are indispensable for the biosynthesis of linalool, an important fragrance used in 60–80\% cosmetic and personal care products. However, plant linalool synthases have low activities while expressed in microbes. Aided by bioinformatics analysis, four linalool/nerolidol synthases (LNSs) from various Agaricomycetes were accurately predicted and validated experimentally. Furthermore, we discovered a linalool synthase (Ap.LS) with exceptionally high levels of selectivity and activity from Agrocybe pediades, ideal for linalool bioproduction. It effectively converted glucose into enantiopure (R)-linalool in Escherichia coli, 44-fold and 287-fold more efficient than its bacterial and plant counterparts, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the divergent evolution paths for plant, bacterial and fungal linalool synthases. More critically, structural comparison provided catalytic insights into Ap.LS superior specificity and activity, and mutational experiments validated the key residues responsible for the specificity.},

Volatiles are retained at high concentrations in these storage cavities with limited release into the atmosphere and without re-entering the secretory cells, where they would be toxic. This implies the existence of mechanisms allowing transport of VOCs to the cavity but preventing their diffusion out once they have been delivered. The cuticle and cell wall lining the cavity are likely to have key roles in retaining volatiles, but their exact composition and the potential molecular players involved are largely unknown.},

	abstract = {To help researchers conduct a systematic review or meta-analysis as efficiently and transparently as possible, we designed a tool to accelerate the step of screening titles and abstracts. For many tasks—including but not limited to systematic reviews and meta-analyses—the scientific literature needs to be checked systematically. Scholars and practitioners currently screen thousands of studies by hand to determine which studies to include in their review or meta-analysis. This is error prone and inefficient because of extremely imbalanced data: only a fraction of the screened studies is relevant. The future of systematic reviewing will be an interaction with machine learning algorithms to deal with the enormous increase of available text. We therefore developed an open source machine learning-aided pipeline applying active learning: ASReview. We demonstrate by means of simulation studies that active learning can yield far more efficient reviewing than manual reviewing while providing high quality. Furthermore, we describe the options of the free and open source research software and present the results from user experience tests. We invite the community to contribute to open source projects such as our own that provide measurable and reproducible improvements over current practice.},

Mechanistically, these volatiles can induce epigenetic regulation based on histone modifications that alter the transcriptional status of defense genes, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. To understand the roles of such epigenetic regulation of plant volatile signaling, we explored the response of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants to the volatile β-ocimene. Defense traits of Arabidopsis plants toward larvae of Spodoptera litura were induced in response to β-ocimene, through enriched histone acetylation and elevated transcriptional levels of defense gene regulators, including ethylene response factor genes (ERF8 and ERF104) in leaves. The enhanced defense ability of the plants was maintained for 5 d but not over 10 d after exposure to β-ocimene, and this coincided with elevated expression of those ERFs in their leaves. An array of histone acetyltransferases, including HAC1, HAC5, and HAM1, were responsible for the induction and maintenance of the anti-herbivore property. HDA6, a histone deacetylase, played a role in the reverse histone remodeling. Collectively, our findings illuminate the role of epigenetic regulation in plant volatile signaling.},

	abstract = {Some, but not all, plants emit isoprene. Emission of the related monoterpenes is more universal among plants, but the amount of isoprene emitted from plants dominates the biosphere–atmosphere hydrocarbon exchange.The emission of isoprene from plants affects atmospheric chemistry. Isoprene reacts very rapidly with hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere making hydroperoxides that can enhance ozone formation. Aerosol formation in the atmosphere may also be influenced by biogenic isoprene. Plants that emit isoprene are better able to tolerate sunlight-induced rapid heating of leaves (heat flecks). They also tolerate ozone and other reactive oxygen species better than non-emitting plants. Expression of the isoprene synthase gene can account for control of isoprene emission capacity as leaves expand. The emission capacity of fully expanded leaves varies through the season but the biochemical control of capacity of mature leaves appears to be at several different points in isoprene metabolism.The capacity for isoprene emission evolved many times in plants, probably as a mechanism for coping with heat flecks. It also confers tolerance of reactive oxygen species. It is an example of isoprenoids enhancing membrane function, although the mechanism is likely to be different from that of sterols. Understanding the regulation of isoprene emission is advancing rapidly now that the pathway that provides the substrate is known.},

Amino acids and their biosynthetic intermediates play key roles as precursors for the biosynthesis of plant volatiles. Different plants utilize different strategies and biosynthetic pathways to meet their specific biological needs. This review focuses on the different biosynthetic pathways that plants utilize to form amino acid-derived aroma volatiles, emphasizing their common and unique aspects and stressing the importance of the limiting enzymes residing in the primary-specialized metabolism interface. We also briefly review how biotechnology has used this interface and point to promising future directions for improving the quality of agricultural produce and the production of key volatiles.},

	abstract = {The unique aroma of melons (Cucumis melo L., Cucurbitaceae) is composed of many volatile compounds biosynthetically derived from fatty acids, carotenoids, amino acids, and terpenes. Although amino acids are known precursors of aroma compounds in the plant kingdom, the initial steps in the catabolism of amino acids into aroma volatiles have received little attention. Incubation of melon fruit cubes with amino acids and α-keto acids led to the enhanced formation of aroma compounds bearing the side chain of the exogenous amino or keto acid supplied. Moreover, L-[13C6]phenylalanine was also incorporated into aromatic volatile compounds. Amino acid transaminase activities extracted from the flesh of mature melon fruits converted L-isoleucine, L-leucine, L-valine, L-methionine, or L-phenylalanine into their respective α-keto acids, utilizing α-ketoglutarate as the amine acceptor. Two novel genes were isolated and characterized (CmArAT1 and CmBCAT1) encoding 45.6 kDa and 42.7 kDa proteins, respectively, that displayed aromatic and branched-chain amino acid transaminase activities, respectively, when expressed in Escherichia coli. The expression of CmBCAT1 and CmArAT1 was low in vegetative tissues, but increased in flesh and rind tissues during fruit ripening. In addition, ripe fruits of climacteric aromatic cultivars generally showed high expression of CmBCAT1 and CmArAT1 in contrast to non-climacteric non-aromatic fruits. The results presented here indicate that in melon fruit tissues, the catabolism of amino acids into aroma volatiles can initiate through a transamination mechanism, rather than decarboxylation or direct aldehyde synthesis, as has been demonstrated in other plants.},

Female M. caliginosus did not respond to volatiles from plants exposed to mirid feeding or to odours emitted directly by adult mirids. In contrast, male mirid bugs were attracted both to volatiles from plants previously exposed to feeding by conspecific females and to odours emitted by conspecifics only with a marginally significant preference for the former. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that mirid feeding induced the release of 11 additional compounds as compared to the volatiles emitted from clean plants. Three of these substances (5-ethyl-2(5H)-furanone, Z-3-hexenyl tiglate, and E,E-α-farnesene) were released only after feeding by females. Furthermore, 21 compounds were identified in volatiles emitted directly by mirids, 12 of which were unique to the mirids (i.e., not present in clean plants or plants previously exposed to mirid feeding). The results suggest that female-specific herbivore-induced plant volatiles play a role as mate-finding cues by the male mirids.

These were (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, hexyl acetate, (E)-β-ocimene, (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, (Z)-3-hexenyl butyrate, (E)-2-hexenyl butyrate, (Z)-3-hexenyl 2-methylbutyrate, (E)-2-hexenyl 2-methylbutyrate, and indole. The nature of this response is compared with other studies where herbivore-induced volatile responses are also known. The presence of large amounts of terpenes and aldehydes seen at the onset of feeding and the appearance of other compounds hours later suggest that cotton defense mechanisms may consist of a constitutive repertoire that is augmented by an induced mechanism mobilized in response to attack. A number of the induced compounds are common to many plants where, in addition to an immediate defensive function, they are known to be involved in the attraction of natural enemies.},

In this context, the egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis is attracted by oviposition-induced plant volatiles emitted by Vicia faba plants as a consequence of feeding and oviposition by the pentatomid host Nezara viridula. However, this local tritrophic web could be affected by the recent invasion by the alien pentatomid bug Halyomorpha halys, an herbivore that shares the same environments as native pentatomid pests. Therefore, we investigated in laboratory conditions the possible impact of H. halys on the plant volatile-mediated signalling in the local tritrophic web V. faba–N. viridula–T. basalis. We found that T. basalis wasps were not attracted by volatiles induced in the plants by feeding and oviposition activities of H. halys, indicating specificity in the wasps’ response. However, the parasitoid attraction towards plant volatiles emitted as a consequence of feeding and oviposition by the associated host was disrupted when host, N. viridula, and non-associated host, H. halys, were concurrently present on the same plant, indicating that invasion by the alien herbivore interferes with established semiochemical webs. These outcomes are discussed in a context of multiple herbivory by evaluating the possible influences of alien insects on local parasitoid foraging behaviour.},

In Y-tube olfactometer bioassays, using a system including a Vicia faba plant, the zoophytophagous predator Podisus maculiventris and the egg parasitoid Telenomus podisi, we first demonstrated that T. podisi females are attracted by broad bean plants damaged by feeding activity of P. maculiventris and on which host egg masses had been laid, while they are not attracted by undamaged plants or plants damaged by feeding activity alone. In a second experiment, we evaluated the impact of the invasive phytophagous pest Halyomorpha halys on this plant volatile-mediated tritrophic communication. Results showed that the invasive herbivorous adults do not induce plants to recruit the native egg parasitoid, but they can disrupt the local infochemical network. In fact, T. podisi females are not attracted by volatiles emitted by plants damaged by H. halys feeding alone or combined with oviposition activity, nor are they attracted by plants concurrently infested by P. maculiventris and H. halys, indicating the specificity in the parasitoid response and the ability of the invasive herbivore in interrupting the semiochemical communication between plants and native egg parasitoids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that zoophytophagous predator attacks induce indirect plant defences similarly to those defence strategies adopted by plants as a consequence of single or concurrent infestations of herbivorous insects.},

We studied the effects of pre-infestation with non-host aphids (Brevicoryne brassicae) for two different time periods on the ability of two parasitoid species to discriminate between volatiles emitted by plants infested by host caterpillars alone and those emitted by plants infested with host caterpillars plus aphids. Using plants originating from three chemically distinct wild cabbage (Brassica oleracea) populations, Diadegma semiclausum switched preference for dually infested plants to preference for plants infested with Plutella xylostella hosts alone when the duration of pre-aphid infestation doubled from 7 to 14 days. Microplitis mediator, a parasitoid of Mamestra brassicae caterpillars, preferred dually-infested plants irrespective of aphid-infestation duration. Separation of the volatile blends emitted by plants infested with hosts plus aphids or with hosts only was poor, based on multivariate statistics. However, emission rates of individual compounds were often reduced in plants infested with aphids plus hosts compared to those emitted by plants infested with hosts alone. This effect depended on host caterpillar species and plant population and was little affected by aphid infestation duration. Thus, the interactive effect of aphids and hosts on plant volatile production and parasitoid attraction can be dynamic and parasitoid specific. The characteristics of the multi-component volatile blends that determine parasitoid attraction are too complex to be deduced from simple correlative statistical analyses.},

Plants and insects are cornerstones of terrestrial ecosystems, and understanding communication between them is crucial to describing the full scope of their interactions and how human-caused disturbances disrupt those interactions. Here, we outline sources of noise affecting parts of the signaling channels between plants and insects: signal generation by plants, transmission through the air, and reception by insects. Sources of noise include environmental variation that affects plant and insect physiologies, as well as turbulence and chemical interference. Information theory provides methods for analyzing chemical communication and hypotheses for how selection might act to reduce noise.},

We found that jasmonic acid-insensitive1 (jai1) mutant plants with both reduced HIPVs and trichome production received higher oviposition of adult leafminers, which were more likely to be parasitized by the leafminer parasitoids than JA biosynthesis spr2 mutant plants deficient in HIPVs but not trichomes. We also showed that the preference and acceptance of leafminers and parasitoids to trichome-removed plants from either spr2 or wild-type (WT) genotypes over trichome-intact genotypes can be ascribed to the reduced trichomes on treated plants, but not to altered direct and indirect defence traits such as JA, proteinase inhibitor (PI)-II and HIPVs levels. Although the HIPVs of WT plants were more attractive to adult insects, the insects preferred trichome-free jai1 plants for oviposition and also had greater reproductive success on these plants. Our results provide strong evidence that antagonism between HIPV emission and trichome production affects tritrophic interactions. The interactions among defence traits are discussed.},

Recent research shows that effects of plants on insect interactions are not curious phenomena confined to a few specialist species but rather that they are ubiquitous in terrestrial ecosystems and often involve complex interactions among many species. The major challenge now is to study how the commonly reported short-term effects of plants affect long term dynamics of insect interactions in the context of complex natural communities.},

The identification of these plant volatile compounds is essential for our understanding of plant–insect relationships and contributes to plant breeding for improved resistance against insects. Chemical analysis of grape headspace and subsequent behavioural studies in the wind tunnel show that host finding in grapevine moth Lobesia botrana is encoded by a ratio-specific blend of three ubiquitous plant volatiles. The odour signal that attracts mated females to grape consists of the terpenoids (E)-β-caryophyllene, (E)-β-farnesene and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene. These compounds represent only a fraction of the volatiles released by grapes, and they are widespread compounds known throughout the plant kingdom. Specificity may be achieved by the blend ratio, which was 100:78:9 in grape headspace. This blend elicited anemotactic behaviour in moths at remarkably small amounts. Females were attracted at release rates of only a few nanograms per minute, at levels nearly as low as those known for the attraction of male moths to the female sex pheromones.},

Nonvolatile hormone analogues and biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) evolved in tandem as growth and behavioural regulators in unicellular organisms. In plants, however, nonvolatile hormones evolved as regulators of growth, development and differentiation, while endogenous BVOCs (often synthesised lifelong) became subtle regulators of hormone synthesis, availability, activity and turnover, all supported by functionally redundant components of hormone metabolism. Reciprocal changes in the abundance and activity of hormones, nitric oxide, and constitutive plant volatiles constantly bridge retrograde and anterograde signalling to maintain hormone equilibria even in unstressed plants.

Recent work provides a potential mechanistic explanation for these observations by showing that volatile cues can modulate different hormonal pathways, including jasmonate (JA), salicylic acid (SA) and auxin (IAA) signaling. Many of these pathways interact with each other through crosstalk. Thus, volatiles may suppress plant defenses through negative hormonal crosstalk. Hormonal crosstalk may also allow plants to integrate different volatile cues to respond specifically and appropriately to environmental change.},

Although plant‒plant communication occurs in a wide range of plant species, most studies have focused on herbaceous plants. Here, we investigated plant‒plant communication in beech trees in two experimental plantations in 2018 and one plantation in 2019. Approximately 20\% of the leaves of a beech tree were clipped in half in the spring seasons of 2018 and 2019 (clipped tree). The damage levels to leaves in the surrounding undamaged beech trees were evaluated 90 days after the clipping (assay trees). In both years, the damage levels decreased with a reduction in the distance from the clipped tree. In 2019, we also recorded the damage levels of trees that were not exposed to volatiles (nonexposed trees) as control trees and found that those that were located {\textless}5 m away from clipped trees had significantly less leaf damage than nonexposed trees. By using a gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer, ten and eight volatile compounds were detected in the headspaces of clipped and unclipped leaves, respectively. Among them, the amount of (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate in clipped leaves was significantly higher than that in nonclipped leaves. Our result suggests that green leaf volatiles such as (Z)-3-hexenol and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate and other volatile organic compounds emitted from clipped trees induced defenses in the neighboring trees within the 5 m radius. The effective distances of plant‒plant communication in trees were discussed from the viewpoint of the arthropod community structure in forest ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The functional reasons for isoprene emission are still a matter of hot debate. It was hypothesized that isoprene biosynthesis evolved as an ancestral mechanism in plants adapted to high water availability, to cope with transient and recurrent oxidative stresses during their water-to-land transition. There is a tight association between isoprene emission and species hygrophily, suggesting that isoprene emission may be a favorable trait to cope with occasional exposure to stresses in mesic environments. The suite of morpho-anatomical traits does not allow a conservative water use in hygrophilic mesophytes challenged by the environmental pressures imposed or exacerbated by drought and heat stress. There is evidence that in stressed plants the biosynthesis of isoprene is uncoupled from photosynthesis. Because the biosynthesis of isoprene is costly, the great investment of carbon and energy into isoprene must have relevant functional reasons. Isoprene is effective in preserving the integrity of thylakoid membranes, not only through direct interaction with their lipid acyl chains, but also by up-regulating proteins associated with photosynthetic complexes and enhancing the biosynthesis of relevant membrane components, such as mono- and di-galactosyl-diacyl glycerols and unsaturated fatty acids. Isoprene may additionally protect photosynthetic membranes by scavenging reactive oxygen species. Here we explore the mode of actions and the potential significance of isoprene in the response of hygrophilic plants when challenged by severe stress conditions associated to rapid climate change in temperate climates, with special emphasis to the concomitant effect of drought and heat. We suggest that isoprene emission may be not a good estimate for its biosynthesis and concentration in severely droughted leaves, being the internal concentration of isoprene the important trait for stress protection.},

	abstract = {A range of plant species, including crops, shrubs, herbs, and trees, was surveyed to determine the magnitude of isoprene emissions. In studies to determine if plants emitted isoprene, greenhouse-grown plants were encapsulated in impermeable plastic bags and kept in a growth chamber for 2 h at 30 C and a photosynthetic photon flux density of ca. 350 μE m-2 s-1. To estimate emission rates, greenhouse-grown plants were conditioned in a growth chamber and transferred to a controlled-environment gas-exchange chamber. Gas samples from either the encapsulation bags or gas-exchange chamber were collected, concentrated cryogenically, and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. The occurrence of isoprene and monoterpenes was confirmed by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Of the 54 plant species tested, 37 emitted isoprene. Isoprene emission rates (28 C and 1,000 μE m-2 s-1) for 16 species ranged from 0 to 38.5 μg carbon g-1 h-1. Monoterpenes were detected from six species and emission rates ranged from 0.01 to 3.53 μg carbon g-1 h-1. The encapsulation technique permitted rapid identification of species that emitted isoprene. The emission rate data confirmed the preliminary isoprene ranking and demonstrated the differences between monoterpene and isoprene emissions.},

	abstract = {Cross-species communication, where signals are sent by one species and perceived by others, is one of the most intriguing types of communication that functionally links different species to form complex ecological networks. Global change and human activity can affect communication by increasing fluctuations in species composition and phenology, altering signal profiles and intensity, and introducing noise. So far, most studies on cross-species communication have focused on a few specific species isolated from ecological communities. Scaling up investigations of cross-species communication to the community level is currently hampered by a lack of conceptual and practical methodologies. Here, we propose an interdisciplinary framework based on information theory to investigate mechanisms shaping cross-species communication at the community level. We use plants and insects, the cornerstones of most ecosystems, as a showcase and focus on chemical communication as the key communication channel. We first introduce some basic concepts of information theory, then we illustrate information patterns in plant–insect chemical communication, followed by a further exploration of how to integrate information theory into ecological and evolutionary processes to form testable mechanistic hypotheses. We conclude by highlighting the importance of community-level information as a means to better understand the maintenance and workings of ecological systems, especially during rapid global change.},

Here, we investigated the isoprenoid emission from two Mediterranean Cistaceae shrubs, Halimium halimifolium and Cistus ladanifer, under controlled and natural conditions, respectively. For the first time, diurnal emission patterns of the diterpene kaurene were detected in real-time by Proton-Transfer-Reaction-Time-of-Flight-Mass-Spectrometer. Kaurene emissions were strongly variable among H. halimifolium plants, ranging from 0.01 ± 0.003 to 0.06 ± 0.01 nmol m−2 s−1 in low and high emitting individuals, respectively. They were in the same order of magnitude as monoterpene (0.01 ± 0.01 to 0.11 ± 0.04 nmol m−2 s−1) and sesquiterpene (0.01 ± 0.01 to 0.52 nmol m−2 s−1) emission rates. Comparable range and variability was found for C. ladanifer under natural conditions. Labelling with 13C-pyruvate suggested that emitted kaurene was not derived from de novo biosynthesis. The high kaurene content in leaves, the weak relationship with ecophysiological parameters and the tendency of higher emissions with increasing temperatures in the field indicate an emission from storage pools. This study highlights significant emissions of kaurene from two Mediterranean shrub species, indicating that the release of diterpenes into the atmosphere should probably deserve more attention in the future.},

However, the metrics used to measure academic success, such as the number of publications, citation number, and impact factor, have not changed for decades. Moreover, recent studies indicate that these metrics have become targets and follow Goodhart’s Law, according to which, “when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”In this study, we analyzed \&gt;120 million papers to examine how the academic publishing world has evolved over the last century, with a deeper look into the specific field of biology. Our study shows that the validity of citation-based measures is being compromised and their usefulness is lessening. In particular, the number of publications has ceased to be a good metric as a result of longer author lists, shorter papers, and surging publication numbers. Citation-based metrics, such citation number and h-index, are likewise affected by the flood of papers, self-citations, and lengthy reference lists. Measures such as a journal’s impact factor have also ceased to be good metrics due to the soaring numbers of papers that are published in top journals, particularly from the same pool of authors. Moreover, by analyzing properties of \&gt;2,600 research fields, we observed that citation-based metrics are not beneficial for comparing researchers in different fields, or even in the same department.Academic publishing has changed considerably; now we need to reconsider how we measure success.},

An appropriate behavioural response to sensory cues from plants and other insects is crucial for survival and fitness. As the natural environment can show both large spatial and temporal variability, herbivores may need to show behavioural plasticity to the available cues. By using earlier experiences, insects can adapt to local variation of resources. Experience is well known to affect sensory-guided behaviour in parasitoids and social insects, but there is also increasing evidence that it influences host plant choice and the probability of finding a mating partner in herbivorous insects. In this review, we will focus upon behavioural changes in holometabolous insect herbivores during host plant choice and localization of mating partners, modulated by experience to sensory cues. The experience can be acquired during both the larval and the adult stage and can influence later responses to plant volatiles and other sensory cues not only within the developmental stage but also after metamorphosis. Furthermore, we will address the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the experience-dependent behavioural adaptations and discuss ecological and evolutionary aspects of insect behavioural plasticity based upon experience.},

	abstract = {Insects are able to detect a plethora of olfactory cues using a divergent family of odorant receptors (ORs). Despite the divergent nature of this family, related species frequently express several evolutionarily conserved OR orthologues. In the largest order of insects, Coleoptera, it remains unknown whether OR orthologues have conserved or divergent functions in different species. Using HEK293 cells, we addressed this question through functional characterization of two groups of OR orthologues in three species of the Curculionidae (weevil) family, the conifer-feeding bark beetles Ips typographus L. (“Ityp”) and Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (“Dpon”) (Scolytinae), and the pine weevil Hylobius abietis L. (“Habi”; Molytinae). The ORs of H. abietis were annotated from antennal transcriptomes. The results show highly conserved response specificities, with one group of orthologues (HabiOR3/DponOR8/ItypOR6) responding exclusively to 2-phenylethanol (2-PE), and the other group (HabiOR4/DponOR9/ItypOR5) responding to angiosperm green leaf volatiles (GLVs). Both groups of orthologues belong to the coleopteran OR subfamily 2B, and share a common ancestor with OR5 in the cerambycid Megacyllene caryae, also tuned to 2-PE, suggesting a shared evolutionary history of 2-PE receptors across two beetle superfamilies. The detected compounds are ecologically relevant for conifer-feeding curculionids, and are probably linked to fitness, with GLVs being used to avoid angiosperm nonhost plants, and 2-PE being important for intraspecific communication and/or playing a putative role in beetle–microbe symbioses. To our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal evolutionary conservation of OR functions across several beetle species and hence sheds new light on the functional evolution of insect ORs.},

They enhance the ability of pollinators and herbivores to locate suitable host plants, and parasitoids to locate herbivores. While plant volatiles provide strong chemical signals, these signals are potentially degraded by exposure to pollutants such as ozone, which has increased in the troposphere and is projected to continue to increase over the coming decades. Despite the potential broad ecological significance of reduced plant signaling effectiveness, few studies have examined behavioral responses of insects to their hosts in polluted environments. Here, we use a laboratory study to test the effect of ozone concentration gradients on the ability of the striped cucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum) to locate flowers of its host plant, Cucurbita foetidissima. Y-tube experiments showed that ozone mixing ratios below 80 parts per billion (ppb) resulted in beetles moving toward their host plant, but levels above 80 ppb resulted in beetles moving randomly with respect to host location. There was no evidence that beetles avoided polluted air directly. The results show that ozone pollution has great potential to perniciously alter key interactions between plants and animals.},

By releasing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), plants signal the presence of host insects and thereby attract nematodes. 2. Nonetheless, how roots deploy indirect defences, how indirect defences relate to direct defences, and the ecological consequences of root defence allocation for herbivores and plant biomass are essentially unknown. 3. We investigate a natural below-ground tritrophic system, involving common milkweed, a specialist root-boring beetle and entomopathogenic nematodes, and asked whether there is a negative genetic correlation between direct defences (root cardenolides) and indirect defences (emission of volatiles in the roots and nematode attraction), and between constitutive and inducible defences. 4. Volatiles of roots were analysed using two distinct sampling methods. First, we collected emissions from living Asclepias syriaca roots by dynamic headspace sampling. This method showed that attacked A. syriaca plants emit five times higher levels of volatiles than control plants. Secondly, we used a solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) method to sample the full pool of volatiles in roots for genetic correlations of volatile biosynthesis. 5. Field experiments showed that entomopathogenic nematodes prevent the loss of biomass to root herbivory. Additionally, suppression of root herbivores was mediated directly by cardenolides and indirectly by the attraction of nematodes. Genetic families of plants with high cardenolides benefited less from nematodes compared to low-cardenolide families, suggesting that direct and indirect defences may be redundant. Although constitutive and induced root defences traded off within each strategy (for both direct and indirect defence, cardenolides and VOCs, respectively), we found no trade-off between the two strategies. 6. Synthesis. Constitutive expression and inducibility of defences may trade off because of resource limitation or because they are redundant. Direct and indirect defences do not trade off, likely because they may not share a limiting resource and because independently they may promote defence across the patchiness of herbivore attack and nematode presence in the field. Indeed, some redundancy in strategies may be necessary to increase effective defence, but for each strategy, an economy of deployment reduces overall costs.},

We studied aphid settling on barley plants exposed to volatiles from different cultivars, aphid population development in monocultures and two-cultivar mixtures, and differences in volatile composition between studied cultivars. Aphid responses to one cultivar in a mixture were neighbor-specific and this was more important for pest suppression than the overall mixture effect, aphid colonization patterns, or natural enemy abundance. Aphid populations decreased most in a mixture where both cultivars showed a reduced aphid–plant acceptance after reciprocal volatile exposure in the laboratory, and reduced population growth compared to monocultures in the field. Our findings suggest that herbivore population responses to crop genotypic diversity can depend on plant–plant volatile interactions, which can lead to changes in herbivore response to individual cultivars in a mixture, resulting in slower population growth. The impact of plant–plant interaction through volatiles on associated herbivore species is rarely considered, but improved understanding of these mechanisms would advance our understanding of the ecological consequences of biodiversity and guide development of sustainable agricultural practices. Combining cultivars in mixtures based on how they interact with each other is a promising strategy for sustainable pest management.},

Identification of stimuli that trigger upwind flight attraction toward host plants is a current challenge, and is essential in developing new, sustainable plant protection methods, and for furthering our understanding of plant-insect interactions. Using behavioral, analytical and electrophysiological studies, we here show that both females and males of the Egyptian cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), use blends of volatile compounds to locate their host plant, cotton, Gossypium hirsutum (Malvales, Malvaceae). Female S. littoralis were engaged in upwind orientation flight in a wind tunnel when headspace collected from cotton plants was delivered through a piezoelectric sprayer. Although males took off toward cotton headspace significantly fewer males than females flew upwind toward the sprayed headspace. Subsequent assays with antennally active synthetic compounds revealed that a blend of nonanal, (Z)-3 hexenyl acetate, (E)-β-ocimene, and (R)-(+)-limonene was as attractive as cotton headspace to females and more attractive to males. Two compounds, 4,8-dimethyl-1,3(E),7-nonatriene (DMNT) and (R)-(−)-linalool, both known plant defense compounds may have reduced the flight attraction of both females and males; more moths were attracted to blends without these two compounds, however, other compounds such as benzaldehyde may also be behavioral antagonists. Our findings provide a platform for further investigations on host plant signals mediating innate behavior, and for the development of novel insect plant protection strategies against S. littoralis.},

However, numerous studies indicate that this is not always the case for polyphagous species. Lymantria dispar is a highly polyphagous forest defoliator and has flightless females in some subspecies, resulting in a limited capacity to make host-choices. Males of other Lepidopteran species utilize a combination of sexual pheromones and plant volatiles in their mating choices and exhibit preferences among plant species. We explored the behavior of L. dispar males towards sexual pheromone in the presence and absence of plant volatiles and their ability to discriminate between two plant species with different degrees of suitability for their offspring: a suboptimal host (Pinus sylvestris), and an optimal host (Quercus robur). In no-choice wind tunnel assays, we found that rates of male success in locating a pheromone source were not altered by the presence of plant odors; however, the time spent by males searching for the pheromone source after reaching the full length of the tunnel was reduced by more than 50\% in the presence of plant volatiles. In dual choice assays, males exhibited a clear preference for a combination of pheromones and plant volatiles over the pheromone alone. However, we did not find evidence of an innate ability to discriminate between the odors of optimal and suboptimal host plants. We discuss possible ecological and evolutionary explanations for these observations.},

Plant-produced volatile compounds mediate various aspects of plant defence. The emission of volatiles has costs and benefits. Research on the role of plant volatiles in defence has focused primarily on the responses of individual plants. However, in nature, plants rarely occur as isolated individuals but are members of plant communities where they compete for resources and exchange information with other plants. In this review, we address the effects of neighbouring plants on plant volatile-mediated defences. We will outline the various roles of volatile compounds in the interactions between plants and other organisms, address the mechanisms of plant neighbour perception in plant communities, and discuss how neighbour detection and volatile signalling are interconnected. Finally, we will outline the most urgent questions to be addressed in the future.},

In response to environmental changes, the status of a plant is transmitted to other plants in the form of signals such as volatiles. Root-associated bacteria trigger the release of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, the impact of VOCs on the rhizosphere microbial community of neighbouring plants is not well understood. Here, we investigated the effect of VOCs on the rhizosphere microbial community of tomato plants inoculated with a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain GB03 and that of their neighbouring plants. Interestingly, high similarity (up to 69\%) was detected in the rhizosphere microbial communities of the inoculated and neighbouring plants. Leaves of the tomato plant treated with strain GB03-released β-caryophyllene as a signature VOC, which elicited the release of a large amount of salicylic acid (SA) in the root exudates of a neighbouring tomato seedling. The exposure of tomato leaves to β-caryophyllene resulted in the secretion of SA from the root. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the composition of the rhizosphere microbiota in surrounding plants is synchronized through aerial signals from plants.},

	abstract = {β-Ocimene is a very common plant volatile released in important amounts from the leaves and flowers of many plant species. This acyclic monoterpene can play several biological functions in plants, by potentially affecting floral visitors and also by mediating defensive responses to herbivory. The ubiquity and high relative abundance of β-ocimene in the floral scents of species from most plant families and from different pollination syndromes (ranging from generalism to specialism) strongly suggest that this terpenoid may play an important role in the attraction of pollinators to flowers. We compiled abundant evidence from published studies that supports β-ocimene as a generalist attractant of a wide spectrum of pollinators. We found no studies testing behavioural responses of pollinators to β-ocimene, that could directly demonstrate or deny the function of β-ocimene in pollinator attraction; but several case studies support that the emissions of β-ocimene in flowers of different species follow marked temporal and spatial patterns of emission, which are typical from floral volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions that are involved in pollinator attraction. Furthermore, important β-ocimene emissions are induced from vegetative plant tissues after herbivory in many species, which have relevant functions in the establishment of tritrophic interactions. We thus conclude that β-ocimene is a key plant volatile with multiple relevant functions in plants, depending on the organ and the time of emission. Experimental behavioural studies on pure β-ocimene conducted with pollinating insects will be necessary to prove the assumptions made here.},

The attraction to herbivore-induced Plant Volatiles (HIPVs) has been well documented for arthropod predators and parasitoids, and more recently for insectivorous birds. The attraction to plant volatiles induced by the exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA), a phytohormone typically produced in response to an attack of chewing herbivores, has provided controversial results both in arthropod and avian predators. In this study, we examined whether potential differences in the composition of bouquets of volatiles produced by herbivore-induced and MeJA-treated Pyrenean oak trees (Quercus pyrenaica) were related to differential avian attraction, as results from a previous study suggested. Results showed that the overall emission of volatiles produced by MeJA-treated and herbivore-induced trees did not differ, and were higher than emissions of Control trees, although MeJA treatment showed a more significant reaction and released several specific compounds in contrast to herbivore-induced trees. These slight yet significant differences in the volatile composition may explain why avian predators were not so attracted to MeJA-treated trees, as observed in a previous study in this plant-herbivore system. Unfortunately, the lack of avian visits to the experimental trees in the current study did not allow us to confirm this result and points out the need to perform more robust predator studies.},

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that chemical cues play a pivotal role in host selection by the natural enemies of aphids. We use Vinson's (1976) division of the host selection process into habitat location, host location and host acceptance for both parasitoids and predators and review what is known about the role of semiochemicals in aphid selection by natural enemies. For habitat location (i.e. detection of the host plant), volatiles emitted by plants after aphid attack have been described for a number of plant-aphid interactions. These synomones indicate not only the presence of an aphid host plant to the predator or parasitoid, but also the presence of aphids. Volatiles emitted from undamaged host plants are often attractive to aphid parasitoids, but less so for predators. Host location by the natural enemy on the food plant is guided by semiochemicals that mostly originate from the aphids, in particular aphid alarm pheromone, honeydew, or the smell of the aphid itself. Host acceptance is guided by contact chemicals for both predators and parasitoids. In parasitoids, host recognition may be based on visual cues or on contact chemicals on the aphid's cuticle, whereas host acceptance is ultimately based on as yet unknown substances within the aphid's hemolymph. While it appears that many predators and parasitoids are attracted to the same semiochemicals, synergistic and antagonistic interactions among chemical substances have only rarely been investigated. More research into model systems is needed, not only to identify important semiochemicals, but also to determine their range of attraction. Recent progress in the development of analytical techniques has created new opportunities to improve our understanding of the chemical ecology of aphid-natural enemy interactions in the coming years.},

Although grapevine VOCs responsible for wine aroma and plant–insect communications are well characterized, functional properties of VOCs produced in response to phytopathogens, beneficial microorganisms, resistance inducers, and abiotic factors have been less studied. In this review, we focused on the emission patterns and potential biological functions of VOCs produced by grapevines in response to stimuli. Specific grapevine VOCs are emitted in response to the exogenous stimulus, suggesting their precise involvement in plant defence response. VOCs with inhibitory activities against pathogens and responsible for plant resistance induction are reported, and some of them can also be used as biomarkers of grapevine resistance. Likewise, VOCs produced in response to beneficial microorganisms and environmental factors are possible mediators of grapevine–microbe communications and abiotic stress tolerance. Although further functional studies may improve our knowledge, the existing literature suggests that VOCs have an underestimated potential application as pathogen inhibitors, resistance inducers against biotic or abiotic stresses, signalling molecules, membrane stabilizers, and modulators of reactive oxygen species. VOC patterns could also be used to screen for resistant traits or to monitor the plant physiological status.},

	abstract = {Plants release volatile chemicals upon attack by herbivorous arthropods. They do so commonly in a dose-dependent manner: the more herbivores, the more volatiles released. The volatiles attract predatory arthropods and the amount determines the probability of predator response. We show that seedlings of a cabbage variety (Brassica oleracea var. capitata, cv Shikidori) also show such a response to the density of cabbage white (Pieris rapae) larvae and attract more (naive) parasitoids (Cotesia glomerata) when there are more herbivores on the plant. However, when attacked by diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) larvae, seedlings of the same variety (cv Shikidori) release volatiles, the total amount of which is high and constant and thus independent of caterpillar density, and naive parasitoids (Cotesia vestalis) of diamondback moth larvae fail to discriminate herbivore-rich from herbivore-poor plants. In contrast, seedlings of another cabbage variety of B. oleracea (var. acephala: kale) respond in a dose-dependent manner to the density of diamondback moth larvae and attract more parasitoids when there are more herbivores. Assuming these responses of the cabbage cultivars reflect behaviour of at least some genotypes of wild plants, we provide arguments why the behaviour of kale (B. oleracea var acephala) is best interpreted as an honest signaling strategy and that of cabbage cv Shikidori (B. oleracea var capitata) as a “cry wolf” signaling strategy, implying a conflict of interest between the plant and the enemies of its herbivores: the plant profits from being visited by the herbivore's enemies, but the latter would be better off by visiting other plants with more herbivores. If so, evolutionary theory on alarm signaling predicts consequences of major interest to students of plant protection, tritrophic systems and communication alike.},

Many of these interactions are mediated by photo-assimilates that are excreted by plant roots. Root exudates are not mere waste products, but serve numerous functions to control abiotic and biotic processes. These functions range from changing the chemical and physical properties of the soil, inhibiting the growth of competing plants, combatting herbivores, and regulating the microbial community. Particularly intriguing are root-released compounds that have evolved to serve mutualistic interactions with soil-dwelling organisms. These mutually beneficial plant-mediated signals are not only of fundamental ecological interest, but also exceedingly important from an agronomical perspective. Here, we attempt to provide an overview of the plant-produced compounds that have so far been implicated in mutualistic interactions. We propose that these mutualistic signals may have evolved from chemical defenses and we point out that they can be (mis)used by specialized pathogens and herbivores. We speculate that many more signals and interactions remain to be uncovered and that a good understanding of the mechanisms and ecological implications can be the basis for exploitation and manipulation of the signals for crop improvement and protection.},

Plants represent an interesting example of phenotypic plasticity which also directly represents and affects the dynamics of biological interactions occurring in a community. Insects, which interact with plants, manifest phenotypic plasticity in their developmental, physiological, morphological or behavioral traits in response to the various host plant defenses induced upon herbivory. However, plant-insect interactions are generally more complex and multidimensional because of their dynamic association with their respective microbiomes and macrobiomes. Moreover, these associations can alter plant and insect responses towards each other by modulating the degree of phenotypic plasticity in their various traits and studying them will provide insights into how plants and insects reciprocally affect each other’s evolutionary trajectory. Further, we explore the consequences of phenotypic plasticity on relationships and interactions between plants and insects and its impact on their development, evolution, speciation and ecological organization. This overview, obtained after exploring and comparing data obtained from several inter-disciplinary studies, reveals how genetic and molecular mechanisms, underlying plasticity in traits, impact species interactions at the community level and also identifies mechanisms that could be exploited in breeding programs.},

Maize plants can be induced to produce the same blend of attractive volatiles by treating them with regurgitant of Spodoptera species. We collected and analyzed the regurgitant-induced emissions of two plant species (cowpea and maize) and of eight Mexican maize varieties and found significant differences among their volatile emissions, both in terms of total quantity and the quality of the blends. In a Y-tube olfactometer, the odors of the same artificially induced plant species and Mexican varieties were offered in dual choice experiments to naïve mated females of C. marginiventris. Wasps preferred cowpea over maize odor and, in 3 of 12 combinations with the maize varieties, they showed a preference for the odors of one of the varieties. A comparison of the odor collection with results from the behavioral assays indicates that not only the quantity of the volatile emissions, but also the quality composition of the volatile blends is important for attraction of C. marginiventris. The results are discussed in the context of the possibility of breeding crop varieties that are particularly attractive to parasitoids.},

Semiochemicals emitted by host plants can prime neigbouring plants to adjust their defensive mechanism against future attack. Crop protection, using plant signal is recently gaining momentum due to health and environmental concerns about the use of synthetic pesticides. Semiochemicals have successfully been used to protect maize from the stem borer through the Push /Pull technology. Chromolaena odorata plant is known to support a large and varied insect fauna although the chemistry involved has not been fully established. To determine the volatiles emitted by the undamaged C. odorata plant that might be associated with the insect plant interaction, Dynamic headspace technique was used to collect volatiles from the plant under laboratory conditions and analysed using a Gas chromatography and Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). Thirty three compounds were identified from the collected headspace volatile from the plant. (3E)-4,8dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), 4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT) and E-β-farnesene are three semiochemicals identified that had not been reported to be emitted by an intact C. odorata plant from Ghana.},

	abstract = {Trees are large organisms that structure forest ecosystems by providing an environment for an enormous diversity of animal, microbial and plant species. As these species use trees as their common hosts, many are likely to interact with each other directly or indirectly. From studies on herbaceous plant species we know that microbes can affect the interaction of plants with herbivorous insects, for example via changes in plant metabolite profiles. The consequences of fungal colonization for tree-insect interactions are, however, barely known, despite the importance of these ecological communities. In this review we explore the interaction of leaf-inhabiting pathogenic and endophytic fungi with trees and the consequences for tree-living insect herbivores. We discuss molecular, physiological, chemical, biochemical and ecological aspects of tree-fungus interactions and summarize the current knowledge on the direct and indirect effects of tree-inhabiting fungi on insect herbivores. Our mechanistic understanding of the tripartite interaction of trees with leaf-inhabiting fungi and insect herbivores is still in its infancy. We are currently facing substantial drawbacks in experimental methodology that prevent us from revealing the effect of one single fungal species on a particular insect herbivore species and vice versa. Future studies applying a versatile toolbox of modern molecular, chemical analytical and ecological techniques in combined laboratory and field experiments will unequivocally lead to a better understanding of fungus-tree-insect interactions.},

	abstract = {Maize plants under attack by caterpillars emit a specific blend of volatiles that is highly attractive to parasitic wasps. The release of these signals is induced by elicitors in the caterpillar regurgitant. Studies suggest that plants respond differently to different herbivore species and even to different herbivore stages, thus providing parasitoids and predators with specific signals. We tested if this is the case for different larval instars of the noctuid moth Spodoptera littoralis when they feed on maize plants. Cut maize plants were incubated in diluted regurgitant from second, third, or fifth instar caterpillars. There were no differences in total amount released after these treatments, but there were small differences in the release of the minor compounds phenethyl acetate and α-humulene. Regurgitant of all three instars contained the elicitor volicitin. To test the effect of actual feeding by the larvae, potted plants were infested with caterpillars of one of the three instars, and volatiles were collected the following day. The intensity of the emissions was correlated with the number of larvae feeding on a plant, and with the amount of damage inflicted, but was independent of the instar that caused the damage. We also used artificial damage to mimic the manner of feeding of each instar to test the importance of physical aspects of damages for the odor emission. The emission was highly variable, but no differences were found among the different types of damage. In olfactometer tests, Microplitis rufiventris, a parasitoid that can only successfully parasitize second and early third instar S. littoralis, did not differentiate among the odors of maize plants attacked by different instar larvae. The odor analyses as well as the parasitoid's responses indicate that maize odors induced by S. littoralis provide parasitoids with poor information on the larval developmental stage. We discuss the results in the context of variability and lack of specificity in odorous plant signals.},

	abstract = {To successfully exert defenses against herbivores and pathogens plants need to recognize reliable cues produced by their attackers. Up to now, few elicitors associated with herbivorous insects have been identified. We have previously shown that accessory reproductive gland secretions associated with eggs of Cabbage White butterflies (Pieris spp.) induce chemical changes in Brussels sprouts plants recruiting egg-killing parasitoids. Only secretions of mated female butterflies contain minute amounts of male-derived anti-aphrodisiac compounds that elicit this indirect plant defense. Here, we used the black mustard (Brassica nigra) to investigate how eggs of the Large Cabbage White butterfly (Pieris brassicae) induce, either an egg-killing direct [i.e., hypersensitive response (HR)-like necrosis] or indirect defense (i.e., oviposition-induced plant volatiles attracting Trichogramma egg parasitoids). Plants induced by P. brassicae egg-associated secretions expressed both traits and previous mating enhanced elicitation. Treatment with the anti-aphrodisiac compound of P. brassicae, benzyl cyanide (BC), induced stronger HR when compared to controls. Expression of the salicylic (SA) pathway- and HR-marker PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENE1 was induced only in plants showing an HR-like necrosis. Trichogramma wasps were attracted to volatiles induced by secretion of mated P. brassicae females but application of BC did not elicit the parasitoid-attracting volatiles. We conclude that egg-associated secretions of Pieris butterflies contain specific elicitors of the different plant defense traits against eggs in Brassica plants. While in Brussels sprouts plants anti-aphrodisiac compounds in Pieris egg-associated secretions were clearly shown to elicit indirect defense, the wild relative B. nigra, recognizes different herbivore cues that mediate the defensive responses. These results add another level of specificity to the mechanisms by which plants recognize their attackers.},

	abstract = {Multiple species of phytophagous insects may co-occur on a plant and while plants can defend themselves from insect herbivory, plant responses to damage by different species and feeding guilds of insects may be asymmetric. Plants can trigger specific responses to elicitors/effectors in insect secretions altering herbivore performance. Recently, maize chitinases present in fall armyworm (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda) frass were shown to act as effectors suppressing caterpillar-induced defenses in maize while increasing caterpillar performance. We investigated the effect of frass chitinase-mediated suppression of herbivore defenses in maize on the performance and preference of a subsequent insect herbivore from a different feeding guild, corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis). Aphid performance was highest on plants with FAW damage without frass chitinases compared to damaged plants with frass chitinases or undamaged plants. Plant exposure to frass chitinases post FAW damage also altered the production of herbivore-induced volatile compounds compared to damaged, buffer-treated plants. However, aphid preference to damaged, frass chitinase-treated plants was not different from damaged, buffer-treated plants or undamaged plants. This study suggests that frass effector-mediated alteration of plant defenses affects insect herbivores asymmetrically; while it enhances the performance of caterpillars, it suppresses the performance of subsequent herbivores from a different feeding guild.},

	abstract = {Many carnivorous arthropods use herbivore-induced plant volatiles to locate their prey. These plant volatiles are blends of up to hundreds of compounds. It is often unknown which compounds in such a complex volatile blend represent the signal to the foraging carnivore. We studied the role of methyl salicylate (MeSA) as part of the volatile blend in the foraging behavior of the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis by using a Y-tube olfactometer. MeSA is one of the compounds released by lima bean, infested with Tetranychus urticae—a prey species of the predatory mite. MeSA attracted satiated predatory mites in a dose-dependent way with optimum attraction at a dose of 0.2 μg. Predatory mites did not discriminate between a prey-induced lima bean volatile blend (that contains MeSA) and a prey-induced volatile blend to which an extra amount of synthetic MeSA had been added. However, they preferred a MeSA-containing volatile blend (induced by T. urticae) to an otherwise similar but MeSA-free blend (induced by jasmonic acid). Adding synthetic MeSA to the MeSA-free blend significantly increased the mites' choice for this odor, suggesting an important role for MeSA. This study is a new step toward unraveling the role of herbivore-induced plant volatiles in the foraging behavior of predatory arthropods.},

	abstract = {The area of plant volatile signaling in multitrophic interactions has developed one of the fascinating and fastest growing fields of research. It has been reported that plant leaves generally release minor quantities of volatile compounds, but when a plant is damaged by insects, several more volatiles are released. Numerous studies have demonstrated the dynamic role of herbivore-damaged plants in the attraction of natural enemies (predators and parasitoids). Volatile plant compounds released in response to insect feeding serve as a chemical signal for herbivore natural enemies. Volatiles released by insect-damaged plants function as attractants and affect the behavior of the natural enemies of herbivorous insects. They also display diverse effects on insect behaviors and are also used as foraging cues by parasitoids and predators. After damaged by phytophagous insects, some host plants could attract parasitoids and predators as an indirect defense. They can also induce defense responses in adjacent plants. Trees of some species are reported to produce volatile signals that affect the behavior of natural enemies. A summary on the recent trends published since 2000 to date on the plant volatiles in relation to insect natural enemies was specified. The use of plant volatiles in integrated pest management programs was also discussed.},

Moreover, exogenous application of JA can be used to elicit plant defence responses similar to those induced by biting-chewing herbivores and mites that pierce cells and consume their contents. In the present study, we used Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) plants to explore how application of a low dose of JA followed by minor herbivory by spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) affects transcript levels of P. lunatus (E)-β-ocimene synthase (PlOS), emission of (E)-β-ocimene and nine other plant volatiles commonly associated with herbivory. Furthermore, we investigated the plant’s phytohormonal response. Application of a low dose of JA increased PlOS transcript levels in a synergistic manner when followed by minor herbivory for both simultaneous and sequential infestation. Emission of (E)-β-ocimene was also increased, and only JA, but not SA, levels were affected by treatments. Projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of other volatiles showed overlap between treatments. Thus, a low-dose JA application results in a synergistic effect on gene transcription and an increased emission of a volatile compound involved in indirect defence after herbivore infestation.},

	abstract = {In ecosystems, plants are continuously challenged by combined stress conditions more than by a single biotic or abiotic factor. Consequently, in recent years studies on plant relationships with multiple stresses have aroused increasing interest. Here, the impact of inoculation with fungal pathogens with different lifestyles on Arabidopsis plants response to the following infestation with the invasive crop pest Eurydema oleracea was investigated. In particular, as fungal pathogens the necrotroph Botrytis cinerea and the biotroph Golovinomyces orontii were used. Plants exposed to B. cinerea, but not to G. orontii, showed reduced herbivore feeding damage. This difference was associated to different hormonal pathways triggered by the pathogens: G. orontii only induced the salicylate-mediated pathway, while B. cinerea stimulated also the jasmonate-dependent signalling, which persisted for a long time providing a long-term defence to further herbivore attack. In particular, the lower susceptibility of B. cinerea-infected Arabidopsis plants to E. oleracea was related to the stimulation of the JA-induced pathway on the production of plant volatile compounds, since treatment with VOCs emitted by B. cinerea inoculated plants inhibited both insect plant choice and feeding damage. These results indicate that necrotrophic plant pathogenic fungi modulate host volatile emission, thus affecting plant response to subsequent insect, thereby increasing the knowledge on tripartite plant–microbe–insect interactions in nature.},

Four non-host herbivore species were tested: the caterpillars Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) and Spodoptera exigua (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), both chewing insects, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae (Koch) (Acari: Tetranychidae), which punctures parenchymal cells, and the aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphidoidea), which is a phloem-feeder. Compared with undamaged plants, C. rubecula females were more attracted to Arabidopsis plants infested by P. rapae, P. xylostella, S. exigua, or T. urticae, but not to plants infested by M. persicae. The parasitoids preferred host-infested plants to spider mite- or aphid-infested plants, but not to plants infested with non-host caterpillars (P. xylostella or S. exigua). The data show that when Arabidopsis plants are infested with a leaf tissue-damaging herbivore they emit a volatile blend that attracts C. rubecula females and the wasps only discriminate between a host and non-host herbivore when the type of damage is different (chewing vs. piercing). When Arabidopsis is infested with a herbivore that hardly damages leaf tissue, C. rubecula females are not attracted. These results may be explained by differences in the amount of damage and in the relative importance of different signal-transduction pathways induced by different types of herbivores.},

In greenhouse crops, several entomophagous species (predators and parasitoids) are used simultaneously in the crop cycle. One important aspect of these crops, which represent modified ecosystems, is the interactions among complexes of species, including plants, phytophagous insects, and predators. The chemical relationships (semiochemicals: pheromones and kairomones) among these species likely play an important role in greenhouse crops; however, few studies have focused on these relationships. The aim of this study was to analyse the importance of semiochemicals. Three groups of laboratory trials were conducted with two predatory species: Nabis pseudoferus and Nesidiocoris tenuis (Hemiptera: Nabidae and Miridae, respectively). The results of the first group of trials indicated that the adult females of both species were more attracted to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) than they were to the control plants or plants with artificial damage. Based on the second group of trials, pheromones triggered an attraction in adult females of both species for conspecifics. Finally, based on the interactions of the adult females of the same species, pheromones changed or modulated the predatory responses to HIPVs. The implications of these results for the biological control of pest species in greenhouses are further discussed.},

	abstract = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 643–656 Abstract Plants have evolved a range of strategies to manipulate the behaviour of their insect partners. One powerful strategy is to produce signals that already have a role in the animals’ own communication systems. To investigate to what extent the evolution of floral scents is correlated with chemical communication in insects, I analyse the occurrence, commonness, and evolutionary patterns of the 71 most common ‘floral’ volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in 96 plant families and 87 insect families. I found an overlap of 87\% in VOCs produced by plants and insects. ‘Floral’ monoterpenes showed strong positive correlation in commonness between plants (both gymnosperms and angiosperms) and herbivores, whereas the commonness of ‘floral’ aromatics was positively correlated between angiosperms and both pollinators and herbivores. According to a multivariate regression analysis the commonness of ‘floral’ aromatics was best explained by their commonness in pollinators, whereas monoterpenes were best explained by herbivores. Among pollinator orders, aromatics were significantly more common in Lepidoptera than in Hymenoptera, whereas monoterpenes showed no difference among the two orders. Collectively, these patterns suggest that plants and insects converge in overall patterns of volatile production, both for attraction and defence. Monoterpenes seem to have evolved primarily for defence under selection by herbivores, whereas aromatics evolved signalling functions in angiosperms, primarily for pollinator attraction.},

	abstract = {Herbivore-induced plant volatiles constitute the first indicators of insect host presence, and these can affect the foraging behavior of their natural enemies. The density of insect hosts may affect the nature and concentration of these plant-induced volatiles. We tested the impact of infestation density (low, intermediate, and high) of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Homoptera: Aphididae), feeding on the broad bean Vicia faba, on the attractiveness of the parasitoid Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), using a Y-tube olfactometer (infested vs. non-infested plants). The emitted volatile compounds from both infested and non-infested plants were collected and identified. In addition, two series of experiments were carried out to test the impact of the presence of a conspecific female parasitoid within the aphid/plant complex on the attractiveness to other females. Parasitoids were significantly more attracted to the plants with low and intermediate aphid infestation levels. The volatile blend composition of the infested plants changed in relation to aphid density and may explain the low attraction of parasitoids toward high aphid density. The presence of conspecific females on the aphid patch had no apparent impact on the behavioral choices of other parasitoid females. Our study adds a new aspect to understanding plant–aphid–parasitoid interactions, including the possibility that aphids may manipulate chemical cues of host plants affecting the orientation of parasitoids.},

	abstract = {Plants release unique blends of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) into the atmosphere, part of a silent language used to communicate with other organisms in their community. Within this high traffic chemical environment, plants and insects, among other organisms, are receiving, processing, modifying, and responding to information conveyed through varying suites of molecules. Because plants and insects are part of an integrative complex of food web relationships, one common topic of conversation is defence. Plants maintain a baseline level of BVOC emissions as a bottom-up constitutive defence, emitting compounds that act as repellents or deterrents to feeding and/or egg deposition by herbivores. Due to the autonomy of their attackers, plants can also employ an indirect top-down defence strategy, releasing induced volatiles in response to feeding that attract the natural enemies of their herbivore attackers, such as predators and parasitoids. Both bottom-up and top-down BVOC-mediated strategies have important consequences for herbivore preference, performance, and survival with even broader ecological and evolutionary consequences for tritrophic interactions. In this chapter we discuss how constitutive BVOCs mediate aspects of plant defence within a hierarchical spatiotemporal framework. Next we bring to light some of the most recent research on oviposition- and herbivore-induced BVOC synthesis and subsequent effects on the recruitment of natural enemies. We follow up by discussing the ecological effects of induced BVOCs in the context of multiple herbivores, expression from various plant organs, time-lags associated with BVOC induction, and heterogeneity within the infochemical environment. The critical feature of insect learning is described and we highlight some of the major evolutionary implications of BVOC-mediated plant defence syndromes that rely on the unique timing of events at the biochemical, atmospheric, organismal, and community scales.},

	abstract = {Eavesdropping, the interception of signals by unintended receivers, is an important component of the ecology and evolution of communication systems. Plants and microbes have complex communication systems with important consequences for agriculture, human health, and ecosystem functioning. Eavesdropping, however, has mostly been studied in animal systems. In this review, we argue that eavesdropping is an important force shaping the ecology and evolution of communication in these non-animal systems. To date, studying eavesdropping in plants and microbes has been limited by the fact that signaler “intention” is often unclear: distinguishing signals that evolved to convey information from unintended cues is particularly difficult in plants and microbes, and the fitness consequences of signaling are rarely measured. We describe some of the main examples of eavesdropping in plant and microbial communication and point out other murkier cases were the molecular and physiological basis of communication are well-understood, but the evolutionary implications have not been addressed. We argue that these systems provide experimental tractability to test some of the predicted ecological and evolutionary consequences of eavesdropping, and that the particularities of these systems can lead to an increased understanding of eavesdropping, and its importance in biological communication.},

	abstract = {Plants are at the trophic base of most ecosystems, embedded in a rich network of ecological interactions in which they evolved. While their limited range and speed of motion precludes animal-typical behavior, plants are accomplished chemists, producing thousands of specialized metabolites which may function to convey information, or even to manipulate the physiology of other organisms. Plants’ complex interactions and their underlying mechanisms are typically dissected within the controlled environments of growth chambers and glasshouses, but doing so introduces conditions alien to plants evolved in natural environments, such as being pot-bound, and receiving artificial light with a spectrum very different from sunlight. The mechanistic understanding gained from a reductionist approach provides the tools required to query and manipulate plant interactions in real-world settings. The few tests conducted in natural ecosystems and agricultural fields have highlighted the limitations of studying plant interactions only in artificial environments. Here, we focus on three examples of known or hypothesized chemical mediators of plants’ interactions: the volatile phytohormone ethylene (ET), more complex plant volatile blends, and as-yet-unknown mediators transferred by common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). We highlight how mechanistic knowledge has advanced research in all three areas, and the critical importance of field work if we are to put our understanding of chemical ecology on rigorous experimental and theoretical footing, and demonstrate function.},

	abstract = {Plants produce distinct blends of volatile compounds that attract pollinators (floral odors) or natural enemies of insect herbivores (herbivore-induced plant volatiles). The admixture of these blends in the atmosphere may alter the attraction of insect mutualists and ultimately affect plant fitness. Here, using synthetic blends of Brassica rapa floral volatiles and real B. rapa flowers, we investigated how floral odors impact the foraging behavior of parasitoids. In an olfactometer setting, floral odors reduced the attractiveness of plants infested by herbivores to parasitoids by 43.5\% and affected four out of five parasitoid species tested. Additionally, experiments with the parasitoid Cotesia glomerata revealed that the effects of floral odors are dose-dependent and that floral odors were less disruptive under wind tunnel conditions than under olfactometer conditions. Electroantennogram recordings showed that C. glomerata antennae do respond to floral compounds, but that floral compounds do not inhibit antennal responses to herbivore-induced leaf volatiles. In conclusion, floral odors can act as background pollutants decreasing the attractiveness of chemical blends used by natural enemies to locate their hosts. Under natural conditions, such interferences could affect the outcome of tritrophic interactions and may play an important role in the evolution of plant volatile signaling.},

However, the whole-genome transcriptional responses of treated plants remain unknown, and the signal pathways that produce HIPVs are also unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings Time course patterns of the gene expression of Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to Lima bean volatiles were examined using Affymetrix ATH1 genome arrays. Results showed that A. thaliana received and responded to leafminer-induced volatiles from Lima beans through up-regulation of genes related to the ethylene (ET) and jasmonic acid pathways. Time course analysis revealed strong and partly qualitative differences in the responses between exposure at 24 and that at 48 h. Further experiments using either A. thaliana ET mutant ein2-1 or A. thaliana jasmonic acid mutant coi1-2 indicated that both pathways are involved in the volatile response process but that the ET pathway is indispensable for detecting volatiles. Moreover, transcriptional comparisons showed that plant responses to larval feeding do not merely magnify the volatile response process. Finally, (Z)-3-hexen-ol, ocimene, (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, and (3E,7E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene triggered responses in A. thaliana similar to those induced by the entire suite of Lima bean volatiles after 24 and 48 h. Conclusions/Significance This study shows that the transcriptional responses of plants to HIPVs become stronger as treatment time increases and that ET signals are critical during this process.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the behavioural responses of Polybia fastidiosuscula Saussure (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) to volatiles from maize, both constitutive volatiles and those induced by the herbivory of Spodoptera frugiperda (JE Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). To assess the behavioural response of P. fastidiosuscula to S. frugiperda larvae, undamaged plants, S. frugiperda-damaged plants, mechanically damaged plants, mechanically damaged plants plus regurgitant from larvae and extracts from various treatments, bioassays were conducted in a Y-olfactometer. In addition, the volatiles from plants subjected to different treatments were collected via aeration, and they were quantified and identified. The wasps showed a greater preference for plants with damage induced either by larval feeding or by being mechanically damaged plus regurgitant than for undamaged plants or either larvae alone or mechanically damaged plants. Wasps were more attracted to extracts from plants + S. frugiperda larvae and to an extract from mechanically damaged plants + the regurgitant of larvae compared to hexane. The primary compounds induced by herbivory for 5–6 h after the beginning of the damage or regurgitant treatment were identified as α-pinene, β-myrcene, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, limonene, (E)-ocimene, linalool, DMNT, (E)-β-farnesene, TMTT and indole.

	abstract = {Extensive research has been conducted to reveal how species diversity affects ecosystem functions and services. Yet, consequences of diversity loss for ecosystems as a whole as well as for single community members are still difficult to predict. Arthropod communities typically are species-rich, and their species interactions, such as those between herbivores and their predators or parasitoids, may be particularly sensitive to changes in community composition. Parasitoids forage for herbivorous hosts by using herbivore-induced plant volatiles (indirect cues) and cues produced by their host (direct cues). However, in addition to hosts, non-suitable herbivores are present in a parasitoid's environment which may complicate the foraging process for the parasitoid. Therefore, ecosystem changes in the diversity of herbivores may affect the foraging efficiency of parasitoids. The effect of herbivore diversity may be mediated by either species numbers per se, by specific species traits, or by both. To investigate how diversity and identity of non-host herbivores influence the behaviour of parasitoids, we created environments with different levels of non-host diversity. On individual plants in these environments, we complemented host herbivores with 1–4 non-host herbivore species. We subsequently studied the behaviour of the gregarious endoparasitoid Cotesia glomerata L. (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) while foraging for its gregarious host Pieris brassicae L. (Lepidoptera: Pieridae). Neither non-host species diversity nor non-host identity influenced the preference of the parasitoid for herbivore-infested plants. However, after landing on the plant, non-host species identity did affect parasitoid behaviour, whereas non-host diversity did not. One of the non-host species, Trichoplusia ni Hübner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), reduced the time the parasitoid spent on the plant as well as the number of hosts it parasitized. We conclude that non-host herbivore species identity has a larger influence on C. glomerata foraging behaviour than non-host species diversity. Our study shows the importance of species identity over species diversity in a multitrophic interaction of plants, herbivores, and parasitoids.},

	url = {https://repository.nwu.ac.za/handle/10394/26870},
	abstract = {Maize is the most widely grown cereal crop worldwide, and is the most important staple crop 
in sub-Sahara Africa. The spotted stemborer, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: 
Crambidae) is considered among the most important pests of maize and the damage it causes 
may result in yield losses of up to 88\%. Previous studies showed that plants damaged by 
herbivores release huge amounts of volatile compounds, known as herbivore-induced plant 
volatiles (HIPVs) into the environment, which serve as attractant to natural enemies and 
repellent to herbivores. In addition, emitted HlPVs affect the defence responses of 
neighbouring plants. Previous studies reported that the non-host molasses grass, Melinis 
minutiflora P. Beauv. repels C. partellus moths and increases larval parasitism by Cotesia 
sesamiae Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) when intercropped with maize. However, the 
potential role of plant signalling between molasses grass and maize, and any subsequent 
effect on C. partellus and C. sesamiae behaviour remained unknown. Moreover, it was not 
known for how long the maize plant retained the information after removal from exposure to 
the emitter plant. Experiments were conducted by exposing plants of two maize landraces, 
"Nyamula" and "Jowi-red", and two hybrid maize varieties "WS505" and "PH4" to molasses 
grass volatiles for certain periods of time. In two-choice oviposition bioassays, gravid C. 
partellus moths preferred non-exposed maize landraces for oviposition compared to those 
exposed to molasses grass volatiles. Additionally, volatile samples collected from landrace 
maize plants were significantly more attractive to C. sesamiae compared to non-exposed 
maize plants in four-arm olfactometer bioassays. Similarly, maize plants previously exposed 
to molasses grass and removed for certain periods of time then infested by C. partellus larvae 
were not preferred for ovipostion by C. partellus moths, and headspace samples collected 
were more attractive to C. sesamiae comparared to non-exposed infested plants. Headspace 
samples were analysed using Gas Chromatography (GC), Coupled Gas Chromatography-Mass 
Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Gas Chromatography-Electroantennography (GC-EAG). 
GC-EAG analysis with attractive headspace samples from exposed maize landraces revealed 
that C. sesamiae was responsive to certain compounds, namely, myrcene, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol 
acetate, (E)-ocimene, (ᵝ)-ocimene, (R)-linanool, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-l ,3, 7-nonatriene (DMNT), 
decanal, (E)-caryophyllene and (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene (TMTT). 
Notably, with the commercial maize hybrids, there was no significant difference in the 
number of eggs laid by C. partellus moths on exposed and non-exposed plants. Similarly, 
there was no significant difference in C. sesamiae attraction towards volatiles obtained from 
exposed and non exposed hybrid maize plants. These findings suggest that volatile organic 
compounds released by molasses grass have the ability to induce defence responses in

Plant metabolomics approach plays a key role in the identification of chemical mediators involved in these two types of interactions. Metabolomics is a useful tool for the characterization of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) involved in plant-insect interactions, or for the bioguided identification of active compounds from new raw materials. On the other hand, metabolomics approach can be used for the characterization of metabolic pathways affected by plant priming, biostimulant or elicitor application and/or for mechanistic study of Plant-PGPR (Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria) interaction through biomarker specific metabolic fingerprint study.},

Little is known about the genetic variability in such herbivore-induced plant signals and about how the emissions in cultivated plants compare to those of their wild relatives. For this reason we compared the total quantity and the qualitative composition of the odour blend among eleven maize cultivars and five wild Zea (Poaceae) species (teosinte), as well as among the offspring of eight Zea mays mexicana plants from a single population. Young plants were induced to release volatiles by mechanically damaging the leaves and applying oral secretions of Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) caterpillars to the wounded sites. Volatiles were collected 7 h after treatment and subsequently analysed by gas chromatography. The total amounts of volatiles released were significantly different among maize cultivars as well as among the teosintes. Moreover, striking differences were found in the composition of the induced odour blends. Caryophyllene, for instance, was released by some, but not all varieties and teosintes, and the ratios among monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes varied considerably. The offspring of different mother plants of the Z. m. mexicana population showed some variation in the total amounts that they released, but the composition of the odour blend was very consistent within the population of this teosinte species. We discuss the ecological significance of these findings in terms of specificity and reliability of induced plant signals for parasitoids.},

Here, we show that mycorrhizal mycelia can also act as a conduit for signalling between plants, acting as an early warning system for herbivore attack. Insect herbivory causes systemic changes in the production of plant volatiles, particularly methyl salicylate, making bean plants, Vicia faba, repellent to aphids but attractive to aphid enemies such as parasitoids. We demonstrate that these effects can also occur in aphid-free plants but only when they are connected to aphid-infested plants via a common mycorrhizal mycelial network. This underground messaging system allows neighbouring plants to invoke herbivore defences before attack. Our findings demonstrate that common mycorrhizal mycelial networks can determine the outcome of multitrophic interactions by communicating information on herbivore attack between plants, thereby influencing the behaviour of both herbivores and their natural enemies.},

	abstract = {Heavy metals are important pollutants that can severely impact ecological foodwebs. In addition to direct toxic effects, these contaminants have been suggested to disrupt chemical communication channels between plants and insects that rely on volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We investigated how different concentrations of copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) stress affect the capacity of Zea mays to synthesize VOCs in the presence and absence of herbivorous insects. Hydroponically grown maize exposed to a high and low concentration of either Cu or Cd showed stunted growth and lower photosynthetic capacities. Herbivores feeding on stressed plants also had attenuated growth rates. Heavy metal treatment alone did not induce VOC emission in maize plants; however, the higher Cu dose was found to prime for enhanced volatile production that can be triggered by caterpillar feeding. Cu stress correlated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species in roots and priming of herbivore-induced jasmonic acid in leaves. Plants challenged with Cd and herbivory did not differ in responses compared with herbivore-damaged controls with no heavy metals added to the substrate. For Cu stress, our results support the ‘single biochemical mechanism for multiple stressors’ model which predicts overlapping signalling and responses to abiotic and biotic stress factors.},

	abstract = {Studies on aboveground (AG) plant organs have shown that volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions differ between simultaneous attack by herbivores and single herbivore attack. There is growing evidence that interactive effects of simultaneous herbivory also occur across the root-shoot interface. In our study, Brassica rapa roots were infested with root fly larvae (Delia radicum) and the shoots infested with Pieris brassicae, either singly or simultaneously, to study these root-shoot interactions. As an analytical platform, we used Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) to investigate VOCs over a 3 day time period. Our set-up allowed us to monitor root and shoot emissions concurrently on the same plant. Focus was placed on the sulfur-containing compounds; methanethiol, dimethylsulfide (DMS), and dimethyldisulfide (DMDS), because these compounds previously have been shown to be biologically active in the interactions of Brassica plants, herbivores, parasitoids, and predators, yet have received relatively little attention. The shoots of plants simultaneously infested with AG and belowground (BG) herbivores emitted higher levels of sulfur-containing compounds than plants with a single herbivore species present. In contrast, the emission of sulfur VOCs from the plant roots increased as a consequence of root herbivory, independent of the presence of an AG herbivore. The onset of root emissions was more rapid after damage than the onset of shoot emissions. The shoots of double infested plants also emitted higher levels of methanol. Thus, interactive effects of root and shoot herbivores exhibit more strongly in the VOC emissions from the shoots than from the roots, implying the involvement of specific signaling interactions.},

	abstract = {Root herbivores are notoriously difficult to study, as they feed hidden in the soil. However, root herbivores may be traced by analyzing specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are produced by damaged roots. These VOCs not only support parasitoids in the localization of their host, but also may help scientists study belowground plant-herbivore interactions. Herbivore-induced VOCs are usually analyzed by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), but with this off-line method, the gases of interest need to be preconcentrated, and destructive sampling is required to assess the level of damage to the roots. In contrast to this, proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) is a very sensitive on-line, non-invasive method. PTR-MS already has been successfully applied to analyze VOCs produced by aboveground (infested) plant parts. In this review, we provide a brief overview of PTR-MS and illustrate how this technology can be applied to detect specific root-herbivore induced VOCs from Brassica plants. We also specify the advantages and disadvantages of PTR-MS analyses and new technological developments to overcome their limitations.},

	abstract = {Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are tiny parasitic worms that parasitize insects, in which they reproduce. Their foraging behavior has been subject to numerous studies, most of which have proposed that, at short distances, EPNs use chemicals that are emitted directly from the host as host location cues. Carbon dioxide (CO2) in particular has been implicated as an important cue. Recent evidence shows that at longer distances several EPNs take advantage of volatiles that are specifically emitted by roots in response to insect attack. Studies that have revealed these plant-mediated interactions among three trophic levels have been met with some disbelief.},

This sesquiterpene, which is not found in healthy maize roots, attracts the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis megidis. In sharp contrast to the emission of virtually only this single compound by damaged roots, maize leaves emit a blend of numerous volatile organic compounds in response to herbivory. To try to explain this difference between roots and leaves, we studied the diffusion properties of various maize volatiles in sand and soil. The best diffusing compounds were found to be terpenes. Only one other sesquiterpene known for maize, α-copaene, diffused better than (E)-β-caryophyllene, but biosynthesis of the former is far more costly for the plant than the latter. The diffusion of (E)-β-caryophyllene occurs through the gaseous rather than the aqueous phase, as it was found to diffuse faster and further at low moisture level. However, a water layer is needed to prevent complete loss through vertical diffusion, as was found for totally dry sand. Hence, it appears that maize has adapted to emit a readily diffusing and cost-effective belowground signal from its insect-damaged roots.},

Frequently changing climatic conditions can cause recurring droughts which often subject plants to tremendous amounts of stress, leaving biologists to wonder about its impact on the associated herbivores and their interactions with host plants. 2. The present study was aimed at assessing the impact of low moisture stress on herbivore-plant interactions using tomato and its associated herbivores (leaf miner, Tuta absoluta and sap feeder, Bemisia tabaci). 3. The leaf miner T. absoluta preferred tomato plants exposed to moderate drought stress compared to severely drought stressed or healthy plants while the sap feeder B. tabaci preferred healthy tomato plants that were irrigated regularly over others. Our study uncovers few intriguing aspects of low moisture stress on herbivore-host interactions and also highlights that this influence may vary depending upon the herbivore feeding guild. 4. The volatile profiles of tomato plants were found to differ significantly when subjected to varied degrees of low moisture stress. Such changes in plant's volatile emissions may in turn alter its associated herbivore's behavioural perspective as observed in T. absoluta and B. tabaci. 5. Reduced amounts of caryophyllene, humulene, 3-carene, myristic acid, and γ-butyl-γ-butyrolactone might be what aids T. absoluta and B. tabaci in gauging the drought stress status of a host plant. Further, the presence of chemical cues such as α-pinene, m-cymene, and ethyl benzaldehyde might signal T. absoluta moths of severely stressed plants. Similarly, the presence of undecane, ethyl benzaldehyde, n-hexadecanoic acid might aid whiteflies in identifying plants reeling under low moisture stress.},

An effective strategy used in developing pest controlling agents is the synergism between insect pheromones and host plant volatiles, which can increase the attraction of insect pest. The present study was aimed at investigating the chemical constituents and attractant effects of the volatiles extracted from different parts of the host plant brinjal on the behavior of adult L. orbonalis. Bioassay using Y-shaped olfactometer revealed that the one-day old virgin female, gravid female and male insects respond positively to the host plant volatiles extracted from fruits, leaves and shoots but not to that of flowers. It was shown that the gravid females were significantly attracted to all three volatiles (p {\textless} 0.05). Bioassay using X-shaped olfactometer identified that all three types of insects highly preferred the volatiles from fruits (p {\textless} 0.05). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of volatiles indicated that brinjal plant produces volatile secondary metabolites, which include 2,2′-(Ethane-1,2-diylbis(oxy))bis(ethane-2,1-diyl) dibenzoate (12.11\%), 3,7-dimethylocta-1,6-dien-3-ol (22.38\%), Benzyl alcohol (22.9\%) and Benzyl alcohol (27.06\%) as major constituents from fruits, shoots, leaves and flowers respectively. Responses of insects to the volatiles from host plant in the absence of visual cues direct us to focus on the importance of host plant volatiles to locate the plant. Results of this study emphasize the major role that host plant volatiles play in the attraction of insect pests towards the plant.},

We characterized the changes in the floral emissions of Diplotaxis erucoides induced by folivory and florivory by Pieris brassicae. Plants were continually subjected to folivory, florivory and folivory + florivory treatments for two days. We measured floral emissions with proton transfer reaction/mass spectroscopy (PTR-MS) at different times during the application of the treatments. The emissions of methanol, ethyl acetate and another compound, likely 3-butenenitrile, increased significantly in response to florivory. Methanol and 3-butenenitrile increased 2.4- and 26-fold, respectively, in response to the florivory treatment. Methanol, 3-butenenitrile and ethyl acetate increased 3-, 100- and 9-fold, respectively, in response to the folivory + florivory treatment. Folivory alone had no detectable effect on floral emissions. All VOC emissions began immediately after attack, with no evidence of delayed induction in any of the treatments. Folivory and florivory had a synergistic effect when applied together, which strengthened the defensive response when the attack was extended to the entire plant.},

Volatiles have also been demonstrated to protect plants by attracting herbivore enemies, such as parasitic wasps, predatory arthropods and possibly even insectivorous birds. Even below ground herbivory results in the release of volatiles that attract herbivore enemies. However, plant volatiles are also known to attract enemies of plants.

In nature, plants are often attacked by multiple herbivores, but the majority of studies which have investigated indirect plant defenses to date have focused on the recruitment of different parasitoid species in a single-herbivore context. Here, we report our investigation on the attraction of egg parasitoids of lepidopteran hosts (Trichogramma brassicae and T. evanescens) toward plant volatiles induced by different insect herbivores in olfactometer bioassays. We used a system consisting of a native crucifer, Brassica nigra, two naturally associated herbivores [the butterfly Pieris brassicae (eggs and caterpillars) and the aphid Brevicoryne brassicae] and an alien invasive herbivore (eggs and caterpillars of the moth Spodoptera exigua). We found that Trichogramma wasps were attracted by volatiles induced in the plants by P. brassicae eggs, but not by those induced in the plants by S. exigua eggs, indicating the specificity of the plant responses toward lepidopteran herbivores. The results of the chemical analysis revealed significant differences between the volatile blends emitted by plants in response to attack by P. brassicae and S. exigua eggs which were in agreement with the behavioural observations. We investigated the attraction of Trichogramma wasps toward P. brassicae egg-induced volatiles in plants simultaneously attacked by larvae and nymphs of different non-hosts. The two chewing caterpillars P. brassicae and S. exigua, but not the phloem-feeding aphid B. brassicae, can disrupt the attraction of Trichogramma species toward P. brassicae egg-induced volatiles. Indirect plant defenses are discussed in the context of multiple herbivory by evaluating the importance of origin, dietary specialization and feeding guild of different attackers on the recruitment of egg-killing parasitoids.},

However, emission models do not currently have a quantitative description of plant volatile emission rates during and after insect herbivore feeding. This review provides a brief background on plant volatile organic compounds, the urgency of including biotic stress emissions in models, and a summary of plant volatile emission models and steps they have taken to incorporate stress emissions into their framework. The review ends with a synthesis of volatile emissions from trees during insect herbivory. This synthesis highlights key gaps in studied systems and measurement approaches.

	abstract = {Volatile compounds (scents) play an important role in mediating ecological interactions between plants and other organisms, including defence against biotic and abiotic stressors, such as herbivory or physical damage. Seed plants respond to wounding and herbivory by changing their volatile emissions and producing complex blends of compounds; this process is mediated by the phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA) that acts as a signalling molecule activating plant defence pathways. Exogenous application of JA can mimic the plant’s responses to herbivory and is used in agriculture to enhance plant defences. Although this phenomenon has been well documented for seed plants, our knowledge on non-seed plants is scarce, leading to question whether the observed patterns are ubiquitous to all vascular plant species. This study aimed to characterise the volatile emissions of six native New Zealand fern species (Cyathea dealbata, Cyathea medullaris, Dicksonia squarrosa, Asplenium bulbiferum, Asplenium oblongifolium, and Microsorum pustulatum), and explore their changes in response to physical damage, exogenous application of JA, and herbivory. Physical damage caused a significant increase in volatile emissions, with odour blends dominated by green leaf volatiles (as observed in seed plants); whereas JA application only caused a moderate increase in volatile release and (unlike seed plants) did not produce a substantial increase in terpenoid emission. Compounds (E)-2-hexene and (E)-2-pentenol were unique to the headspace of herbivore-damaged plants, indicating that ferns may have specific responses to herbivory. This work suggests that changes in volatile emissions are common responses to biotic and abiotic stress in vascular plants, but prompts further research to elucidate the signalling and regulatory mechanisms in ferns.},

	abstract = {Plants are primary food sources for many organisms and therefore require effective defense mechanisms. Some plants produce defense compounds such as toxic alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolic compounds, or saponins which instantly act against herbivore attack (constitutive defense). Also mechanical barriers, sticky secretions, a pungent, bitter taste, or extreme pH may deter the organisms immediately from feeding. Instead, some plants upregulate their defense mechanisms only after provocation (induced defense). A complex recognition and signaling system including jasmonic acid and salicylate ensures an adequate response. Induced defense has the drawback that some time passes from recognition to defense, yet if not attacked all resources can be invested in growth. The production of toxins (phytoalexins) or proteinase inhibitors is dramatically increased. Together with nutrient allocation, the latter contribute to lowering of the feeding success of herbivores. Included in the induced defense is the production of volatiles in order to warn neighboring plants as well as to attract help from predatory insects. Besides, the nectar flow of extrafloral nectaries is induced providing a reward to insects that remove herbivores. As a third general strategy, some plants release highly reactive toxins quickly by enzymatic activation from inactive storage forms such as benzoxazinoids, iridoids, cyanogenic glycosides, or glucosinolates (activated defense).},

	abstract = {Natural and managed ecosystems are undergoing rapid environmental change due to a growing human population and associated increases in industrial and agricultural activity. Global environmental change directly and indirectly impacts insect herbivores and pollinators. In this review, we highlight recent research examining how environmental change factors affect plant chemistry and, in turn, ecological interactions among plants, herbivores, and pollinators. Recent studies reveal the complex nature of understanding global change effects on plant secondary metabolites and plant–insect interactions. Nonetheless, these studies indicate that phytochemistry mediates insect responses to environmental change. Future research on the chemical ecology of plant–insect interactions will provide critical insight into the ecological effects of climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances. We recommend greater attention to investigations examining interactive effects of multiple environmental change factors in addition to chemically mediated plant–pollinator interactions, given limited research in these areas.},

	abstract = {In response to insect attack, plants release complex blends of volatile compounds. These volatiles serve as foraging cues for herbivores, predators and parasitoids, leading to plant-mediated interactions within and between trophic levels. Hence, plant volatiles may be important determinants of insect community composition. To test this, we created rice lines that are impaired in the emission of two major signals, S-linalool and (E)-β-caryophyllene. We found that inducible S-linalool attracted predators and parasitoids as well as chewing herbivores, but repelled the rice brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a major pest. The constitutively produced (E)-β-caryophyllene on the other hand attracted both parasitoids and planthoppers, resulting in an increased herbivore load. Thus, silencing either signal resulted in specific insect assemblages in the field, highlighting the importance of plant volatiles in determining insect community structures. Moreover, the results imply that the manipulation of volatile emissions in crops has great potential for the control of pest populations.},

	abstract = {There are myriad ways in which pollinators and herbivores can interact via the evolutionary and behavioural responses of their host plants. 2. Given that both herbivores and pollinators consume and are dependent upon plant-derived nutrients and secondary metabolites, and utilize plant signals, plant chemistry should be one of the major factors mediating these interactions. 3. Here we build upon a conceptual framework for understanding plant-mediated interactions of pollinators and herbivores. We focus on plant chemistry, in particular plant volatiles and aim to unify hypotheses for plant defence and pollination. We make predictions for the evolutionary outcomes of these interactions by hypothesizing that conflicting selection pressures from herbivores and pollinators arise from the constraints imposed by plant chemistry. 4. We further hypothesize that plants could avoid conflicts between pollinator attraction and herbivore defence through tissue-specific regulation of pollinator reward chemistry, as well as herbivore-induced changes in flower chemistry and morphology. 5. Finally, we test aspects of our predictions in a case study using a wild tomato species, Solanum peruvianum, to illustrate the diversity of tissue-specific and herbivore-induced differences in plant chemistry that could influence herbivore and pollinator behaviour, and plant fitness. © 2009 British Ecological Society.},

	abstract = {Maize plants respond to feeding by arthropod herbivores by producing a number of secondary plant compounds, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These herbivore-induced VOCs are not only known to attract natural enemies of the herbivores, but they may also prime inducible defences in neighbouring plants, resulting in stronger and faster defence responses in these VOC-exposed plants. Among the compounds that cause this priming effect, green leaf volatiles (GLVs) have received particular attention, as they are ubiquitous and rapidly emitted upon damage. In this study, we investigated their effects under realistic conditions by applying specially devised dispensers to release four synthetic GLVs at physiologically relevant concentrations in a series of experiments in maize fields. We compared the VOC emission of GLV-exposed maize plants to non-exposed plants and monitored the attraction of herbivores and predators, as well as parasitism of the caterpillar Spodoptera frugiperda, the most common herbivore in the experimental maize fields. We found that maize plants that were exposed to GLVs emitted increased quantities of sesquiterpenes compared to non-exposed plants. In several replicates, herbivorous insects, such as adult Diabrotica beetles and S. frugiperda larvae, were observed more frequently in GLV-treated plots and caused more damage to GLV-exposed plants than to non-exposed plants. Parasitism of S. frugiperda was only weakly affected by GLVs and overall parasitism rates of S. frugiperda were similar in GLV-exposed and non-exposed plots. The effects on insect presence depended on the distance from the GLV-dispensers at which the plants were located. The results are discussed in the context of strategies to improve biological control by enhancing plant-mediated attraction of natural enemies.},

However, there is a paucity of studies on its behavioral ecology in relation to herbivore induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). An attempt was made to study behaviour of T. tabaci towards HIPVs and healthy plant volatiles. Olfactometer bioassays revealed that T. tabaci significantly preferred HIPVs from conspecific infested onion to volatiles from healthy onion plants. Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of HIPVs and volatiles from healthy onion plants revealed substantial changes in their volatile profiles. Our study provides empirical data on signals HIPVs may provide herbivores and suggests that the role of HIPVs, mostly generalized as defense, may vary based on the interaction and must be studied closely to understand their ecological roles. It also provides basis for the development of kairomone based management strategies against this devastating pest.},

Here, we examine how systemically produced plant volatiles, in response to local herbivore damage, differentially attract a key omnivorous predator, Anthocoris nemorum (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae), to single clones of three species of Salix: S. viminalis, S. dasyclados and S. cinerea. The profiles of the plant volatiles produced were found to vary among Salix clones and between herbivore-damaged and intact plants. Anthocoris nemorum was attracted to the volatiles released from undamaged plants of all three species, but most strongly to a native S. cinerea clone. Plants damaged by the herbivorous leaf beetle Phratora vulgatissima (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) were generally more attractive than undamaged plants, with A. nemorum responding to systemic changes in the damaged plants where the experimental design specifically excluded volatiles released from the actual site of damage. When comparing damaged plants, the S. dasyclados clone was more attractive to A. nemorum than the S. viminalis clone—a somewhat surprising result since this Salix clone is considered relatively resistant to P. vulgatissima, and hence offers a limited amount of prey. Our experiments highlight that both constitutive and induced plant volatiles play a role in omnivore attraction, and this emphasizes the importance of considering odours of released volatiles when cropping and breeding Salix for increased resistance to herbivores.},
