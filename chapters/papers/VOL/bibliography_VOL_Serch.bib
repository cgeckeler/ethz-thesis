	abstract = {The protection and restoration of the biosphere is crucial for human resilience and well-being, but the scarcity of data on the status and distribution of biodiversity puts these efforts at risk. DNA released into the environment by organisms, i.e., environmental DNA (eDNA), can be used to monitor biodiversity in a scalable manner if equipped with the appropriate tool. However, the collection of eDNA in terrestrial environments remains a challenge because of the many potential surfaces and sources that need to be surveyed and their limited accessibility. Here, we propose to survey biodiversity by sampling eDNA on the outer branches of tree canopies with an aerial robot. The drone combines a force-sensing cage with a haptic-based control strategy to establish and maintain contact with the upper surface of the branches. Surface eDNA is then collected using an adhesive surface integrated in the cage of the drone. We show that the drone can autonomously land on a variety of branches with stiffnesses between 1 and 10
              3
               newton/meter without prior knowledge of their structural stiffness and with robustness to linear and angular misalignments. Validation in the natural environment demonstrates that our method is successful in detecting animal species, including arthropods and vertebrates. Combining robotics with eDNA sampling from a variety of unreachable aboveground substrates can offer a solution for broad-scale monitoring of biodiversity.

	abstract = {Introduction – Understanding the complex chemical signalling of plants and insects is an important component of chemical ecology. Accordingly, the collection and analysis of chemical cues from plants in their natural environment is integral to elucidation of plant–insect communications. Remote plant locations and the need for a large number of replicates make in situ headspace analyses a daunting logistical challenge. A hand-held, portable GC-MS system was used to discriminate between damaged and undamaged Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle) flower heads in both a potted-plant and natural setting.
Objective – To determine if a portable GC-MS system was capable of distinguishing between undamaged and mechanically damaged plant treatments, and plant environments.
Methodology – A portable GC-MS utilising needle trap adsorbent technology was used to collect and analyse in situ headspace volatiles of varying yellow starthistle treatments. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to distinguish treatments and identify biomarker volatiles. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine differences between treatment volatile amounts.
Results – The portable GC-MS system detected 31 volatiles from the four treatments. Each GC-MS run was completed in less than 3 min. PCA showed four distinct clusters representing the four treatments – damaged and undamaged potted plant, and damaged and undamaged natural plant. Damage-specific volatiles were identified.
Conclusion – The portable GC-MS system distinguished the treatments based on their detected volatile profiles. Additional statistical analysis identified five possible biomarker volatiles for the treatments, among them cyclosativene and copaene, which indicated damaged flower heads.

Objectives: In this study, we evaluated the use of the new portable Torion T-9 GC–MS system for rapid and in situ analysis of VOCs emitted by fine lavender and lavandin species. Material and methods: All field analyses were performed using a person-portable low-thermal mass GC system coupled with a miniature toroidal ion trap mass analyser (ppGC-ITMS): Torion T-9 portable GC–MS. Subsequently, multivariate statistical analyses were performed to determine chemical differences between species.
Results: Thirty compounds were separated and detected in all lavender aboveground samples in only 3 min of analysis.

The particular focus is on bacterial, fungal, and viral infections, and insect damage. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from plants, which provide functional information about the plant’s growth, defense, and health status, allow for the possibility of using noninvasive detection to monitor plants status. Electronic noses are comprised of a sensor array, signal conditioning circuit, and pattern recognition algorithms. Compared with traditional gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques, electronic noses are noninvasive and can be a rapid, cost-effective option for several applications. However, using electronic noses for plant pest diagnosis is still in its early stages, and there are challenges regarding sensor performance, sampling and detection in open areas, and scaling up measurements. This review paper introduces each element of electronic nose systems, especially commonly used sensors and pattern recognition methods, along with their advantages and limitations. It includes a comprehensive comparison and summary of applications, possible challenges, and potential improvements of electronic nose systems for different plant pest diagnoses.},

              Pheromones have become an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional insecticides for pest control. Most current pheromone-based pest control products target lepidopteran pests of high-value crops, as today’s manufacturing processes cannot yet produce pheromones at low enough costs to enable their use for lower-value crops, especially commodity crops.

            Notwithstanding popular perception, the environmental impacts of organic agriculture, particularly with respect to pesticide use, are not well established. Fueling the impasse is the general lack of data on comparable organic and conventional agricultural fields. We identify the location of {\textasciitilde}9,000 organic fields from 2013 to 2019 using field-level crop and pesticide use data, along with state certification data, for Kern County, CA, one of the US’ most valuable crop producing counties. We parse apart how being organic relative to conventional affects decisions to spray pesticides and, if spraying, how much to spray using both raw and yield gap-adjusted pesticide application rates, based on a global meta-analysis. We show the expected probability of spraying any pesticides is reduced by about 30 percentage points for organic relative to conventional fields, across different metrics of pesticide use including overall weight applied and coarse ecotoxicity metrics. We report little difference, on average, in pesticide use for organic and conventional fields that do spray, though observe substantial crop-specific heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {The enhancement of pest regulation service in crops depends for a large part on the capacity of agroecological practices to increase the presence of key species or functional traits in arthropod communities within fields. We investigated the effects of undestroyed strips of winter cover crops in maize fields on carabid community composition, and on the distribution of three ecological traits: diet, wing status and body size. We found that the community composition and the distribution of ecological traits in the in-field cover crop strips had commonalities with both adjacent cropped areas and field margins. Some species were recorded mostly or only in the strips indicating that strips could support carabid species and help increase local diversity from the first year of establishment. The activity-density of Poecilus cupreus and Pterostichus melanarius was higher in the cropped proximity of the strip, and the body size was influenced by the distance from the strip. Our results suggest that carabid communities are shaped by the habitat type, but the influence of such agroecological infrastructures on communities of adjacent crops is minor beyond a distance of 10 m. However, overall species abundance was increased and thus potentially provided enhanced pest regulation.},

	abstract = {Food is the essential and fundamental requirement of all living things. Since the availability of  various food growing resources is limited, not expandable, or not in human control like agricultural land, fossil fuel, and underground water. Food demand has risen at a rapid rate in recent decades. World powers are trying to adopt smart farming to expand agriculture and allied sectors to acquire the food requirement. Smart agriculture technologies are required to advance crop and livestock value chain development, improve productivity, and sustain. Smart farming technologies use data and technology to enhance the economic yield of agricultural output as well as optimize farming process inputs throughout the food supply chain, including transportation, distribution, and retail. This paper seeks to review new farming technology to improve food productivity to meet the world demand considering human health. Various types of new technology are available for organic farming such as the Internet of Things, precision farming, livestock farming, renewable energy, artificial intelligence using sensors, robots, unmanned guided vehicles. Scientific databases were searched for review articles by using different keywords: ‘agriculture tool’, smart farming’, ‘farming techniques’, ‘modern agriculture’, ‘productivity’, ‘ergonomics’, after applying selection criteria, 64 articles related to smart farming selected. Bibliometric analysis was carried out to obtain the relevant information by using RStudio (desktop 2022.02.0.443) such as leading authors, sources, annual production, keywords, and countrywide available literature that statistically contributes to smart farming research. We concluded that new agricultural technologies suitable for small farmers have enormous potential to reduce poverty and promote rural development.},

	abstract = {In today's world drones are playing a vital role in all the fields. The drone controlling needs some precession skills and they can be controlled by skilled persons. In recent days, wireless applications are widely extended in the scientific, educational, and hobbyist communities. Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a connection between the human brain and computers. The scope is concentrated on the development boards which permit wireless communications. The neurons of our brains are capable of producing waves with certain frequencies. The frequency of the waves depends on our thought and actions performed by the brain. In present world, some hardware devices are available to sense the brain waves and process them. One such is the EEG (Electroencephalography) device; the EEG registers the ionic current flows within the neurons of the human brain along the surface of the head (scalp). The electrical signals generated in the brain are captured by the mind wave sensor and further the waves are processed with the BCI. The BCI gives commands microcontroller board and the pre-programmed microcontroller board sends the commands to the transmitter device of the drone. Based on the frequency of the wave produced by the neurons of the brain, the transmitter of the drone is controlled. And finally, the transmitter transmits signals to the receiver which is placed in the drone, thus controlling the actions of the drone. By implementing this type of EEG technique along with the BCI, even the professional drones can also be controlled by a common person with a few training in controlling the brain. The paper deals with the integration of BCI technology with unmanned aerial vehicles.},

UAVs offer the benefit of permanent deployment of IoT nodes at remote locations as well as coverage of temporary events by the virtue of their mobility. UAV enabled IoT systems as any other IoT system tend to generate huge amounts of variety of data at very high rate. Efficient use of this unstructured data in the form of text, images, videos, audios etc., is crucial. Crowd surveillance is a typical use case of UAV enabled IoT that requires real time or near to real time big data analytics. The obvious use of artificial intelligence (AI) in such systems is to bring automation and intelligence for faster and efficient big data analytics. Another important use of AI is in the administration and governance of UAV enabled IoT system itself. The advanced AI techniques are important in implementing highly autonomous UAV operations. Few operations are path finding, flight schedules, navigation, authentication etc. AI can further assist in improving security of UAVs. Machine learning (ML) techniques can assure secured transmission of data between IoT devices and UAVs. This work presents a comprehensive survey of research for exploring applications of AI in UAV enabled IoT systems. It specifically focuses on the research in the field of convergence of three disruptive technologies namely AI, UAVs and IoT for improving the quality of life.

	abstract = {The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) assistance in IoT has gained a lot of attention in recent intelligent systems. The limited battery capacity of UAVs proves them to be energy constrained devices. The energy of the device can be either conserved or new mechanisms can be developed for increasing its efficiency. This brief details about both of those techniques like a multiple-period charging process, the combination of Markov decision process and Random Serial Dictatorship matching algorithm. To minimize the packet loss in IoT networks, optimal data collection and microwave power transfer during flight trajectory of UAV, the onboard double Q-learning scheduling algorithm is used. To ensure effective routing and scheduling in UAVs, deep reinforcement learning based channel and power allocation framework is used for decision making tasks to accomplish accurate mission, collision free navigation and efficient energy management. The UAVs are assisted with token free energy supply from the charging station with a facility to repay back with interest or late fees. An UAV-assisted emergency management system can have a secure wireless links incorporated with easy-to-use mobile user interface which can promptly switch the system between “system-efficient mode” and “energy-efficient mode” based on cloud dependent deep learning cognitive algorithms. By cognitive algorithms that provide strategies for tasks to be performed along with flying control when the drone visits each location without knowing the future enable efficient energy management.

This article focuses on mostly used communication techniques in UAVs. The aim is to present a literature and summarize the same in form of challenges and issues arise when developing communication methods for UAVs. The performance comparison has been made at the end of literature study. This article may help new researchers to cope up with existing challenges and issues in UAV communication protocols.},

UAV-based communication networks play an important role in application presently using UAVs and upcoming potential future applications. Besides the number of pros, there are many challenges like line-of-sight communication, distance from the data receiver, limited access to the communication spectrum, energy constraints, and most concerning limited battery power. The focus of this chapter is on studying the techniques available for effective battery and energy manage-ment in UAV-based communication networks. The mechanisms for the optimal utilization of energy resources by UAVs to maximize their lifespan or deployment in a network are critically examined. This helps in a significant reduction in the usage of network energy resulting in a prolonged network lifetime. Further potentially promising areas for future research are also explored.},

This article presents a methodological framework to co-design climate-smart farming systems with local stakeholders (farmers, scientists, NGOs) so that large-scale change can be achieved. This framework is based on the lessons learned during a research project conducted in Honduras and Colombia from 2015 to 2017. Seven phases are suggested to engage a process of co-conception of climate-smart farming systems that might enable implementation at scale: (1) “exploration of the initial situation,” which identifies local stakeholders potentially interested in being involved in the process, existing farming systems, and specific constraints to the implementation of climate-smart agriculture (CSA); (2) “co-definition of an innovation platform,” which defines the structure and the rules of functioning for a platform favoring the involvement of local stakeholders in the process; (3) “shared diagnosis,” which defines the main challenges to be solved by the innovation platform; (4) “identification and ex ante assessment of new farming systems,” which assess the potential performances of solutions prioritized by the members of the innovation platform under CSA pillars; (5) “experimentation,” which tests the prioritized solutions on-farm; (6) “assessment of the co-design process of climate-smart farming systems,” which validates the ability of the process to reach its initial objectives, particularly in terms of new farming systems but also in terms of capacity building; and (7) “definition of strategies for scaling up/out,” which addresses the scaling of the co-design process. For each phase, specific tools or methodologies are used: focus groups, social network analysis, theory of change, life-cycle assessment, and on-farm experiments. Each phase is illustrated with results obtained in Colombia or Honduras.},

Concretely, technologies like Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), Image Processing, Machine Learning, Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), are expected to bring significant changes in this area. Expected benefits are the increase in production, the decrease in cost by reducing the inputs needed such as fuel, fertilizer and pesticides, the reduction in labor efforts, and finally improvement in the quality of the final products. Such innovative methods are crucial in recent days, due to the exponential increase of the global population, the importance of producing healthier products grown with as much fewer pesticides, where public opinion of European citizens is sensitized. Moreover, due to the globalization of the world economy, European countries face the low cost of production of other low-income countries. In this vein, Europe tries to evolve its agriculture domain using technology, aiming at the sustainability of its agricultural sector. Although many surveys exist, most of them tackle in a specific scientific area of Smart Farming. An overview of Smart Farming covering all the involved technologies and providing an extensive reference of good practices around Europe is essential. Our expectation from our work is to become a good reference for researchers and help them with their future work. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive reference for European research efforts in Smart Farming and is two-fold. First, we present the research efforts from researchers in Smart Farming, who apply innovative technology trends in various crops around Europe. Second, we provide and analyze the most significant projects in Europe in the area of Smart Farming.},

	abstract = {Crop models mathematically represent dynamic point-scale interactions between plant, weather, soil and management practices. They have been increasingly applied large scale (i.e. from farm-level to regional and global applications) to understand and quantify the trade-off between productivity, management and the sustainability of cropping systems, in terms of responsible use of resources (e.g. water and nitrogen) and of adaptation to or mitigation of climate change impacts. This contribution reviews the most recent information about spatializing crop models and provides a comprehensive overview of major assumptions and criticalities related to this methodological approach. The first paragraph focuses on the definition of crop models, presenting their historical evolution and main fields of application. A bibliometric analysis was carried out on 1017 scientific papers published between 1990 and 2018 in order to identify the most frequent scientific topics concerning the adoption of crop simulation modelling for sustainable agriculture. The second section describes the main sources of uncertainty in spatializing crop models, addressing two main aspects. Firstly, basic assumptions and validity domains of processes/phenomena represented may still not be valid when applied in a different spatial resolution. Secondly, reference input data needed to characterize the cropping system under study, to run models and test their performance at large scale can often be scarce and/or uncertain due to aggregation/disaggregation issues. The third section defines the minimum amount of data about environment (i.e. site, weather, soil), management (e.g. sowing and harvest date, cultivars and crop operations adopted) and crop type, needed to operate crop models at a given location under current/future climate scenarios. Necessary methodological indications for building a multi-layer georeferenced database facilitating coupling with biophysical models are also provided. Ways of integrating proxy variables (e.g. obtained from pedo-transfer functions and remote sensing data) and crop models have been reported. The last section presents two case studies dealing with the spatialized application of crop models to promote the sustainability of agriculture. A European case study is centred on the definition of farmer adaptation strategies to alleviate climate change impacts, while a regional case study evaluates the efficiency of water management and water footprint of tomato cultivation in Southern Italy.},

	abstract = {Agriculture faces the challenge of providing food, fibre and energy from limited land resources to satisfy the changing needs of a growing world population. Global megatrends, e.g., climate change, influence environmental production factors; production and consumption thus must be continuously adjusted to maintain the producer–consumer-equilibrium in the global food system. While, in some parts of the world, smallholder farming still is the dominant form of agricultural production, the use of digital information for the highly efficient cultivation of large areas has become part of agricultural practice in developed countries. Thereby, the use of satellite data to support site-specific management is a major trend. Although the most prominent use of satellite technology in farming still is navigation, Earth Observation is increasingly applied. Some operational services have been established, which provide farmers with decision-supporting spatial information. These services have mostly been boosted by the increased availability of multispectral imagery from NASA and ESA, such as the Landsat or Copernicus programs, respectively. Using multispectral data has arrived in the agricultural commodity chain. Compared to multispectral data, spectrally continuous narrow-band sampling, often referred to as hyperspectral sensing, can potentially provide additional information and/or increased sampling accuracy. However, due to the lack of hyperspectral satellite systems with high spatial resolution, these advantages mostly are not yet used in practical farming. This paper summarizes where hyperspectral data provide additional value and information in an agricultural context. It lists the variables of interest and highlights the contribution of hyperspectral sensing for information-driven agriculture, preparing the application of future operational spaceborne hyperspectral missions.},

A huge quantity of quality crops beneficial to humankind have been produced using such innovations. However, a lot of degraded lands, environmental conditions have not been properly utilized to achieve the best possible yield to serve the increasing population. Due to poor post-harvest management such as ignorance and unsystematic storage caused huge losses of production. Smart and precise solutions to post-harvest management can be achieved using new technologies. To improve crop yield and product quality modern technological tools have been introduced, and termed as “Smart farming.” Smart farming techniques can allow farmers to use fertilizers/pesticides in crops as per the requirement. Integrating suitable electronic devices/sensors in soil, surrounding environment, or crops, and employing data acquisition, such estimations can help sustainable agriculture. Such agricultural practices can make the best possible use of soil in a particular area, provide useful information related to the crop, and post-harvest management. Recent studies have used smart farming techniques like data acquisition to estimate crop quality and detect faults. Therefore, the artificial intelligence provides data-driven solutions with many advantages. These technique(s) could help to reduce the loss of fruits and vegetables along with the agricultural field crops. For example, site-specific crop management concept – that monitors the variability in fields and crops, accurate agricultural information, etc.},

In the present day context, the decision support system concept has been extended to the spatial dimension by integrating GIS and DSS into spatial decision support systems (SDSS). Due to the lack of computer software to develop user friendly interfaces in the past, GIS have not been used as part of SDSS. Instead GIS have been used to generate and store spatial data which were used that time as inputs for the analytical or manual statistical models. GIS was used independently to display maps by inputting results of the analytical models. With the passing time much of the research has been done on the use of GIS in the visualisation of the results of the analytical models. Developing user friendly graphical interfaces in incorporating analytical models into GIS to arrive at SDSS's is one of the active areas in modern day agricultural management system. Technological or precision farming, a combination of GIS,GPS receivers, continuous yield sensors, geostatistics and variable rate applicators is an innovative approach to practice of sustainable agriculture.

	abstract = {Remote detection and monitoring of the vegetation responses to stress became relevant for sustainable agriculture. Ongoing developments in optical remote sensing technologies have provided tools to increase our understanding of stress-related physiological processes. Therefore, this study aimed to provide an overview of the main spectral technologies and retrieval approaches for detecting crop stress in agriculture. Firstly, we present integrated views on: i) biotic and abiotic stress factors, the phases of stress, and respective plant responses, and ii) the affected traits, appropriate spectral domains and corresponding methods for measuring traits remotely. Secondly, representative results of a systematic literature analysis are highlighted, identifying the current status and possible future trends in stress detection and monitoring. Distinct plant responses occurring under short-term, medium-term or severe chronic stress exposure can be captured with remote sensing due to specific light interaction processes, such as absorption and scattering manifested in the reflected radiance, i.e. visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), shortwave infrared, and emitted radiance, i.e. solar-induced fluorescence and thermal infrared (TIR). From the analysis of 96 research papers, the following trends can be observed: increasing usage of satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle data in parallel with a shift in methods from simpler parametric approaches towards more advanced physically-based and hybrid models. Most study designs were largely driven by sensor availability and practical economic reasons, leading to the common usage of VIS-NIR-TIR sensor combinations. The majority of reviewed studies compared stress proxies calculated from single-source sensor domains rather than using data in a synergistic way. We identified new ways forward as guidance for improved synergistic usage of spectral domains for stress detection: (1) combined acquisition of data from multiple sensors for analysing multiple stress responses simultaneously (holistic view); (2) simultaneous retrieval of plant traits combining multi-domain radiative transfer models and machine learning methods; (3) assimilation of estimated plant traits from distinct spectral domains into integrated crop growth models. As a future outlook, we recommend combining multiple remote sensing data streams into crop model assimilation schemes to build up Digital Twins of agroecosystems, which may provide the most efficient way to detect the diversity of environmental and biotic stresses and thus enable respective management decisions.},

Among various VOCs, methyl salicylate (MeSA) is released abundantly during pathogenic infections because MeSA is emitted not only at the infected site but also throughout the whole plant as a systemic response. In this work, 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA) functionalized Au nanoparticles were employed as a probe for MeSA vapor sensing via surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. The SERS sensors can detect MeSA as low as 0.608 ppb (S/N of 3) with excellent intra- and interassay reproducibility. The origin of Raman signal change was attributed to the weak, reversible intermolecular interaction between MPBA and MeSA. This study demonstrates that the SERS sensing platform holds great promise in noninvasive and fast monitoring of volatile biomarkers for crop health.},

AP-infected trees show typical symptoms such as witches' broom, enlarged stipules, tasteless, and dwarf fruits. PD-infected pears show a progressive weakening, reduced terminal growth, smaller fruits, and die within weeks (quick decline) or years (slow decline). The diseases are caused by the cell-wall lacking bacteria Candidatus Phytoplasma mali (AP phytoplasma) and Ca. P. pyri (PD phytoplasma), respectively. In previous studies it has been shown that AP-infected apple trees emitted higher amounts of the sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene, an attractant of the insect vector Cacopsylla picta (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), thereby facilitating the dispersal of AP phytoplasma. In the present study, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) occurring in the headspace of plants infected with Ca. P. mali strains causing different severity of symptoms in apple plants were collected, analyzed, and identified. Headspace samples from healthy and AP-infected model plant tobacco (Nicotiana occidentalis) and apple (Malus domestica) as well as from healthy and PD-infected pear (Pyrus communis) were investigated via thermodesorption and GC-MS analysis. Significantly higher concentrations of ethyl benzoate were produced in all phytoplasma-infected plants compared to healthy ones and an as yet unidentified sesquiterpene differed between the odor bouquets of healthy and by Ca. P. mali infected tobacco plants. Additionally, statistically significant higher amounts of both compounds were measured in the headspace of plants infected by the virulent AP strain. In apple, significantly higher concentrations of ethyl benzoate and methyl salicylate were observed for trees infected with strains of Ca. P. mali. Ethyl benzoate was also detected in the headspace of pear trees infected with Ca. P. pyri.},

Dynamic sampling coupled with gas chromatography and followed by an appropriate detector is considered as the most appropriate method for application in agriculture. It is recommended to evaluate the state-of-the-art in the ﬁelds concerned with this method and to explore the development of a new instrument based on the speciﬁc needs for application in agricultural practice. However, to apply such an instrument in agriculture remains a challenge, mainly due to high costs.},

One such tree is the commercially important avocado (Persea americana), the second largest tree crop in Florida other than citrus (Citrus sp.). This disease affects the industry in South Florida and two larger avocado industries in Mexico and California have taken notice. Trees succumb soon after infection, and once external symptoms are evident, the disease is very difficult to control and contain as the pathogen can spread to adjacent trees via root grafting. Presently, there is no viable, cost-effective method of early diagnosis and treatment. This study was undertaken to evaluate the use of scent-discriminating canines (Canis familiaris) for the detection of laurel wilt–affected wood from avocado trees. Three canines, one Belgian Malinois and two Dutch Shepherds, were trained and studied for this ability. In addition, prevailing weather conditions were recorded and evaluated to determine their effect on canine performance. The results of this evaluation indicated that canines can detect laurel wilt–affected wood and the laurel wilt pathogen and may be useful in the detection of laurel wilt–diseased trees in commercial groves.},

Underlying chemical-ecological mechanisms have been demonstrated in controlled settings, primarily for some of the best-established cereal PPT systems developed in east Africa. Yet, many questions remain regarding mechanisms, and strategies to adapt PPT for different crops and locations. We conducted a systematic review of scientific literature on PPT and related practices for biological control of pests of food and fodder. Of 3335 results, we identified 45 reporting on chemistry of trap- or intercropping systems for pest control, of which 30 focused on cereals or African pests. Seven of these reported primary chemical data: measurements from glasshouse and laboratory studies (5), or of field-collected samples (2). From these 30, we provide a database of compounds, discussing degrees of evidence for their mediation of push-pull. We depict hypothesized spatial distributions of selected compounds in PPT fields from physical properties and emission/exudation rates, and design of the east African cereal PPT system, and discuss influences on activity in field settings likely to affect success.},

	abstract = {Close-range spectral imaging (SI) of agricultural plants is widely performed for digital plant phenotyping. A key task in digital plant phenotyping is the non-destructive and rapid identification of drought stress in plants so as to allow plant breeders to select potential genotypes for breeding drought-resistant plant varieties. Visible and near-infrared SI is a key sensing technique that allows the capture of physicochemical changes occurring in the plant under drought stress. The main challenges are in processing the massive spectral images to extract information relevant for plant breeders to support genotype selection. Hence, this study presents a generic data processing workflow for analysing SI data generated in real-world digital phenotyping experiments to extract meaningful information for decision making by plant breeders. The workflow is a combination of chemometric approaches and deep learning. The usefulness of the proposed workflow is demonstrated on a real-life experiment related to drought stress detection and quantification in Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown in a semi-controlled environment. The results show that the proposed approach is able to detect the presence of drought just 3 days after its induction compared to the well-watered plants. Furthermore, the unsupervised clustering approach provides detailed time-series images where the drought-related changes in plants can be followed visually along the time course. The developed approach facilitates digital phenotyping and can thus accelerate breeding of drought-tolerant plant varieties.},

	abstract = {Spatial resolution enhancement is a pre-requisite for integrating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) datasets with the data from other sources. However, the mobility of UAV platforms, along with radiometric and atmospheric distortions, makes the task difficult. In this paper, various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures are explored for resolving the issues related to sub-pixel classification and super-resolution of drone-derived datasets. The main contributions of this work are: 1) network-inversion based architectures for super-resolution and sub-pixel mapping of drone-derived images taking into account their spectral-spatial characteristics and the distortions prevalent in them 2) a feature-guided transformation for regularizing the inversion problem 3) loss functions for improving the spectral fidelity and inter-label compatibility of coarser to finer-scale mapping 4) use of multi-size kernel units for avoiding over-fitting. The proposed approach is the first of its kind in using neural network inversion for super-resolution and sub-pixel mapping. Experiments indicate that the proposed super-resolution approach gives better results in comparison with the sparse-code based approaches which generally result in corrupted dictionaries and sparse codes for multispectral aerial images. Also, the proposed use of neural network inversion, for projecting spatial affinities to sub-pixel maps, facilitates the consideration of coarser-scale texture and color information in modeling the finer-scale spatial-correlation. The simultaneous consideration of spectral bands, as proposed in this study, gives better super-resolution results when compared to the individual band enhancements. The proposed use of different data-augmentation strategies, for emulating the distortions, improves the generalization capability of the framework. Sensitivity of the proposed super-resolution and sub-pixel mapping frameworks with regard to the network parameters is thoroughly analyzed. The experiments over various standard datasets as well as those collected from known locations indicate that the proposed frameworks perform better when compared to the prominent published approaches.},

This study focuses on hyperspectral reflectance data of greenhouse pepper (Capsicum annuum) leaves, obtained by integrated sphere. The reflectance data were transformed into vegetation indices allowing early TSSM damage detection by separation between leaf damage levels. One-way analysis of variance of coupled damage levels was applied to each of the vegetation indices. We concluded that early identification of TSSM greenhouse pepper leaf damage can be obtained by multispectral means.

	abstract = {In contrast to the rapid digitalization of several industries, agriculture suffers from low adoption of climate-smart farming tools. Even though AI-driven digital agriculture can offer high-performing predictive functionalities, it lacks tangible quantitative evidence on its benefits to the farmers. Field experiments can derive such evidence, but are often costly and time consuming. To this end, we propose an observational causal inference framework for the empirical evaluation of the impact of digital tools on target farm performance indicators. This way, we can increase farmers' trust by enhancing the transparency of the digital agriculture market, and in turn accelerate the adoption of technologies that aim to increase productivity and secure a sustainable and resilient agriculture against a changing climate. As a case study, we perform an empirical evaluation of a recommendation system for optimal cotton sowing, which was used by a farmers' cooperative during the growing season of 2021. We leverage agricultural knowledge to develop a causal graph of the farm system, we use the back-door criterion to identify the impact of recommendations on the yield and subsequently estimate it using several methods on observational data. The results show that a field sown according to our recommendations enjoyed a significant increase in yield (12\% to 17\%).},

	abstract = {The measurement of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be influenced by ozone (O3), resulting in sampling artifacts that corrupt the data obtained. Published literature reports both, positive (false enhancements of signal) and negative (loss of signal) artifacts in VOC data due to ozonolysis occurring in the sample gas. To assure good data quality it is essential to be aware of such artifact inducing processes, characterize them and try to minimize the impact with a suitable sampling 5 setup. Here we present results from experiments with a sodium thiosulfate ozone scrubber (Na2S2O3), which is a cost effective and easily applied option for O3 scavenging during gas phase sampling. Simultaneous measurement of selected organic trace gases using gas chromatography- and proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry was performed at different ozone levels (01 ppm) and different relative humidities (0-80 \%). In this way both tropospheric and stratospheric conditions were examined. The measured data show that several carbonyl compounds including acetaldehyde, acetone and propanal show artificial signal 10 enhancement when ozone is present at higher concentrations ({\textgreater}150 ppb) in dry air, while analytes with double bonds like isoprene (measured with GC-MS) and terpenes show lower signals due to reaction with ozone. Both effects can be eliminated or in the case of sesquiterpenes substantially reduced by using Na2S2O3 impregnated quartz filters in the inlet line. With the chosen scrubbing material, relative humidity (RH) substantially improves the scrubbing efficiency. Under surface conditions between 50-80 \% RH, the filter allows accurate measurement of all species examined.},

Here, we present AirMeasurer, an open-source and expandable platform that combines automated image analysis, machine learning and original algorithms to perform trait analysis using 2D/3D aerial imagery acquired by low-cost UAVs in rice (Oryza sativa) trials. We applied the platform to study hundreds of rice landraces and recombinant inbred lines at two sites, from 2019 to 2021. A range of static and dynamic traits were quantified, including crop height, canopy coverage, vegetative indices and their growth rates. After verifying the reliability of AirMeasurer-derived traits, we identified genetic variants associated with selected growth-related traits using genome-wide association study and quantitative trait loci mapping. We found that the AirMeasurer-derived traits had led to reliable loci, some matched with published work, and others helped us to explore new candidate genes. Hence, we believe that our work demonstrates valuable advances in aerial phenotyping and automated 2D/3D trait analysis, providing high-quality phenotypic information to empower genetic mapping for crop improvement.},

We present a new conceptual framework defining information reliability and a practical method to characterize and recover information from amongst olfactory noise. We quantified odour emissions from two tree species, one focal group and one outgroup, to demonstrate our approach using two new R statistical functions. We explore the consequences of relaxing or tightening criteria defining information and, from thousands of odour combinations, we identify and quantify those few likely to be informative. Our method uses core general principles characterizing information while incorporating knowledge of how receivers detect and discriminate odours.

There is little information on the defense responses that are triggered by these plant-plant interactions and the phenomenon has rarely been studied in rice. Using chemical and molecular analyses in combination with insect behavioral and performance experiments we studied how volatiles emitted by rice plants infested by the striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis affect defenses against this pest in conspecific plants. Compared to rice plants exposed to the volatiles from uninfested plants, plants exposed to SSB-induced volatiles showed enhanced direct and indirect resistance to SSB. When subjected to caterpillar damage, the HIPV-exposed plants showed increased expression of jasmonic acid (JA) signaling genes, resulting in JA accumulation and higher levels of defensive proteinase inhibitors. Moreover, plants exposed to SSB-induced volatiles emitted larger amounts of inducible volatiles and were more attractive to the parasitoid Cotesia chilonis. By unraveling the factors involved in HIPV-mediated defense priming in rice we reveal a key defensive role for proteinase inhibitors. These findings pave the way for novel rice management strategies to enhance the plant’s resistance to one of its most devastating pests.},

Aerial insects are particularly hard to sample, despite being the main prey in the air column, with some recent studies attempting to use drones as a collection method. We conducted a study to determine the optimal drone settings for collecting insects above the canopy, where drones are seldom used. By attaching a net to the body of a small, commercial drone, we tested yield from different height, speed, and net settings in wetlands, as well as compared insect diversity across different habitat canopies. Height was the most important setting; grazing the canopy yielded significantly more insects than flying one meter above it. Speed, drone type, and net size did not influence the number of insects caught per trial. Wetland canopies had higher abundance, diversity, and species richness in its arthropod populations compared to forest canopies or lakes. Compared to the yield of Lindgren funnels—a traditional sampling method in entomology—drones captured higher diversity and abundance of insects in a fraction of the time. This study confirms that drones are an efficient and accurate way to collect canopy arthropods.},

In particular, the characteristics of smallholder systems pose a unique challenge in the development of reliable prediction methods. Therefore, in this study, a fast and reproducible new approach to wheat prediction is developed by combining predictors derived from optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) sensors using a diverse set of machine learning and deep learning methods under a small dataset domain. This study takes place in the wheat belt region of Ethiopia and evaluates forty-two predictors that represent the major vegetation index categories of green, water, chlorophyll, dry biomass, and VH polarization SAR indices. The study also applies ﬁeld-collected agronomic data from 165 farm ﬁelds for training and validation. According to results, compared to other methods, a combined automated machine learning (AutoML) approach with a generalized linear model (GLM) showed higher performance. AutoML, which reduces training time, delivered ten inﬂuential parameters. For the combined approach, the mean RMSE of wheat yield was from 0.84 to 0.98 ton/ha using ten predictors from the test dataset, achieving a 99\% conﬁdence interval. It also showed a correlation coefﬁcient as high as 0.69 between the estimated yield and measured yield, and it was less sensitive to the small datasets used for model training and validation. A deep neural network with three hidden layers using the ten inﬂuential parameters was the second model. For this model, the mean RMSE of wheat yield was between 1.31 and 1.36 ton/ha on the test dataset, achieving a 99\% conﬁdence interval. This model used 55 neurons with respective values of 0.1, 0.5, and 1 × 10−4 for the hidden dropout ratio, input dropout ratio, and l2 regularization. The approaches implemented in this study are fast and reproducible and beneﬁcial to predict yield at scale. These approaches could be adapted to predict grain yields of other cereal crops grown under smallholder systems in similar global production systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Understanding uncertainty is essential for utilizing atmospheric volatile organic compound
(VOC) measurements in robust ways to develop atmospheric science. This study
describes an inter-comparison of the VOC data, and the derived uncertainty
estimates, measured with three independent techniques (PTR-MS,
proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry; GC-FID-MS,
gas chromatography with flame-ionization and mass spectrometric detection;
and DNPH–HPLC, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine derivatization followed by analysis by high-performance
liquid chromatography)
during routine monitoring as part of the Sydney Particle Study (SPS) campaign in 2012. Benzene, toluene, C8 aromatics, isoprene,
formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were selected for the comparison, based on
objective selection criteria from the available data. Bottom-up uncertainty
analyses were undertaken for each compound and each measurement system.
Top-down uncertainties were quantified via the inter-comparisons. In all
seven comparisons, the correlations between independent measurement
techniques were high with R2 values with a median of 0.92 (range 0.75–0.98)
and small root mean square of the deviations (RMSD) of the observations from the regression
line with a median of 0.11 (range 0.04–0.23 ppbv). These results
give a high degree of confidence that for each comparison the response of the
two independent techniques is dominated by the same constituents. The slope
and intercept as determined by reduced major axis (RMA) regression gives
a different story. The slopes varied considerably with a median of 1.25 and
a range of 1.16–2.01. The intercepts varied with a median of 0.04 and a range
of −0.03 to 0.31 ppbv. An ideal comparison would give a slope of 1.00
and an intercept of 0. Some sources of uncertainty that are poorly quantified by the bottom-up uncertainty analysis method were identified, including:
contributions of non-target compounds to the measurement of the target compound for benzene, toluene and isoprene by PTR-MS as well as the
under-reporting of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone by the DNPH technique. As well as these, this study has identified a specific
interference of liquid water with acetone measurements by the DNPH technique. These relationships reported for Sydney 2012 were incorporated into a larger analysis with 61 similar published inter-comparison
studies for the same compounds. Overall, for the light aromatics, isoprene and the C1–C3 carbonyls, the uncertainty
in a set of measurements varies by a factor of between 1.5 and 2. These uncertainties (∼50 \%) are significantly higher
than uncertainties estimated using standard propagation of error methods, which in this case were ∼22 \% or less, and are
the result of the presence of poorly understood or neglected processes that affect the measurement and its uncertainty. The
uncertainties in VOC measurements identified here should be considered when assessing the reliability of VOC measurements from routine
monitoring with individual, stand-alone instruments; when utilizing VOC data to constrain and inform air quality and climate models;
when using VOC observations for human exposure studies; and for comparison with satellite retrievals.},

	abstract = {Understanding ontogenetic differences in plant defenses and herbivory damage is crucial for obtaining a better understanding of plant life-history strategies, community assembly, and dynamics. Although many studies have compared plant defenses or herbivory damage between ontogenetic stages (e.g. sapling vs. adult), how the effects of plant characteristics on leaf herbivory damage change during plant ontogeny has rarely been examined across species or in a species-rich natural community. To elucidate the effects of plant characteristics, we compared the relationships of leaf herbivory by insects with stem density, plant size, and leaf traits between saplings and adults for almost all co-occurring woody species (56 species, ranging from rare to abundant) in a Japanese temperate forest. In most species, adults were larger, fewer in number, and had leaf traits that were potentially less favorable to herbivores (e.g. stronger, or with more phenolics). In contrast, we observed species-specific directions of changes in herbivory damage between adults and saplings with plant phylogeny or density having no clear effect. The relationships between some plant traits and herbivory damage were ontogeny dependent, indicating a shift from chemical to physical defense as plants mature, although most of the species characteristics studied were highly correlated between stages. Such ontogeny-dependent relationships between plant traits and herbivory damage could cause variation in the ontogenetic changes in herbivory damage among species depending on the value of plant traits. Moreover, the direction and magnitude of the effects of ontogenetic differences in species traits on the ontogenetic differences in herbivory damage varied depending on the traits. Together, these factors could have caused the observed ontogenetic changes in herbivory damage among species. Synthesis. Our study demonstrated how relationships between plant characteristics and herbivory damage can change ontogenetically across many coexisting woody species in a forest community, suggesting that plant traits may perform different functions related to herbivory at different ontogenetic stages. This has rarely been considered in previous dualistic comparisons of individual traits and herbivory damage between ontogenetic stages, and it is vital for understanding plant life-history strategies across stages in relationships with herbivores in natural communities.},

	abstract = {Pheromones have become an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional insecticides for pest control. Most current pheromone-based pest control products target lepidopteran pests of high-value crops, as today’s manufacturing processes cannot yet produce pheromones at low enough costs to enable their use for lower-value crops, especially commodity crops. Camelina sativa seeds genetically modified to express (Z)-11-hexadecenoic acid, a sex pheromone precursor of several moth species, provided the oil from which the precursor was isolated, purified and transformed into the final pheromone. Trap lures containing this pheromone were then assessed for their capacity to manage moth pests in the field. Plant-derived pheromone lures proved equally effective as synthetic pheromone lures in monitoring the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, in cabbage and disrupting mating of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, in common bean fields. Our study demonstrates the biological efficacy and economic feasibility of pheromone production in plant factories by metabolic engineering of an oilseed crop.},

More recently, knowledge of the roles of plant VOCs in the aboveground environment has led to the exploration of similar functions in the soil and rhizosphere. Moreover, VOC patterns have been recognized as sensitive and time-dependent markers of biotic and abiotic stress. This focused review addresses these developments by presenting recent progress in VOC sampling and analysis. We show advances in the use of small, inexpensive sampling devices and describe methods to monitor plant VOC emissions in the belowground environment. We further address latest trends in real-time measurements of volatilomes in plant phenotyping and most recent developments of small portable devices and VOC sensors for non-invasive VOC fingerprinting of plant disease.

We assessed the genetic variability of these induced volatile emissions among 31 maize inbred lines representing a broad range of genetic diversity used by breeders in Europe and North America. Odors were collected from young plants that had been induced by injecting them with caterpillar regurgitant. Significant variation among lines was found for all 23 volatile compounds included in the analysis: the lines differed enormously in the total amount of volatiles emitted and showed highly variable odor profiles distinctive of each genotype. Principal component analysis performed on the relative quantities of particular compounds within the blend revealed clusters of highly correlated volatiles, which may share common metabolic pathways. European and American lines belonging to established heterotic groups were loosely separated from each other, with the most clear-cut difference in the typical release of (E)-β-caryophyllene by European lines. There was no correlation between the distances among the lines based on their odor profiles and their respective genetic distances previously assessed by neutral RFLP markers. This most comprehensive study to date on intraspecific variation in induced odor emission by maize plants provides a further example of the remarkably high genetic diversity conserved within this important crop plant. A better understanding of the genetic control of induced odor emissions may help in the development of maize varieties particularly attractive to parasitoids and other biological control agents and perhaps more repellent for herbivores.},

	abstract = {Corn seedlings release large amounts of terpenoid volatiles after they have been fed upon by caterpillars. Artificially damaged seedlings do not release these volatiles in significant amounts unless oral secretions from the caterpillars are applied to the damaged sites. Undamaged leaves, whether or not they are treated with oral secretions, do not release detectable amounts of the terpenoids. Females of the parasitic wasp Cotesia marginiventris (Cresson) learn to take advantage of those plant-produced volatiles to locate hosts when exposed to these volatiles in association with hosts or host by-products. The terpenoids may be produced in defense against herbivores but may also serve a secondary function in attracting the natural enemies of these herbivores. M O OST STUDIES ON THE SIGNIFIcance of herbivore-induced production of secondary metabolites in plants focus on the direct ecological interactions between plants and the herbivores that feed on them (1-3). Only a few investigators (4-6) have suggested active interactions between herbivore-damaged plants and the third trophic level of insect parasit-oids and predators. There are many examples of these insects being attracted to plant odors (7), but only recently have studies indicated an active involvement of plants (5, 6). Dicke and co-workers presented the first convincing evidence for an active release of volatiles by herbivore-infested plants that attract natural enemies of the herbivorous attackers (6). As yet, no herbivore-specific factor that induces characteristic changes in plants, used by foraging entomophagous insects, has been pinpointed. It is common that parasitic wasps learn to respond to specific odors that are associated with their hosts (8). The often observed flexibility in these responses has been attributed to the variability in space and time of reliable cues that may best guide the wasps to available hosts (9). Their ability to learn should allow parasitoids to distinguish among odors of plants with different types of damage, thus enabling them to focus on plants damaged by potential hosts. Chemical responses evoked in plants by herbivorous hosts may therefore play an important role in host-habitat location by parasitoids. We report that herbivore-inflicted injury induces plants to release volatile terpenoids. The plant response is greatly enhanced by the oral secretions of caterpillars and is exploited by the parasitic wasp C. mnargini-ventris, which uses the terpenoids as cues to locate hosts. In flight tunnel trials, females of the para-sitoid C. marginiventris are attracted to the odors emanating from a complex of host larvae feeding on corn (Zea mays L., var. "Ioana sweet corn") seedlings (10). Of the three main components of a complete plant-host complex, the damaged plants, and not the host larvae or their feces, are the main source of the volatiles that attract the para-sitoid (10). Volatiles from a complete plant-host complex consisting of beet armyworm larvae (BAW), Spodoptera exigua (Hubner), that were feeding on corn seedlings inside an all-glass collection system (11) were collected in traps containing Super Q adsorbent (12). Gas chromatographic analyses of methylene chloride washes of the traps revealed the consistent presence of eleven compounds (Fig. 1). The first four most volatile compounds were identified as leafy aldehydes, an alcohol, and an acetate, commonly found in the leaves of many plants (13). The remaining compounds were, except for in-dole, all terpenoids. All the identified compounds are released by the caterpillar-damaged seedlings and not by the caterpillars themselves nor by something in their feces or other by-products (14). Additional volatile collections, however , revealed that the larger terpenoids, particularly ot-trans-bergamotene, (E)-,B-farne-sene, and (E)-nerolidol, were only released by leaves that had been damaged by caterpillars for several hours. Plants subjected to caterpillar damage for 2 hours released the larger terpenoids only in minute amounts immediately afterward. The following day, however, large amounts of these compounds could be detected (Fig. 2). Fast growing plants like corn invest much of their energy in growth and little in de-Fig. 1. A chromatographic profile 1 4 IS of the volatiles collected from a H complex of BAW caterpillars feeding on corn seedlings. The identi-3O fied compounds are 1, (Z)-3-hex-OH enal; 2, (E)-2-hexenal; 3, (Z)-3-hexen-l-ol; 4, (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate ; 5, linalool; 6, (3E)4,8-di-methyl-1,3,7-nonatriene; 7, indole; 8, a-trans-bergamotene; 9, (E)-,B-far-nesene; 10, (E)-nerolidol; and 11, 2 OH 8 (3E,7E)4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-H L6 tridecatetraene.

Volatiles were collected for 2 hours in traps containing 25 mg of Super Q adsorbent (12). The traps were then extracted with 200 pIl of methylene chloride and an internal standard (IS) in 50 ,ul of methylene chloride (n-nonyl-acetate, 20 ng/pl) was added. Of the extract 2.5 ,ul was injected onto a Quadrex methyl silicone column (50 m by 0.25 mm inside diameter, 0.25 p.m film) inside a Varian model 3700 gas chromatograph. Temperature program: 50°C, rate 5°C/min to 180°C. Compounds were identified by mass spectroscopy and, where necessary, by NMR spectroscopy.

	abstract = {Food insecurity is a chronic problem in Africa and is likely to worsen with climate change and population growth. It is largely due to poor yields of the cereal crops caused by factors including stemborer pests, striga weeds and degraded soils. A platform technology, 'push-pull', based on locally available companion plants, effectively addresses these constraints resulting in substantial grain yield increases. It involves intercropping cereal crops with a forage legume, desmodium, and planting Napier grass as a border crop. Desmodium repels stemborer moths (push), and attracts their natural enemies, while Napier grass attracts them (pull). Desmodium is very effective in suppressing striga weed while improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation and improved organic matter content. Both companion plants provide high-value animal fodder, facilitating milk production and diversifying farmers' income sources. To extend these benefits to drier areas and ensure long-term sustainability of the technology in view of climate change, drought-tolerant trap and intercrop plants are being identified. Studies show that the locally commercial brachiaria cv mulato (trap crop) and greenleaf desmodium (intercrop) can tolerate long droughts. New on-farm field trials show that using these two companion crops in adapted push-pull technology provides effective control of stemborers and striga weeds, resulting in significant grain yield increases. Effective multi-level partnerships have been established with national agricultural research and extension systems, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders to enhance dissemination of the technology with a goal of reaching one million farm households in the region by 2020. These will be supported by an efficient desmodium seed production and distribution system in eastern Africa, relevant policies and stakeholder training and capacity development.},

The push and pull components are generally nontoxic. Therefore, the strategies are usually integrated with methods for population reduction, preferably biological control. Push-pull strategies maximize efficacy of behavior-manipulating stimuli through the additive and synergistic effects of integrating their use. By orchestrating a predictable distribution of pests, efficiency of population-reducing components can also be increased. The strategy is a useful tool for integrated pest management programs reducing pesticide input. We describe the principles of the strategy, list the potential components, and present case studies reviewing work on the development and use of push-pull strategies in each of the major areas of pest control.},

	abstract = {Many plant and insect interactions are governed by odors released by the plants or insects and there exists a continual need for new or improved methods to collect and identify these odors. Our group has for some time studied below-ground, plant-produced volatile signals affecting nematode and insect behavior. The research requires repeated sampling of volatiles of intact plant/soil systems in the laboratory as well as the field with the help of probes to minimize unwanted effects on the systems we are studying. After evaluating solid adsorbent filters with solvent extraction or solid phase micro extraction fiber sample collection, we found dynamic sampling of small air volumes on Tenax TA filters followed by thermal desorption sample introduction to be the most suitable analytical technique for our applications. Here we present the development and evaluation of a low-cost and relatively simple thermal desorption technique where a cold trap cooled with liquid carbon dioxide is added as an integral part of a splitless injector. Temperature gradient-based focusing and low thermal mass minimizes aerosol formation and eliminates the need for flash heating, resulting in low sample degradation comparable to solvent-based on-column injections. Additionally, since the presence of the cold trap does not affect normal splitless injections, on-the-fly switching between splitless and thermal desorption modes can be used for external standard quantification.},

	abstract = {The accurate teleoperation of robotic devices requires simple, yet intuitive and reliable control interfaces. However, current human-machine interfaces (HMIs) often fail to fulfill these characteristics, leading to systems requiring an intensive practice to reach a sufficient operation expertise. Here, we present a systematic methodology to identify the spontaneous gesture-based interaction strategies of naive individuals with a distant device, and to exploit this information to develop a data-driven body-machine interface (BoMI) to efficiently control this device. We applied this approach to the specific case of drone steering and derived a simple control method relying on upper-body motion. The identified BoMI allowed participants with no prior experience to rapidly master the control of both simulated and real drones, outperforming joy-stick users, and comparing with the control ability reached by participants using the bird-like flight simulator Birdly. human-machine interface {\textbar} body-machine interface {\textbar} immersive drone control {\textbar} teleoperation {\textbar} motor control T eleoperation, a subfield of human-machine interaction (HMI), describes the control at a distance of an actuated device (1). Typical applications include deployments in environments where it is not desirable or possible to send a human operator, such as nuclear plants (2, 3), scenes of natural hazards, or more generally in search and rescue missions (4-6). The use of teleoperated systems can augment human dexterity and precision , which are fundamental abilities in those and other fields of application, such as minimally invasive surgery (7) or micro-fabrication (8). Patients suffering from neurological disorders may benefit as well from teleoperated systems to substitute for lost body functions by controlling wheelchairs (9, 10), telepresence systems (11, 12), or robotic manipulators (13). Successful teleoperation requires robust and reliable control interfaces. A well-defined interaction should be transparent (14, 15), rely on intuitive command inputs to ensure rapid proficiency and minimize the task-associated workload (16), and provide appropriate feedback (visual, auditory, haptic) to strengthen the awareness of the operator (17). A number of existing interfaces already allow interactions with robotic devices. However, simple third-party devices such as a joystick show limited performance even with systems with few degrees of freedom (DOFs). The development of intuitive commands becomes yet more challenging in "nonhomologous" interactions, that is, when the operators' command behaviors significantly differ from the machine's realizable behavior, or when their physical abilities are restricted. A possible approach to address this issue comes from brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which bypass behavioral output by directly retrieving the desired information from the cerebral activity patterns, often relying on mental imagery. Successful examples include the control of humanoids (18), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (19-21), wheelchairs, and telepresence systems for motion-impaired individuals (9-12). BCIs do nonetheless come with certain limitations, which may prevent their widespread utilization. Firstly, the noninvasive signal acquisition is associated with a low signal-to-noise ratio and thus a high sensitivity to perturbations. The use of these systems is therefore limited to relatively controlled environments and may not be suited to everyday activities. Another limitation of this approach comes from the execution of motor imagery tasks, which strongly constrains the user's focus on the completion of the control task. The system is therefore prone to errors in case of unpredicted and undesired stimuli and a long-term operation is likely to be cognitively demanding. Recent and promising developments suggest that body-machine interfaces (BoMIs) are a valuable alternative to BCIs for able-bodied or partially impaired persons. Instead of neural activity patterns, these systems retrieve information from body motion or from the underlying muscular activities (22). The broad spectrum of applications ranges from the control of assistive devices by neurological patients (23-25) to the control of UAVs (26-29). BoMIs present one unambiguous advantage over BCIs: they exploit the fine control the operators can have over their body, while operating a BCI requires to actively modulate the activity of designed cerebral areas, a task for which Significance The teleoperation of nonhumanoid robots is often a demanding task, as most current control interfaces rely on map-pings between the operator's and the robot's actions, which are determined by the design and characteristics of the interface , and may therefore be challenging to master. Here, we describe a structured methodology to identify common patterns in spontaneous interaction behaviors, to implement embodied user interfaces, and to select the appropriate sensor type and positioning. Using this method, we developed an intuitive, gesture-based control interface for real and simulated drones, which outperformed a standard joystick in terms of learning time and steering abilities. Implementing this procedure to identify body-machine patterns for specific applications could support the development of more intuitive and effective interfaces.},

	abstract = {A sampler for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was developed for deployment on a multicopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The sampler was designed to collect gas- and aerosol-phase VOCs on up to four commercially available VOC-adsorbent cartridges for subsequent ofﬂine analysis by thermal-desorption gas chromatography. The sampler had a mass of 0.90 kg and dimensions of 19 cm × 20 cm ×5 cm. Power consumption was {\textless} 10 kJ in a typical 30 min ﬂight, representing {\textless} 3 \% of the total UAV battery capacity. Autonomous sampler operation and data collection in ﬂight were accomplished with a microcontroller. Sampling ﬂows of 100 to 400 sccm were possible, and a typical ﬂow of 150 sccm was used to balance VOC capture efﬁciency with sample volume. The overall minimum detection limit of the analytical method for a 10 min sample was 3 ppt and the uncertainty was larger than 3 ppt or 20 \% for isoprene and monoterpenes. The sampler was mounted to a commercially available UAV and ﬂown in August 2017 over tropical forest in central Amazonia. Samples were collected sequentially for 10 min each at several different altitude–latitude–longitude collection points. The species identiﬁed, their concentrations, their uncertainties, and the possible effects of the UAV platform on the results are presented and discussed in the context of the sampler design and capabilities. Finally, design challenges and possibilities for next-generation samplers are addressed.},

In this regard, hovering unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) represent an emerging technology. The study herein provides guidance for optimized atmospheric sampling by hovering copter-type UAVs. Large-eddy simulations are conducted for species having chemical lifetimes ranging from reactive (i.e., 102 s) to long-lived (i.e., 108 s). The case study of fair-weather conditions over an equatorial tropical forest is used because of previous UAV deployments in this region. A framework is developed of influence length and horizontal shift of upwind surface emissions. The framework quantifies the length scale of the contribution of upwind forest emissions to species concentrations sampled by the downwind hovering UAV. Main findings include the following: (1) sampling within an altitude that is no more than 200 m above the canopy is recommended for both high- and intermediate-reactivity species because of the strong decrease in species concentration even in a highly turbulent atmosphere; (2) sampling durations of at least 5 and 10 min are recommended for intermediate- and high-reactivity species, respectively, because of the effects of atmospheric turbulence; and (3) in the case of heterogeneity of emissions across the underlying landscape, maximum recommended altitudes are presented for horizontal sampling strategies that can resolve the variability in the landscape emissions. The coupled effects of emission rate, wind speed, species lifetime, turbulence, and UAV sampling duration on influence length must all be considered for optimized and representative sampling over forests.},

Atmospheric sampling onboard a multicopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), serving as an economical and flexible measurement technique, collects valuable VOC data sets at intermediate spatial scales of hundreds of meters. In this study, we deployed a UAV-based VOC sampler in South China and conducted VOC samplings at two locations over the canopy of a subtropical forest. The collected VOC samples were analyzed offline by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Isoprene and α-pinene, two dominant biogenic VOCs, showed day-to-night variations that were consistent with their emission patterns. High concentrations of ozone and aromatic VOCs indicate a strong influence of anthropogenic pollution in this forest area. Meanwhile, high ratios of the concentrations of methacrolein and methyl vinyl ketone to isoprene were observed, which are consistent with the possibly fast atmospheric oxidation under the anthropogenic influence. Significant daytime concentration differences were observed between the two sampling locations for isoprene. The analysis by a gradient transport model suggests a large isoprene emission heterogeneity along the mountain slope at the scale of hundreds of meters for subtropical forests, which has not yet been well represented in most biosphere emission models. Strong eddy diffusion caused by the valley breeze may also contribute to the observed concentration differences.},

	abstract = {Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) have great potential as biological control agents against root-feeding insects. They have a rapid and long-lasting mode of action, minimal adverse effects on the environment and can be readily mass-produced. However, they have a relatively short shelf-life and are susceptible to desiccation and UV light. These shortcomings may be overcome by encapsulating EPN in Ca2+-alginate hydrogels, which have been shown to provide a humid and UV protective shelter. Yet, current Ca2+-alginate formulations do not keep EPN vigorous and infectious for a prolonged period of time and do not allow for their controlled release upon application. Here, we introduce solid Ca2+-alginate beads which we supplemented with glycerol to better retain the EPN during storage and to ensure a steady release when applied in soil. Glycerol-induced metabolic arrest in EPN (Heterorhabditis bacteriophora) resulting in quiescence and total retainment of EPN when added to beads made with 0.5\% sodium alginate and 2\% CaCl2·2H2O solutions. More than 4,000 EPN could be embedded in a single 4–5-mm diameter bead, and quiescence could be broken by adding water, after which the EPN readily emerged from the beads. In a field trial, the EPN beads were as effective in reducing root damage by the western corn rootworm (WCR, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) as EPN that were applied in water. Although further improvements are desirable, we conclude that Ca2+-alginate beads can provide an effective and practical way to apply EPN for the control of WCR larvae.},

	abstract = {The timing of plant volatile emissions is important for a robust indirect defense response. Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are emitted by plants upon damage but can be suppressed by herbivore-associated elicitors, and the abundance and composition of GLVs vary depending on the timing of herbivore attack. We show that the GLV biosynthetic enzyme HYDROPEROXIDE LYASE (HPL) is transcriptionally regulated by the circadian clock in Nicotiana attenuata. In accordance with transcript abundance of NaHPL, GLV aldehyde pools in intact leaves peaked at night and at subjective night under diurnal and continuous light conditions, respectively. Moreover, although the basal abundance of NaHPL transcripts is upregulated by jasmonate (JA) signaling, JA does not regulate the reduction of NaHPL transcript abundance in damaged leaves by simulated herbivore treatment. Unexpectedly, the plant circadian clock was strongly altered when Manduca sexta larvae fed on N. attenuata, and this was also independent of JA signaling. Lastly, the temporal dynamics of NaHPL transcripts and total GLV emissions were strongly altered by M. sexta larval feeding. Our data suggest that the temporal dynamics of emitted GLV blends result from a combination of damage, JA signaling, herbivore-associated elicitors, and the plant circadian clock. © 2018 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

Herbivore-induced plant volatile blends commonly include both rapid, transient green leaf volatiles (GLVs) and delayed, enduring sesquiterpenes. A few laboratory studies indicate that insects can use plant volatiles to time behaviour, but it is not known whether and how the temporal dynamics of plant volatile blends influence their function in indirect defence. We characterized the activity of the native herbivores Manduca sexta and Tupiocoris notatus and their predators, Geocoris spp., on their host plant Nicotiana attenuata in their natural habitat. Diurnal predator activity only partially overlapped with variable herbivore activity, and herbivore attack at the beginning or end of the photophase elicited plant volatile blends with distinct GLV and sesquiterpene profiles. In field trials, day-active Geocoris spp. predators preferred morning- over evening-typical GLV blends. Using plants genetically transformed so as to be unable to produce specific volatiles, we found that GLVs increased predation after dawn elicitations, whereas sesquiterpenes increased predation after dusk elicitations in field trials. We conclude that predators respond to temporal differences in plant volatile blends, and that the different dynamics of specific volatiles permit effective indirect defence despite variable herbivore activity in nature.

One challenge of critical importance to society is detecting and localizing airborne volatile chemicals. Many ﬂying animals depend their ability to detect and locate the source of aerial chemical plumes for ﬁnding mates and food sources. A robot with comparable capability could reduce human hazard and drastically improve performance on tasks such as locating disaster survivors, hazardous gas leaks, incipient ﬁres, or explosives. Three advances are needed before they can rival their biological counterparts: (1) a chemical sensor with a much faster response time that nevertheless satisﬁes the size, weight, and power constraints of ﬂight, (2) a design, sensor suite, and control system that allows it to move toward the source of a plume fully autonomously while navigating obstacles, and (3) the ability to detect the plume with high speciﬁcity and sensitivity among the assortment of chemicals that invariably exist in the air. Here we address the ﬁrst two, introducing a human-safe palm-sized air vehicle equipped with the odor-sensing antenna of an insect, the ﬁrst odor-sensing biohybrid robot system to ﬂy. Using this sensor along with a suite of additional navigational sensors, as well as passive wind ﬁns, our robot orients upwind and navigates autonomously toward the source of airborne plumes. Our robot is the ﬁrst ﬂying biohybrid system to successfully perform odor localization in a conﬁned space, and it is able to do so while detecting and avoiding obstacles in its ﬂight path. We show that insect antennae respond more quickly than metal oxide gas sensors, enabling odor localization at an improved speed over previous ﬂying robots. By using the insect antennae, we anticipate a feasible path toward improved chemical speciﬁcity and sensitivity by leveraging recent advances in gene editing.},

	abstract = {Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from forests are important chemical components that affect ecosystem functioning, atmospheric chemistry, and regional climate. Temperature differences between a forest and an adjacent river can induce winds that influence VOC fate and transport. Quantitative observations and scientific understanding, however, remain lacking. Herein, daytime VOC datasets were collected from the surface up to 500 m over the “Rio Negro” river in Amazonia. During time periods of river winds, isoprene, α-pinene, and β-pinene concentrations increased by 50, 60, and 80\% over the river, respectively. The concentrations at 500 m were up to 80\% greater compared to those at 100 m because of the transport path of river winds. By comparison, the concentration of methacrolein, a VOC oxidation product, did not depend on river winds or height. The differing observations for primary emissions and oxidation products can be explained by the coupling of timescales among emission, reaction, and transport. This behavior was captured in large-eddy simulations with a coupled chemistry model. The observed and simulated roles of river winds in VOC fate and transport highlight the need for improved representation of these processes in regional models of air quality and chemistry–climate coupling.},

	abstract = {Both plant physiology and atmospheric chemistry are substantially altered by the emission of volatile isoprenoids (VI), such as isoprene and monoterpenes, from plant leaves. Yet, since gaining scientific attention in the 1950’s, empirical research on leaf VI has been largely confined to laboratory experiments and atmospheric observations. Here, we introduce a new field instrument designed to bridge the scales from leaf to atmosphere, by enabling precision VI detection in real time from plants in their natural ecological setting. With a field campaign in the Brazilian Amazon, we reveal an unexpected distribution of leaf emission capacities (EC) across the vertical axis of the forest canopy, with EC peaking in the mid-canopy instead of the sun-exposed canopy surface, and moderately high emissions occurring in understory specialist species. Compared to the simple interpretation that VI protect leaves from heat stress at the hot canopy surface, our results encourage a more nuanced view of the adaptive role of VI in plants. We infer that forest emissions to the atmosphere depend on the dynamic microenvironments imposed by canopy structure, and not simply on canopy surface conditions. We provide a new emissions inventory from 52 tropical tree species, revealing moderate consistency in EC within taxonomic groups. We highlight priorities in leaf volatiles research that require field-portable detection systems. Our self-contained, portable instrument provides real-time detection and live measurement feedback with precision and detection limits better than 0.5 nmolVI m–2leaf s–1. We call the instrument ‘PORCO’ based on the gas detection method: photoionization of organic compounds. We provide a thorough validation of PORCO and demonstrate its capacity to detect ecologically driven variation in leaf emission rates and thus accelerate a nascent field of science: the ecology and ecophysiology of plant volatiles.},

	abstract = {Jasmonic acid (JA) has long been hypothesized to be an important regulator of insect-induced volatile emission; however, current models are based primarily on circumstantial evidence derived from pharmacological studies. Using beet armyworm caterpillars (BAW: Spodoptera exigua) and intact corn seedlings, we examine this hypothesis by measuring both the time-course of insect-induced JA levels and the relationships between endogenous JA levels, ethylene, indole and sesquiterpenes. In separate Morning and Evening time-course trials, BAW feeding stimulated increases in JA levels within the first 4–6 h and resulted in maximal increases in JA, indole, sesquiterpenes and ethylene 8–16 h later. During BAW herbivory, increases in JA either paralleled or preceded the increases in indole, sesquiterpenes and ethylene in the Morning and Evening trials, respectively. By varying the intensity of the BAW herbivory, we demonstrate that strong positive relationships exist between the resulting variation in insect-induced JA levels and volatile emissions such as indole and the sesquiterpenes. To address potential signaling interactions between herbivore-induced JA and ethylene, plants were pretreated with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), an inhibitor of ethylene perception. 1-MCP pretreatment resulted in reduced production of ethylene and volatile emission following BAW herbivory but did not alter the insect-induced accumulation of JA. Our results strongly support a role for JA in the regulation of insect-induced volatile emission but also suggest that ethylene perception regulates the magnitude of volatile emission during herbivory.},

The precise timing of these emissions upon the onset of herbivore feeding has not been fully elucidated, and the information that is available has been mainly obtained through laboratory based studies. We investigated emissions of VOCs from Populus tremula L. ×P. tremuloides Michx. during the first 20 h of feeding by Epirrita autumnata (autumnal moth) larvae in a field site. The study was conducted using Proton Transfer Reaction-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) to measure emissions online, with samples collected for subsequent analysis by complementary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for purposes of compound identification. GLV emission peaks occurred sporadically from the outset, indicating herbivore activity, while terpene emissions were induced within 16 h. We present data detailing the patterns of monoterpene (MT), GLV and sesquiterpene (SQT) emissions during the early stages of herbivore feeding showing diurnal MT and SQT emission that is correlated more with temperature than light. Peculiarities in the timing of SQT emissions prompted us to conduct a thorough characterization of the equipment used to collect VOCs and thus corroborate the accuracy of results. A laboratory based analysis of the throughput of known GLV, MT and SQT standards at different temperatures was made with PTR-MS. Enclosure temperatures of 12, 20 and 25°C had little influence on the response time for dynamic measurements of a GLV or MT. However, there was a clear effect on SQT measurements. Elucidation of emission patterns in real-time is dependent upon the dynamics of cuvettes at different temperatures.},

	abstract = {The applicability of an aerial drone as a carrier for new passive and active miniaturized air sampling systems, including solid phase microextration Arrow (SPME Arrow) and in-tube extraction (ITEX), was studied in this research. Thermal desorption, gas chromatography and mass spectrometry were used for the determination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) collected by the sampling systems. The direct comparison of the profiles of VOCs, simultaneously sampled in air by SPME Arrow system including four different coatings, allowed the elucidation of their adsorption selectivity. A more complex experimental design, involving 20 samples (10 flights) and non-supervised pattern recognition techniques, was needed for the clarification of the same sampling parameters in the case of five ITEX sorbent materials. In addition, ITEX sampling accessories, such as particle, water and ozone traps, were evaluated by comparing the results obtained for air samples simultaneously collected by two ITEX systems, packed with the same sorbent and furnished or not with sampling accessories. The effect of the aerial drone horizontal displacement (HD) on the sampling efficiency was clear in the case of SPME Arrow. The number of detected compounds and their relative peak area values (RPA) revealed a clear increase (4 and 43\%, respectively) in comparison with samples collected without drone HD. However, just minor differences were observed in the case of ITEX (2 compounds and 9\% of the ∑RPA). In addition, the system was able to provide almost simultaneous passive (SPME Arrow) and active (ITEX) samplings at different altitudes (5 and 50 m), being a good tool for low cost vertical profiling studies (∑RPA decreased over 35\% for the samples collected at 50 m). Finally, the successful simultaneous air sampling by SPME Arrow and ITEX systems in two difficult access places, such as boreal forest and wetlands, was demonstrated, resulting in 21 and 31 detected compounds in forest and wetlands by SPME Arrow, and 27 and 39 compounds by ITEX.},

In Environmental Physics micrometeorology has been very effectively used to study hydrology, environmental physiology, and ecology. The turbulent boundary layer that develops over extensive soil and vegetation surfaces grows at a rate depending on surface roughness and atmospheric stability. Properties of turbulence are discussed, leading to a review of the principles of the eddy covariance method of studying rates of turbulent transfer of heat mass and momentum (fluxes) in the surface boundary layer. Instrumentation requirements for, and corrections necessary to eddy covariance measurements, are summarized. The less direct method of studying turbulent fluxes by relating analyzing mean vertical gradients (profiles) of windspeed, temperature, and mass concentration is also reviewed. Roughness parameters depending on vegetation height and structure influence profile properties. Aerodynamic resistance is derived as a quantity relating momentum flux to windspeed gradients. The influence of atmospheric stability on profiles and therefore on fluxes is reviewed, including issues encountered when measuring close to vegetation elements. Principles of the aerodynamic and Bowen ratio methods for estimating fluxes from gradients are reviewed, and the strengths and weaknesses of eddy covariance and flux-gradient methods are summarized. Finally, aspects of turbulent transfer in vegetation canopies are discussed.},

	abstract = {Herbivore-induced volatiles play an important role in the indirect defense of plants. After herbivore damage, volatiles are released from the plant and can attract herbivore enemies that protect the plant from additional damage. The herbivore-induced volatile blend is complex and usually consists of mono- and sesquiterpenes, aromatic compounds, and indole. Although these classes of compounds are generally produced at different times after herbivore damage, the release of the terpene (E)-β-caryophyllene and the aromatic ester methyl anthranilate appear to be tightly coordinated. We have studied the herbivore induction patterns of two terpene synthases from Zea mays L. (Poaceae), TPS23 and TPS10, as well as S-adenosyl-L-methionine:anthranilic acid carboxyl methyltransferases (AAMT1), which are critical for the production of terpenes and anthranilate compounds, respectively. The transcript levels of tps23 and aamt1 displayed the same kinetics after damage by the larvae of Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and showed the same organ-specific and haplotype-specific expression patterns. Despite its close functional relation to TPS23, the terpene synthase TPS10 is not expressed in roots and does not display the haplotype-specific expression pattern. The results indicate that the same JA-mediated signaling cascade maycontrol the production of both the terpene (E)-β-caryophyllene and aromatic ester methyl anthranilate. © 2012 The Netherlands Entomological Society.},

In seedlings, 15 olefinic compounds were identified, and 21 olefins were detected in mature plants after anthesis. Both solvent extracts and collections of headspace terpenes were found to contain the same compounds in the same relative proportions suggesting that there is no selective barrier to release from plants. Approximately 25\% of the stored pool was found to be released from young seedlings per hour. The individual sesquiterpenes varied extensively in their abundance among different organs and developmental stages. Compounds could be divided into five different groups such that the members of each group always occur together in the same constant ratios to one another. Each group has a distinct distribution pattern. Group A includes the two dominant compounds, (E)-β-farnesene and α-bergamotene, and appears only after herbivore damage in seedlings, but is constitutively present in the leaves and husks after anthesis. The major compounds of group B, including α-copaene, germacrene D and δ-cadinene, were present throughout the seedling but found only in husks of mature plants. The group C compounds, β-bisabolene and an unknown sesquiterpene olefin, are restricted to the roots. The presence of group D and E compounds was confined to the leaves and husk of mature plants. The complex sesquiterpene mixture of group D is identical to the products formed by the previously identified terpene synthase TPS4, suggesting that each of the four other sesquiterpene hydrocarbon mixtures may also represent the products of a single terpene synthase. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

One element of milpa agriculture that receives a considerable amount of criticism is the burning of cut vegetation after clearing. Fire can have negative effects on ecosystems but swidden cultivators are often sophisticated managers of fire. Among the benefits of fire use in this setting is its contribution to nutrient flow and to long-term soil fertility in the form of biochar, charcoal produced by low-temperature pyrolysis in agriculture.

	doi = {10.1111/tpj.12994},
	abstract = {Over the past two decades, Zea mays (maize) has been established as a model system for the study of indirect plant defense against herbivores. When attacked by lepidopteran larvae, maize leaves emit a complex blend of volatiles, mainly composed of sesquiterpenes, to attract the natural enemies of the herbivores. This is associated with a swift transcriptional induction of terpene synthases such as TPS10; however, the molecular components controlling the complex transcriptional reprogramming in this process are still obscure. Here, by exploiting the finding that the maize TPS10 promoter retained its full responsiveness to herbivory in Arabidopsis, we identified the region from -300 to -200 of the TPS10 promoter as both necessary and sufficient for its herbivore inducibility through 5′ deletion mapping. A high-throughput screening of an Arabidopsis transcription factor library using this promoter region as the bait identified seven AP2/ERF family transcription factors. Among their close homologs in maize, EREB58 was the only gene responsive to herbivory, with a spatiotemporal expression pattern highly similar to that of TPS10. Meanwhile, EREB58 was also responsive to Jasmonate. In vivo and in vitro assays indicated that EREB58 promotes TPS10 expression by directly binding to the GCC-box within the region from -300 to -200 of the TPS10 promoter. Transgenic maize plants overexpressing EREB58 constitutively over-accumulate TPS10 transcript, and also (E)-β-farnesene and (E)-α-bergamotene, two major sesquiterpenes produced by TPS10. In contrast, jasmonate induction of TPS10 and its volatiles was abolished in EREB58-RNAi transgenic lines. In sum, these results demonstrate that EREB58 is a positive regulator of sesquiterpene production by directly promoting TPS10 expression. Significance Statement In maize, one defense response against herbivores is to increase sesquiterpene volatiles which in turn attract natural enemies of herbivores. Here we demonstrate that a jasmonate- and herbivore-responsive transcription factor promotes terpene synthase expression and production of sesquiterpene volatiles.},

Therefore, a parasitoid’s oviposition decisions will directly depend on the host, but also on plant quality. Here, we investigated the direct effects of host species and the indirect effects of the host’s food plant on the oviposition decisions and performance of the gregarious ectoparasitoid Euplectrus platyhypenae Howard (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae). With a series of no-choice experiments, we determined the oviposition and performance of the parasitoid on: (1) two caterpillar species, fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda JE Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and velvet armyworm, Spodoptera latifascia Walker, reared on maize (Zea mays L., Poaceae), (2) the same caterpillars reared on maize, bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L., Fabaceae), or squash (Cucurbita pepo L., Cucurbitaceae) leaves, and (3) S. latifascia caterpillars reared on leaves of wild and cultivated lima bean, Phaseolus lunatus L. All these insects and plants originate from Mesoamerica where they have coexisted for thousands of years in the traditional agricultural system known as Milpa in which maize, beans, and squash are planted together. We found that the preferred and best combination of host and host plant for parasitoid performance was S. frugiperda on maize. Parasitoids laid larger clutches, had higher survival, and more females and larger adults emerged from S. frugiperda reared on maize. However, when both caterpillar species were reared on squash, S. latifascia was the better host. Contrary to the literature, S. frugiperda was not able to develop on bean plants. Results from the lima bean experiment showed that parasitoid performance was best when S. latifascia was reared on leaves of cultivated compared to wild lima bean. These findings are discussed in the context of mixed cropping in which the ability of generalist parasitoids to switch among hosts and host plant species could be advantageous for pest management.},

	abstract = {Among plant secondary metabolites terpenoids are a structurally most diverse group; they function as phytoalex-ins in plant direct defense, or as signals in indirect defense responses which involves herbivores and their natural enemies. In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the investigation of the ecological role of plant terpenoids. The biosynthesis pathways of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes include the synthesis of C5 precursor isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the synthesis of the immediate diphosphate precursors, and the formation of the diverse terpenoids. Terpene synthases (TPSs) play a key role in volatile terpene synthesis. By expression of the TPS genes, significant achievements have been made on metabolic engineering to increase terpenoid production. This review mainly summarizes the recent research progress in elucidating the ecological role of terpenoids and characterization of the enzymes involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis. Spatial and temporal regulations of terpenoids metabolism are also discussed. Available online at www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/toc/jipb, www.jipb.net Terpenoids, which constitute the most abundant and structurally diverse group of plant secondary metabolites, play an important role in plant-insect, plant-pathogen, and plant-plant interactions (Dudareva et al. 2004; Paschold et al. 2006). Ter-penoids are commonly present in higher plants and more than 23 000 individual structures have been identified (Köllner et al. 2004). Terpenoids are normally produced in vegetative tissues, flowers, and, occasionally, roots (Dudareva et al. 2004). Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are the majority of volatile compounds released from plants after herbivore damage, attracting arthropods that prey on or parasitize herbivores, then avoiding further damage (Dudareva et al. 2004). In addition to volatile terpenoids, certain diterpenes and sesquiterpe-nes are phytoalexins involved in the direct defense of plants against herbivores, and microbial pathogens. Elucidation of bio-synthetic pathways and regulatory mechanisms of plant terpenoids, and dissecting the role of plant secondary metabo-lites in an ecosystem will provide a novel insight into the sustainable development of agriculture and the environment.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Phytohormones regulate the protective responses of plants against both biotic and abiotic stresses by means of synergistic or antagonistic actions referred to as signaling crosstalk. A bottleneck in crosstalk research is the quantification of numerous interacting phytohormones and regulators. The chemical analysis of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, and abscisic acid is typically achieved by using separate and complex methodologies. Moreover, pathogen-produced phytohormone mimics, such as the phytotoxin coronatine (COR), have not been directly quantified in plant tissues. We address these problems by using a simple preparation and a GC-MS-based metabolic profiling approach. Plant tissue is extracted in aqueous 1-propanol and mixed with dichloromethane. Carboxylic acids present in the organic layer are methylated by using trimethylsilyldiazomethane; analytes are volatilized under heat, collected on a polymeric absorbent, and eluted with solvent into a sample vial. Analytes are separated by using gas chromatography and quantified by using chemical-ionization mass spectrometry that produces predominantly [M+H] $^{\textrm{+}}$ parent ions. We use this technique to examine levels of COR, phytohormones, and volatile organic compounds in model systems, including {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Arabidopsis thaliana{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} during infection with {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Pseudomonas syringae{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} pv. {\textless}italic{\textgreater}tomato{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} DC3000, corn ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Zea mays{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) under herbivory by corn earworm ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Helicoverpa zea{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ), tobacco ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Nicotiana tabacum{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) after mechanical damage, and tomato ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Lycopersicon esculentum{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) during drought stress.

	abstract = {Jasmonic acid (JA) has long been hypothesized to be an important regulator of insect-induced volatile emission; however, current models are based primarily on circumstantial evidence derived from pharmacological studies. Using beet armyworm caterpillars (BAW: Spodoptera exigua) and intact corn seedlings, we examine this hypothesis by measuring both the time-course of insect-induced JA levels and the relationships between endogenous JA levels, ethylene, indole and sesquiterpenes. In separate Morning and Evening time-course trials, BAW feeding stimulated increases in JA levels within the first 4-6 h and resulted in maximal increases in JA, indole, sesquiterpenes and ethylene 8-16 h later. During BAW herbivory, increases in JA either paralleled or preceded the increases in indole, sesquiterpenes and ethylene in the Morning and Evening trials, respectively. By varying the intensity of the BAW herbivory, we demonstrate that strong positive relationships exist between the resulting variation in insect-induced JA levels and volatile emissions such as indole and the sesquiterpenes. To address potential signaling interactions between herbivore-induced JA and ethylene, plants were pretreated with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), an inhibitor of ethylene perception. 1-MCP pretreatment resulted in reduced production of ethylene and volatile emission following BAW herbivory but did not alter the insect-induced accumulation of JA. Our results strongly support a role for JA in the regulation of insect-induced volatile emission but also suggest that ethylene perception regulates the magnitude of volatile emission during herbivory.},

	abstract = {Leaves normally release small quantities of volatile chemicals, but when a plant is damaged by herbivorous insects, many more volatiles are released. The chemical identity of the volatile compounds varies with the plant species and with the herbivorous insect species. These volatiles attract both parasitic and predatory insects that are natural enemies of the herbivores. They may also induce defense responses in neighboring plants. Such chemicals , which function in communication between and among species, as well as those that serve as messengers between members of the same species, are called semio-chemicals (from the Greek "semeion," a mark or signal) (Law and Regnier, 1971). Semiochemicals emitted from a diverse group of plants and insects mediate key processes in the behavior of specific insects. Volatile phytochemicals can serve as airborne semiochemicals, promoting or deterring interactions between plants and insect herbivores. For example, wheat seedlings without herbivore damage attract aphids, whereas odors released from wheat seedlings with a high density of aphids repel other aphids (Quiroz et al., 1997). For swallowtail butterflies, volatiles from host plants enhance the effect of contact stimulants, increasing landing rates and oviposition relative to non-host plants (Feeny et al., 1989). In addition to the bouquet of compounds that render leaves attractive or disagreeable to herbivores, volatile ter-penoids and other compounds emitted from leaves in response to insect damage allow insect parasitoids (such as parasitic wasps) and predators to distinguish between infested and noninfested plants, and thus aid in locating hosts or prey (Fig. 1). These phytodistress signals, which result in an active interaction between herbivore-damaged plants and a third trophic level, have been described for several agro-ecosystems. Examples include lima bean and apple plants, which produce volatiles that attract predatory mites when damaged by spider mites (Takabayashi and Dicke, 1996), and corn and cotton plants, which release volatiles that attract hymenopterous parasitoids that attack larvae of several Lepidoptera species (Tumlinson et al., 1993). In the latter case, a parasitoid female injects her eggs when she stings, and the eggs hatch into wasp larvae inside the caterpillar. Once the caterpillar has been stung, its reproductive cycle is terminated and a new generation of wasps is produced. In all plants reported thus far, there are notable similarities in the structure of the volatile compounds that are emitted from insect-damaged leaves and from leaves distal to the site of damage. The structural uniformity in the chemical emissions from different plants with insect feeding suggests the activation of a common set of biosynthetic pathways shared by a wide range of plant families, and that the products are detectable to a broad spectrum of insect parasitoids and predators (Fig. 2). The ability of host-seeking insects to recognize and respond to such chemical cues and differentiate them from background odors indicates that insect-damaged plants emit volatile chemicals that are clearly distinguishable from those released in response to other types of damage or those released from undamaged plants. The plant's ability to differentiate between herbivore damage and a general wound response suggests the presence of elicitors associated with insect feeding that are absent from other types of leaf damage. PLANTS RESPOND TO INSECT FEEDING DAMAGE BY RELEASING GREATER AMOUNTS OF A VARIETY OF VOLATILES An undamaged plant maintains a baseline level of volatile metabolites that are released from the surface of the leaf and/or from accumulated storage sites in the leaf. These constitutive chemical reserves, which often include mono-terpenes, sesquiterpenes, and aromatics, accumulate to high levels in specialized glands or trichomes (Paré and Tumlinson, 1997a). In addition, green-leaf odors consisting of a blend of saturated and unsaturated six-carbon alcohols , aldehydes, and esters are produced by autolytic oxi-dative breakdown of membrane lipids and are released when leaves are mechanically damaged. This pattern of constitutive compounds has been analyzed in the field for perennials, including beech (Tollsten and Mü ller, 1996) and ash (Markovic et al., 1996) trees, as well as under greenhouse conditions for many herbaceous annuals, including},

JA is also required for various developmental processes such as male fertility, seed maturation, root extension, and leaf senescence. In our recently published Plant Cell paper, the multiple roles of JA in the monocotyledonous agro-economically important model plant, maize, were investigated by comprehensive analysis of JA-deficient double mutant disrupted in the two oxophytodienoate reductase genes, OPR7 and OPR8. These two genes are the closest orthologs of the Arabidopsis JA-producing OPR3 and are the only maize OPRs required for JA biosynthesis. With this mutant, we previously showed that JA is essential for both male and female reproductive development, and required for the regulation of brace root pigmentation, leaf senescence, and defense against oomycete Pythium aristosporum, and beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua). In this addendum, we expanded the investigation into the function of JA in elongation of sheaths, leaves, and roots, and its involvement in photomorphogenesis of seedlings.},

	abstract = {Plant volatiles function as important signals for herbivores, parasitoids, predators, and neighboring plants. Herbivore attack can dramatically increase plant volatile emissions in many species. However, plants do not only react to herbivore-inflicted damage, but also already start adjusting their metabolism upon egg deposition by insects. Several studies have found evidence that egg deposition itself can induce the release of volatiles, but little is known about the effects of oviposition on the volatiles released in response to subsequent herbivory. To study this we measured the effect of oviposition by Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) moths on constitutive and herbivore-induced volatiles in maize (Zea mays L.). Results demonstrate that egg deposition reduces the constitutive emission of volatiles and suppresses the typical burst of inducible volatiles following mechanical damage and application of caterpillar regurgitant, a treatment that mimics herbivory. We discuss the possible mechanisms responsible for reducing the plant's signaling capacity triggered by S. frugiperda oviposition and how suppression of volatile organic compounds can influence the interaction between the plant, the herbivore, and other organisms in its environment. Future studies should consider oviposition as a potential modulator of plant responses to insect herbivores. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

In many crop plants however, induced volatiles mediating this kind of interactions among plants, herbivores and also their natural enemies have been altered through the process of domestication. The selection of crops for increased yield may have gone at a cost of defense, possibly including defense-related volatiles. Dalbulus maidis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), a specialist leafhopper that only feeds on Zea spp., is a vector of Corn Stunt Spiroplasma, a serious maize disease. Here, we compared the volatiles released following D. maidis attack by a maize landrace and two maize hybrids of temperate and tropical background. Also, we performed behavioral assays with the leafhopper contrasting healthy non-attacked maize seedlings versus attacked seedlings. The maize landrace produced more than 6-fold larger quantities of induced volatiles compared to the maize hybrids after herbivory. Corn leafhopper females were able to detect and significantly preferred the odors of healthy seedlings over the attacked ones only in the landrace. They did not discriminate between the attacked and non-attacked hybrids. Additionally, we found that the attraction of the parasitoid wasp Anagrus virlai (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) to its host was diminished in the tested hybrids. The parasitoid was able to detect the odors of the attacked landrace, however it was unable to discriminate between healthy and attacked maize hybrid plants. These results suggest that those more domesticated germplasms may have lost the ability not only to release volatiles that avoid colonization of future herbivores, but also to attract their natural enemies in a tritrophic system.},

	abstract = {Synthetic elicitors can be used to induce resistance in plants against pathogens and arthropod herbivores. Such compounds may also change the emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles, which serve as important cues for parasitic wasps to locate their hosts. Therefore, the use of elicitors in the field may affect biological control of insect pests. To test this, we treated maize seedlings growing in a subtropical field in Mexico with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), an elicitor of defense responses against many insects, and benzo-(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH), an elicitor of resistance against certain pathogens. Volatile emission, herbivore infestation, pathogen infection, and plant performance (growth and grain yield) of treated and untreated maize plants were measured. Application of BTH slightly reduced volatile emission in maize, while MeJA increased the emission compared to control treatments. Despite the apparent changes in volatile emissions, the elicitor application did not consistently affect infestation by Spodoptera frugiperda larvae, the main insect pest found on the maize seedlings, and had only marginal effects on parasitism rates. Similarly, there were no treatment effects on infestation by other herbivores and pathogens. Results for the six replications that stretched over one summer and one winter season were highly variable, with parasitism rates and the species composition of the parasitoids differing significantly between seasons. This variability, as well as the severe biotic and abiotic stresses on young seedlings might explain why we measured only slight effects of elicitor application on pest incidence and biological control in this specific field study. Indeed, an additional field experiment under milder and more standardized conditions revealed that BTH induced significant resistance against Bipolaris maydis, a major pathogen in the experimental maize fields. Similar affects can be expected for herbivory and parasitism rates. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

This was due to the additional feeding damage done by the larvae. The role of plants in the host‐finding behaviour of parasitoids is discussed.

Les 3 composés testés ont été: des plantules de maïs endommagées par des chenilles de Spodoptera exigua (BAW); des excréments produits par les chenilles de BAW consommant du maïs; des chenilles de BAW en l'absence de plantes et d'excréments. Les plantes endommagées ont été significativement plus attractives que les excréments ou les chenilles. En expériences de choix, les excréments étaient plus attractifs que les chenilles. Différentes combinaisons de ces 3 composantes principales ont montré que l'attractivité augmentait quand les chenilles étaient associées à des feuilles endommagées. Ajouter des excréments n'augmentait pas significativement l'attractivité. Quand des chenilles étaient associées avec des feuilles endommagées, mais en présence d'écran les empêchant de consommer les feuilles, l'attractivité était celle des feuilles endommagées seules. Des feuilles de maïs n'ayant jamais été exposées aux dégâts des chenilles étaient à peine attractives. On peut en conclure que les feuilles endommagées par les chenilles sont la principale source de substances volatiles qui orientent le parasito'ide C. marginiventris vers le voisinage de ses hôtes. La consommation active par les chenilles augmente probablement la quantité de substances émises par les plantes, ce qui se traduit par une attractivité accrue. Les substances volatiles des plantes jouent un rôle dans la découverte de l'habitat de l'hôte par les parasitoïdes. De plus en plus d'éléments suggèrent qu'une interaction sophistiquée entre hôte, plante et parasitoïde sera éventuellement révélée. 1991 The Netherlands Entomological Society},

The milpa is a traditional agricultural system in which maize is intercropped with other species, such as common beans, faba beans, squashes or potatoes. Our study shows that more than two-thirds of the 1,205 plots recorded were under the milpa system, with a great diversity of crop combinations. As shown with the 357 plots for which specific yields were available, milpa systems present higher total productivity than monocropped maize, expressed as total energy yield of the harvested crops in the respective system, and were also better at providing the recommended daily allowances of fourteen essential nutrients, based on a Potential Nutrient Adequacy (PNA) indicator. Maize-bean-potato, maize-potato, and maize-bean-faba intercrops had the highest PNAs, and monocropped maize, the lowest. These results support the implementation of milpa systems tailored to different agro-ecologies in order to improve nutrition in the WHG and a variety of similar regions.},

In maize, transcripts of genes that facilitate jasmonic acid (JA) signaling are more abundant in juvenile compared to adult leaf primordia; exogenous application of JA both extends the juvenile phase and delays the decline in miR156 levels. To test the hypothesis that JA promotes juvenility, we measured JA and meJA levels using LC-MS in successive stages of leaf one development and in later leaves at stages leading up to phase change in both normal maize and phase change mutants. We concurrently measured gibberellic acid (GA), required for the timely transition to the adult phase. Jasmonic acid levels increased from germination through leaf one differentiation, declining in later formed leaves as the shoot approached phase change. In contrast, levels of GA were low in leaf one after germination and increased as the shoot matured to the adult phase. Multiple doses of exogenous JA resulted in the production of as many as three additional juvenile leaves. We analyzed two transcript expression datasets to investigate when gene regulation by miR156 begins in the context of spatiotemporal patterns of JA and GA signaling. Quantifying these hormones in phase change mutants provided insight into how these two hormones control phase-specific patterns of differentiation. We conclude that the hormone JA is a leaf-provisioned signal that influences the duration, and possibly the initiation, of the juvenile phase of maize by controlling patterns of differentiation in successive leaf primordia.},

	abstract = {Many parasitic wasps (parasitoids) exploit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by herbivore-infested plants in order to locate their hosts, but it remains largely unknown which specific compounds within the volatile blends elicit the attractiveness to parasitoids. One way of studying the importance of specific VOCs is to test the attractiveness of odor blends from which certain compounds have been emitted. We used this approach by testing the attraction of naive and experienced females of the two parasitoids Cotesia marginiventris and Microplitis rufiventris to partially altered volatile blends of maize seedlings (Zea mays var. Delprim) infested with Spodoptera littoralis larvae. Adsorbing filter tubes containing carbotrap-C or silica were installed in a four-arm olfactometer between the odor source vessels and the arms of the olfactometer. The blends breaking through were tested for chemical composition and attractiveness to the wasps. Carbotrap-C adsorbed most of the sesquiterpenes, but the breakthrough blend remained attractive to naive C. marginiventris females. Silica adsorbed only some of the more polar VOCs, but this essentially eliminated all attractiveness to naive C. marginiventris, implying that among the adsorbed compounds there are some that play key roles in the attraction. Unlike C. marginiventris, M. rufiventris was still attracted to the latter blend, showing that parasitoids with a comparable biology may employ different strategies in their use of plant-provided cues to locate hosts. Results from similar experiments with modified odor blends of caterpillar-infested cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) indicate that key VOCs in different plant species vary greatly in quality and/or quantity. Finally, experienced wasps were more strongly attracted to a specific blend after they perceived the blend while ovipositing in a host. Considering the high number of distinct adsorbing materials available today, this in situ modification of complex volatile blends provides a new and promising approach pinpointing on key attractants within these blends. Advantages and disadvantages compared to other approaches are discussed. © The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Summary: Genetic manipulation of plant volatile emissions is a promising tool to enhance plant defences against herbivores. However, the potential costs associated with the manipulation of specific volatile synthase genes are unknown. Therefore, we investigated the physiological and ecological effects of transforming a maize line with a terpene synthase gene in field and laboratory assays, both above- and below ground. The transformation, which resulted in the constitutive emission of (E)-β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, was found to compromise seed germination, plant growth and yield. These physiological costs provide a possible explanation for the inducibility of an (E)-β-caryophyllene-synthase gene in wild and cultivated maize. The overexpression of the terpene synthase gene did not impair plant resistance nor volatile emission. However, constitutive terpenoid emission increased plant apparency to herbivores, including adults and larvae of the above ground pest Spodoptera frugiperda, resulting in an increase in leaf damage. Although terpenoid overproducing lines were also attractive to the specialist root herbivore Diabrotica virgifera virgifera below ground, they did not suffer more root damage in the field, possibly because of the enhanced attraction of entomopathogenic nematodes. Furthermore, fewer adults of the root herbivore Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardii were found to emerge near plants that emitted (E)-β-caryophyllene and α-humulene. Yet, overall, under the given field conditions, the costs of constitutive volatile production overshadowed its benefits. This study highlights the need for a thorough assessment of the physiological and ecological consequences of genetically engineering plant signals in the field to determine the potential of this approach for sustainable pest management strategies. © 2013 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

This hypothesis is based on evidence for a metabolic cost associated with defence, and on evidence that increases in yield generally come from the re-partitioning of photoas-similates rather than from fundamental increases in photosynthetic rates. We propose that for plants in which domestication and crop development constitute strong selection for increased growth and reproduction, reallocation of resources may result in lower defence against insects. We examine this hypothesis by means of comparative studies of growth, reproduction and resistance in a complex of maizes and closely related wild taxa, the teosintes. The results of these studies are consistent with assumptions of dierential investment in growth and reproduction between wild and domesticated plants. A wild perennial grew slowest and had lowest grain production, while a modern cultivar grew fastest and had the highest grain yield. A wild annual and a land-race cultivar were intermediate. Damage from a diverse assemblage of folivorous insects, and from a specialist stemboring lepidopteran larva, ®t the defence predictions closely. A gradient of attack levels suggests that the wild perennial is most defended, followed in descending order by the wild annual, the land-race cultivar and the modern high-yielding variety. Alternative hypotheses for this pattern are consistent with some, but not all, of our data.},

Maize plants can be induced to produce the same blend of attractive volatiles by treating them with regurgi-tant of Spodoptera species.

	abstract = {Main conclusion: Maize produces an array of herbivore-induced terpene volatiles that attract parasitoids to infested plants and a suite of pathogen-induced non-volatile terpenoids with antimicrobial activity to defend against pests. Plants rely on complex blends of constitutive and dynamically produced specialized metabolites to mediate beneficial ecological interactions and protect against biotic attack. One such class of metabolites are terpenoids, a large and structurally diverse class of molecules shown to play significant defensive and developmental roles in numerous plant species. Despite this, terpenoids have only recently been recognized as significant contributors to pest resistance in maize (Zea mays), a globally important agricultural crop. The current review details recent advances in our understanding of biochemical structures, pathways and functional roles of maize terpenoids. Dependent upon the lines examined, maize can harbor more than 30 terpene synthases, underlying the inherent diversity of maize terpene defense systems. Part of this defensive arsenal is the inducible production of volatile bouquets that include monoterpenes, homoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which often function in indirect defense by enabling the attraction of parasitoids and predators. More recently discovered are a subset of sesquiterpene and diterpene hydrocarbon olefins modified by cytochrome P450s to produce non-volatile end-products such kauralexins, zealexins, dolabralexins and β-costic acid. These non-volatile terpenoid phytoalexins often provide effective defense against both microbial and insect pests via direct antimicrobial and anti-feedant activity. The diversity and promiscuity of maize terpene synthases, coupled with a variety of secondary modifications, results in elaborate defensive layers whose identities, regulation and precise functions are continuing to be elucidated.},

	abstract = {2004. Costs of induced volatile production in maize. Á/ Oikos 105: 168 Á/180. Herbivore-induced plant volatiles have been shown to serve as indirect defence signals that attract natural enemies of herbivores. Parasitoids and predators exploit these plant-provided cues to locate their victims and several herbivores are repelled by the volatiles. Recently, benefits, in terms of plant fitness, from the action of the parasitoids were shown for a few systems. However, the cost of production of herbivore-induced volatiles for the plant remains unknown. Here, we estimate the fitness cost of the production of induced volatiles in maize, Zea mays. Plants were treated with regurgitant of Spodoptera littoralis or with the elicitor volicitin and we measured dry weight of plant parts at specific times after treatments. After a two-week treatment period, the dry-weight of leaves of induced plants was lower than that of un-induced plants, suggesting a metabolic cost for induced defence. However, maize plants seem to compensate for this loss during subsequent growth, since seed production at maturity was not different for unharmed plants and plants treated with caterpillar regurgitant. For volicitin treated plants a small but significant reduction in seed production was found. It is likely that the treatments also induced the production of other defence compounds, which will contribute to the cost. Yet, a comparison of six maize inbred lines with distinct differences in volatile emissions showed a strong correlation between the intensity of induced emissions and reduction in plant performance. An analysis of the terpenoids that accumulated in the leaves of the inbred lines revealed non-volatilised compounds are constitutively present in maize and only the volatilised compounds are induced. Interestingly, the lines that released the largest amounts of induced volatiles also contained more of the non-volatile terpenoids. Based on these results and results from a previous study on the benefits of attracting parasitoids, we conclude that costs of induced volatile production in plants are counterbalanced by the benefits as long as natural enemies of the herbivores are present in the environment. Natural enemies of herbivores can use volatiles that are produced by plants under herbivore attack to locate their prey (Whitman 1988, Vet and Dicke 1992, Turlings et al. 1995, Dicke and Vet 1999). These herbivore-induced volatile emissions are suggested to function as an indirect defence for plants. Indeed, several field studies have shown that parasitism or predation was higher on plants that produced induced volatiles or on plants that were treated with synthetic volatiles, when compared to plants that did not produce or carry these volatiles (Titayavan and Altieri 1990, Drukker et al. 1995, Thaler 1999, Kessler and Baldwin 2001). It has also been shown that induced volatiles can repel herbivores and act as direct defence for the plants. For example, aphids (Bernasconi et al. 1998, Glinwood and Petterson 2000) and mites (Dicke and Dijkman 1992) are},

	abstract = {Animal communities are vulnerable to agricultural practices. Intensive farming considerably reduces overall arthropod diversity, but not necessarily pest abundance. Natural control of herbivores in agroecosystems is accomplished by predators and parasitoids, but in intensified agricultural regimes, the chemical control used to reduce pest abundances also affects pests’ natural enemies. To achieve more sustainable agriculture, there is a need to better understand the susceptibility of predators to conventional management. In order to quantify the arthropod diversity associated with different schemes of agricultural management of maize, we evaluated agricultural fields under two contrasting management regimens in Michoacán, México during the spring–summer cycle of 2011. Arthropod communities were evaluated in plots with conventional high-input versus low-input agriculture in two sites—one rainfed and one with irrigation. The experimental units consisted of twelve 1\&nbsp;ha agricultural plots. To sample arthropods, we used 9 pitfall traps per agricultural plot. During the sampling period, we detected a total of 14,315 arthropods belonging to 12 Orders and 253 morphospecies. Arthropod community composition was significantly different between the sites, and in the rain-fed site, we also found differences between management practices. Predators, particularly ants, were more abundant in low-input sites. Herbivory levels were similar in all fields, with an average of 18\% of leaf area lost per plant. Our results suggest that conventional farming is not reducing herbivore abundances or damage inflicted to plants, but is affecting arthropod predators. We discuss repercussions for sustainable agriculture.},

[3H]-L-Volicitin rapidly, reversibly, and saturably bound to enriched plasma membrane fractions isolated from Z. mays leaves with an apparent Kd of 1.3 nM and a Hill coefficient of 1.07. Analog studies showed that the L-Gln and hydroxy moieties of volicitin play an important role in binding. Treatment of plants with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) increased the total binding of [3H]-L-volicitin to the enriched plasma membrane more than threefold, suggesting that MeJA activates transcription of the gene encoding the binding protein. S. exigua feeding also increased total binding fourfold. Cycloheximide pretreatment of plants significantly decreased binding of radiolabeled volicitin to the enriched plasma membrane. These data provide the first experimental evidence that initiation of plant defenses in response to herbivore damage can be mediated by a binding protein-ligand interaction.},

	abstract = {Corn defense systems against insect herbivory involve activation of genes that lead to metabolic reconfigurations to produce toxic compounds, proteinase inhibitors, oxidative enzymes, and behavior-modifying volatiles. Similar responses occur when the plant is exposed to methyl jasmonate (MeJA). To compare the defense responses between stalk borer feeding and exogenous MeJA on a transcriptional level, we employed deep transcriptome sequencing methods following Ostrinia furnacalis leaf feeding and MeJA leaf treatment. 39,636 genes were found to be differentially expressed with O. furnacalis feeding, MeJA application, and O. furnacalis feeding and MeJA application. Following Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the up- or down- regulated genes, many were implicated in metabolic processes, stimuli-responsive catalytic activity, and transfer activity. Fifteen genes that indicated significant changes in the O. furnacalis feeding group: LOX1, ASN1, eIF3, DXS, AOS, TIM, LOX5, BBTI2, BBTI11, BBTI12, BBTI13, Cl-1B, TPS10, DOX, and A20/AN1 were found to almost all be involved in jasmonate defense signaling pathways. All of the data demonstrate that the jasmonate defense signal pathway is a major defense signaling pathways of Asian corn borer's defense against insect herbivory. The transcriptome data are publically available at NCBI SRA: SRS965087.},

Here we report on a previously unidentified enzyme, indole-3-glycerol phosphate lyase (IGL), that catalyzes the formation of free indole and is selectively activated by volicitin.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Plants can defend themselves from herbivorous insects by emitting volatile chemical signals that attract natural enemies of the herbivore. For example, maize seedlings attacked by beet armyworm larvae ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Spodoptera exigua{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) produce a mixture of terpenoid and indole volatiles that serve to attract parasitic wasps. A key step in terpenoid biosynthesis is the conversion of acyclic prenyl diphosphates to terpenoid compounds by specific terpenoid synthases (cyclases). We have cloned a maize sesquiterpene cyclase gene, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}stc1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} , by transposon tagging and have identified two deletion mutations of the gene. The {\textless}italic{\textgreater}stc1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} gene is located on chromosome 9S and does not seem to have a closely related ortholog in the maize genome. It is induced 15- to 30-fold in maize leaves by beet armyworm larvae feeding or by application of purified volicitin, the insect-derived elicitor, at a mechanically wounded site. {\textless}italic{\textgreater}stc1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} induction is systemic, because undamaged leaves of the same plant show a similar increase in {\textless}italic{\textgreater}stc1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} transcription. Analysis of volatiles from volicitin-treated seedlings revealed that a major naphthalene-based sesquiterpene was present in wild-type seedlings but absent in the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Ac{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -insertion and x-ray-deletion mutants. Therefore, we have identified a maize gene that responds to caterpillar herbivory by producing a chemical defense signal that most likely serves to attract natural enemies of the herbivore. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
