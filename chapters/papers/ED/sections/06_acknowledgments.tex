% From thesis:
% Yu Han from the Geosensors and Engineering Geodesy Group at ETH provided
% us with the necessary equipment for the multi-spectral tests. She also set up the
% equipment and helped us conduct our measurements.
% Dr. Petra D‘Odorico from WSL loaned us the MicaSense Multispectral Camera and
% provided important feedback.
% Alexander Barden from the Robotics and Perception Group at UZH designed the
% 3D printed parts necessary for the setup of several measurements.
