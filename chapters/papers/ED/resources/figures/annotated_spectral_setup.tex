    \caption[Multi-Spectral Material Differentiation Setup]{The setup for taking multi-spectral images consists of a full-spectrum light source that is chopped and sent through a filter for each wavelength that is measured. The reflection of the flashing filtered light on the sample is recorded by the camera.}
